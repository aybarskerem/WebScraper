"Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray (Latest Model) Z11B000E3","$1,459.94",5.0,"
  I had a 2016 MBP and noticed that when editing 4k video it was almost impossible. I am not an editing pro but its been a hobby for 18 years. I was very hopeful that upgrading to the new M1 chip would help that. my old computer was only an 8Gig so I upgraded to a 16Gig. even though Adobe PP does not support the M1 chip yet. it still was lightning fast. rendering video that used to take 4 hours now take on average 20 min. Now when I think about doing a video project I get excited and not discouraged. If you are looking for an upgrade. you will not be disappointed.

  What was once a difficult thing to accomplish on a Mac is now a dream! This thing plays games just like you would on your ps4. Comparable quality for sure. Not sure about ps5 since I don’t own one. But definitely enjoy it now as much as playing on my ps4.

"2020 Lenovo ThinkPad E15 15.6"" FHD Full HD (1920x1080) Business Laptop (Intel 10th Quad Core i5-10210U, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD) Type-C, HDMI, Windows 10 Pro + HDMI Cable",$965.00,4.0,"
  I bought this laptop so I could work at places other than my office. My more device-savvy kid picked the laptop and the specs, so if you’re looking for a technical review, this isn’t it. I’m running Office in whatever version they’re calling it these days. 365? My bread & butter is running QuickBooks Desktop (QBDT) and that program can be a bit of a resource hog. My new ThinPad has handled it beautifully. I liked that I could add the Lenovo app and customize my settings even more than what windows offers. This laptop is super light and thin - she’s practically a supermodel. I love that I can toggle a slide and a red dot shows me the camera is closed. The slide is a little hard to see because it’s black in black so I took a metallic silver sharpie and marked it. Problem solved. I like the feel of the 10-key, but I have smaller hands. Someone with larger hands might not find it roomy enough. The matte surface is pretty, but it definitely shows fingerprints. I was cleaning the cover pretty much daily. That got old quick so I got a cute skin. Always a work around.  Keep in mind, I’m not an expert, I’m an end user and I think this laptop  will do nicely. When the box arrived the charger was missing. I immediately emailed the seller and they sent one right out. Mistakes happen, but they were very responsive.

  Bought this computer for personal use, No Gaming, No Video watching, Just for internet access, occasional Word and Excel use.  Within the first hour of use, I got an error message "" Critical Process Died"" message, and everything froze up.  Had to turn the computer off and restart which cleared the message and allowed me to use it again.  Now I can't run for more than an hour without it CRASHING again and again with the same error message.  After searching the web for user blogs, I found that this problem has been around for years with Lenovo products.  I am returning this Lenovo Thinkpad E15, but come to find out I will be charged a 20% restocking fee for something that hasn't worked properly out of the box.  What a SCAM industry, BUYER BEWARE!!!!!

  This laptop is all it's cracked up to be. I'm using it primarily for recording multitrack audio. That takes power and memory. The E15 has both. So far it's just what I was looking for.

  My order arrived on time and was undamaged.  Great purchase, had no issues with upgrades or connection to wifi. I was able to immediately use the Thinkpad, missing the longer battery life. The computer starts quickly and was able to download 57MB in a few minutes.  Note it's a bit older so not an intel Core i7 or fingerprint unlock functionality.  Otherwise, it's a pretty decent purchase for business computer.

  I got this computer specifically for the keyboard.  4 months into it, the bracket breaks on my ""k"" key.  It's under waranty, so Lenovo will fix it, but it will take 3+ weeks and I won't be able to wor.  I can't get a loaner, because I didn't purchase the laptop directly from Lenovo, so I have no way to mae a claim.  It's pretty frustrating.  Outside of an obscenely long repair job from the manufacturer, the seller who purchased it (Issaquah Highlands Tech) from Lenovo is washing their hands because it lasted more than a month (lol) which is the minimum that amazon requires (lol).  So I would avoid using this seller, and I would advise considering buying directly from the manufacturer purchases like these.  This is my second Lenovo, the first being a Yoga 910 that lasted many years.  The eyboard on this one lasted 4 months, and that's specifically why I got it.  Pretty frustrating to say the least.Also, the camera is very low quality, the screen is not very bright at certain angles, and while the layout of the keys is very nice, the quality of the eyboard is questionable at best.  If I could do it over, I would definitely not have chosen this computer or this seller.

  I am VERY disappointed especially for the money. I mainly got this to work with my pictures at the same time I upgraded my camera. I only got this laptop was because my computer tech son did the research for me and suggested it. I have only used it 3 or 4 times in the last month since 1) my youngest son can not participate in sports right now due to COVID and 2) COVID in general.I just went to use it to look up some stuff really quick and the entire top row of letters aren’t working!!! NONE of them! Nothing has been spilled on it, it has stayed safe and sound in a drawer on my desk except for the couple of times I’ve used it.I’m not a happy camper with this purchase

  I purchased (& paid more) for the Thinkpad mainly for it's keyboard. Silly, I know, but many laptops have horrible flat keys. I LOVE my Thinkpad!! I was extra impressed it didn't come with all the extra trial software you get when you pick one up at a big box retailer!

  The unit I received (16GB RAM, 512 GB NVME SSD) was unable to wake up after going to sleep due to idle. If you use the [Start]->Power->Sleep menu option in Win10, it was able to wake up. This was also a 1st gen E15, not the latest 2nd Gen E15 that is widely available. The SSD was an aftermarket brand ""OEM Genuine"" with what appears to be a solid Silicon Motion controller. Otherwise the keyboard was comfortable and the design looks and feels sharp. I am just very disappointed with the inability to wake up from sleep - and I wonder if this has anything to do with the aftermarket upgrades.

  This is the perfect laptop for me. Extremely fast bootup, actually very fast everything. I do quite a bit on Excel, it loads almost instantly. Browsing speeds are very good even with my mediocre ISP. I really like this computer, It does everything a laptop should very well.  I haven't tried any gaming on it, but it's not a gaming laptop.

  This thing is complete garbage. I bought it for my dad, and I spent an hour setting it up, but it immediately disabled the touchpad (as in completely wiped it from the system). Any effort to restore it failed, so I had to do a complete reset on it just to get back one of the most basic features of any such device.This is the last time I will ever buy a Lenovo product. Not remotely worth the frustration.

  The 10th gen i3 gets the job done. We're not using it for gaming; just needed a replacement for my wife's aging Chromebook. It's super snappy and smooth with everyday web browsing, Office app usage, etc. I do wish they put a backlight in the keyboard, but not a deal breaker. Have also seen a few reviews online complaining about screen ""wash out"" but we have seen none of that. I'm not sure how many people use their laptops outside.. the brightness is perfect indoors but no clue how it would perform outside (not something we'll ever need). Good purchase, great seller.

"Lenovo Chromebook S330 Laptop, 14-Inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, MediaTek MT8173C Processor, 4GB LPDDR3, 64GB eMMC, Chrome OS, 81JW0000US, Business Black",$279.99,4.0,"
  This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.

  The FHD (1920x1080p) version of the Lenovo S330 definitely does NOT have an IPS display. The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients.Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's. It'll work...but why?

  ... you receive a written promise from Lenovo quality control that they'll pay YOU for the time you'll need to spend doing their job for them. I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue.The value proposition for this Chromebook is that you can simply open the box, and get started working, hassle-free.  Value has not been delivered. If I wanted this much aggravation, I'd run one of my old Dell's with Vista.UPDATE: 4/23. Ran powerwash two more times. Spoke with Amazon. Spoke with Lenovo. Ran complete recovery of Chrome OS. Still freezes and crashes. Just ordered a second one for arrival 4/23, and am returning this one. Perhaps this one is just a lemon. If the second machine works as it should, I'll update here. If it doesn't, I'll return it also and post a second review. Total time wasted so far: 12 hours and counting.

  I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. However, it arrived as scheduled in great condition. We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it. Would recommend!

"LG Gram 17Z90P - 17"" WQXGA (2560x1600) Ultra-Lightweight Laptop, Intel evo with 11th gen CORE i7 1165G7 CPU , 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Alexa Built-in, 19.5 Hours Battery, Thunderbolt 4, Black - 2021","$1,687.13",5.0,"
  UPDATE March 23, 2020:It's been a month-and-a-half since my original review (below). I still very much love this laptop. Admittedly, the ""Bad"" list (below) might sound overly negative, but I'm just being real. The laptop isn't perfect, but *for me* the pros still outweigh the cons and I'd still buy this again in an instant. It's totally understandable if some of these things are deal-breakers for other people -- but if you still get the laptop, hopefully this review helps you understand what you're getting.Good:- Still love the large screen and light weight (doesn't feel bulky to me)- Still enjoy the keyboard layout and number pad- So far, no bends or dents. The lid hinge is still tight/stable.- Trackpad works well, feels good.- The screen and resolution are bright and crisp enough for me.Bad (although none of these are deal-breakers for me, some of them are annoying):- The included charger charges SOOOO slowly. The laptop takes hours to charge. Even going from 20% to say 70% takes forever -- it's only a little better if you shut it off/standby/hibernate first. This is my biggest complaint.- The WiFi takes forever to reconnect when resuming Windows from standby or hibernate. This is my second biggest complaint. It seems to happen on different WiFi networks and a none of my other laptops have had this problem on those same WiFi networks. I Googled a lot to try to fix this, but nothing worked -- including latest drivers. This is probably more of a Windows config/driver problem, but it's still happening on my laptop and I can't fix it.- Battery life isn't great. When studying I get maybe 5 hours before draining to 20ish%. Obviously this will be different for everyone because we all run different apps or have different things running in the background, but I'm surprised it isn't better.- Speakers aren't very good. They're not super loud but not very clear either. Pretty disappointing. They sound like they vibrate/resonate when playing particular frequencies. The speakers aren't blown for sure, they just rattle in those very specific instances for some reason.- I've resorted to only using hibernate when I close the laptop lid (versus just going into standby). The laptop doesn't seem to handle standby well and still runs for quite a while before actually going to standby (if at all). Sometimes I put the laptop in a fitted soft case and I later find out that Windows never really went on standby and I now have a dead battery or I find that the laptop is really hot from running while trapped in the case. Hibernate is fine and it's not slow, but it's annoying that standby doesn't work like it does for other laptops. Probably a Windows issue if anything, but I couldn't find any fixes for this -- and I've tried a lot.- I wish the track pad was centered relative to the keyboard's home row and space bar, i.e. a little bit more to the left.- The CPU has throttled down to 0.4 GHz (400 MHz) on occasion. Not a lot though. I wasn't doing anything intensive. Maybe Windows was indexing? Generally, doesn't seem to thermal throttle much though.=====ORIGINAL REVIEW February 4, 2020:I decided I wanted a lightweight, large screen laptop so the LG Gram 17 was really the only option -- other light laptops aren't 17"", and other 17"" laptops aren't lightweight. Because of this I admit that this laptop is on the pricey side, but that's to be expected if there are no direct competitors. I've been waiting for the 10th Gen Intel processor. It runs at a lower clock speed than the previous 8th Gen processor, but according to benchmarks it's faster and has better power efficiency. The 10 nm vs the 8th Gen 14 nm manufacturing helps. I haven't had this long enough yet to comment on everyday use, but I'll tell you my first impressions.Similar to the previous model, it's lightweight with a large screen. The CPU isn't super fast, but that wasn't what was important to me. I wanted long battery life and a large screen. I'm a student so both of these benefit me more than a super-fast processor. The processor is fast enough for what I need it for. A lot of YouTube reviewers don't like this laptop because they think the CPU is under-powered -- they think the only people who want 17"" screens are content creators like them, but they're not understanding the audience that actually appreciate what this laptop has to offer. My previous laptop had a 4k 15"" touchscreen. I'll have to say that I thought I'd use those options more than I really did. I appreciate that this laptop has a lower resolution (but still high enough to be crisp) to help with battery life. Also, I didn't find the touchscreen useful at all so I'm glad this doesn't have it.Some of the things I've read from the previous year's model is that the laptop would consume more power than it could charge when under load (maybe high CPU-intensive tasks? or charging a phone on USB?). So essentially people would say that their battery would drain even while charging, which I think is pretty bad. Hopefully the power-efficiency of the new CPU will help with that, but I don't know if that's still a problem. Also, people said that the CPU would thermal throttle with the 8th Gen Intel. Again, not sure yet if this model will do that, but I'm hoping that the lower clock speed and the better efficiency of the 10th Gen will alleviate that. Also, an LG spokesperson somewhere said that this laptop has ""better cooling"" than the previous gen. I don't know if that's true, but if it is, hopefully that helps as well.Here are my other first impressions. The keyboard keys are quiet but a little mushy. Not the best, but it's good enough. Also, the new keyboard layout with the expanded backspace and enter keys and the four-column number pad seem better than the previous model. When I first typed on the keyboard, I, like a lot of other reviewers, wasn't used to shifting my typing to the left of the screen, but I'm confident that I'll get used to it. I don't use the number pad a lot, but on my desktop I do use it from time to time, so I think the laptop having it isn't a con. Having the proper number pad layout was important to me though because I type by muscle memory and am really fast with the number pad when I need it. The screen is bright enough. I don't like how glossy it is, but this is easily fixable. All my previous laptops had glossy screens and I always covered it up with anti-glare screen protectors. If you can install them correctly, then it's just as good as having an OEM anti-glare screen. People who complain about glossy screens don't usually know that they can correct the issue pretty easily. The trackpad works really well. It's smooth and has a good texture and feels similar to a Macbook Pro which is a good thing. The clickiness of it though is a bit mushy and soft (meaning the travel to push down on the trackpad to click isn't super-deep and it doesn't have a terribly satisfying click to it), but it's adequate and not horrible. I think it's fine. The fingerprint reader worked well, just as good as other laptops I've had. One thing I don't like is that it has Windows 10 Home instead of Pro. Personally I use Bitlocker and would have preferred Pro for this. I may upgrade, but it's an extra cost.Spec-wise, here are some things that I noticed that some people might find useful. The memory is faster than the previous model's. It runs at 3200 MHz instead of 2400 MHz (see screenshot). The CPU base clock speed is slower (1.3 GHz vs 1.8 GHz) and the turbo is slower (3.9 GHz vs 4.6 GHz), but according to benchmarks if the 10th Gen has better processing power, better efficiency, runs cooler, and contributes to longer battery life, then I think this is a win. People would say that the 8th Gen would thermal throttle so getting the max turbo wasn't attainable anyway, so hopefully the new CPU will fix this. One thing I didn't like was that they include two 512 GB M.2 SSDs. Why not just one 1 TB? I saw that another store has the same LG model but with only one 512 GB for $350 cheaper. Looking back on it, I should've bought that and use the difference to upgrade to one 1 TB or 2 TB SSD and sell the 512 GB. I was really hoping they would have at least set up the two SSDs in a RAID 0 configuration so I could have one logical 1 TB drive, but they don't. I included a screenshot of the SSDs that are included (Samsung MZVLB512HAJQ, M.2, 3000 MB/s seq. read, 270K IOPS ran. read, PRIe Gen 3 x4, 1800 MB/s seq. write, 420K IOPS ran. write -- according to Samsung's web site). I also included the TPM information that's listed in the BIOS. Again, because Bitlocker is important to me, I was interested in the TPM. My family's phones and WiFi router all use WiFi 6 (802.11ax) so I'm glad this laptop has it to take advantage of my home network's infrastructure. I can confirm that this laptop also supports the new WPA3 which my router and phones are also using.The things included with the laptop are just the tiny power brick and an Ethernet to USB-C adapter. I love how small and light the power brick is, but I guess we'll have to see if it's under-powered. I've also read that you can charge this laptop using USB-C power delivery. I'm not sure of the wattage it allows, but this is something that I'd like to look into.So all in all, it's too soon for me to really give a long-term review, but I did want to give some information which isn't really shown anywhere else (LG's website, etc.). Yes, the laptop is pricey for what it is, but again, it's the only lightweight laptop that comes in 17"". LG probably won't lower the price until there's more competition in this area, so the high price is expected. Also, this is a niche product. Only certain people want the big screen, the light weight, and moderate processing power. All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase so far. I really do appreciate the better keyboard layout. A non-standard keyboard layout (3-column number pad) is a deal breaker for me, which is why I waited for this version of the laptop rather than getting the previous version.

  Initial impressions of the laptop (weight, battery life, size) are great as written by other reviewers. But after service, driver support and warranty (which no reviewers wrote about) are where the problems are with this laptop. I learnt all this the hard way.Warranty is void on this computer the moment you open the back cover to upgrade your SSD or RAM. This is an up-gradable laptop with an empty SSD slot, and a removable RAM slot.All the Youtube influences talk about how lightweight and configurable the laptop is but they don't tell you that the warranty is void when you open the back cover.Also, if there is a problem with the laptop, you need to send it with the SSD inside to their Michigan repair center, and it will take ten business days for them to ship your laptop back. If you want to remove the SSD (it contains all your information and passwords), before sending a defective laptop, warranty is again void.I learn't all this by speaking with their call center agent. When I asked them why have an empty SSD slot then? The answer was, ""You should upgrade it after the warranty period is over! "".What they are doing is illegal in the United States. This is a violation of Magnuson-Moss Warrany Act. Companies can't void a consumer's warranty or deny warranty coverage solely because the consumer uses a part made by someone else or gets someone not authorized by the company to perform service on the product.There should be a way Amazon forces these companies to clearly state the warranty of their products on Amazon's website for their customers benefit. 1800$ is not chump change.Four Months after Use:1. Update drivers are not present on LG Website.2. Customer wait times are horrible when you call technical support. Email support is non existent. You cannot reply back to the email, technical support will send you. You will be directed to a chatbot, that doesn't even automatically take you to the right division in LG - In this case computers.3. Computer has a Windows App called LG Update Center, where you can update drivers, software etc for the laptop. The issue is, they don't tell you the release date, release notes, or anything about the update on the App.4. When I emailed technical support about this issue (was trying to update the BIOS, and I asked the release date of the bios, as it wasn't present in the LG Update Center App), they directed me to go to Phoenix Bios website and download from there directly the latest drivers. Problem is Phoenix bios makes you install spamware and charges your credit card. Do not install the biosagentplus spamware. You will waste another one day cleaning up the LG computer.I do like the weight of the laptop. But after service doesn't exist. Warranty is useless. Company is good at making Washing Machines and Dryers and they tried to make Cell-Phones, and failed. Now they are trying to make laptops, and don't have a clue of how to go about software updates, customer support and Warranty issues.

  I use my computer to work, listen to music, stream movies.  I'm hard of hearing and often have the volume all the way up.  You can't do that with this one, the voices sound like they are in a tin can.  For as much as this cost ($1700), I would have expected better speakers.  My previous computer, at less than half the cost of this one, had better speakers.Update: I also watch education webinars for work.  Every since video from here, netflix or amazon prime, doesn't line up the video with the audio.  I can go to 2 other computers in the house and have no issue.  A new computer should not work like this.

  Windows 10 FAILEDI have had a nightmare getting this Laptop up and running.  Windows 10 forces you to create a Microsoft account to start up the laptop.  Did it occur to Microsoft that I DO NOT WANT AN ACCOUNT WITH  THEM.  I bought a laptop with an operating system.  I don't necessary want to be FORCED to run everything thru MICROSOFT.Terrible experience......

  Laptop was delivered within a week. Arrived as described. Windows setup has certainly improved. Almost idiot proof. On the other side, I thought I purchased windows operation system without the Win S mode. ( This allows app download only through Microsoft store.

  Unlike other products I've had, the setup was quick and easy. I do miss my back-lit keyboard and wish the markings on the keys were a little more distinct since I'm slightly vision challenged at this point in life, but I'm happy that it's so quick and responsive!

  I bought this laptop for college, being a freshman I was looking for something affordable that would last. I got the core i5 10th gen and I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I had thought about getting a mac but price wise it was out of range. The pavilion is very smooth and crisp in a way. I use it for online class and I have to run some programs for my science classes. It has NOT let me down. I've been using it for about a month now and it still works like new. The setup took me like 15 minutes when I first got it. The only things that I believe could be a con for some is that the battery will not last a whole day. I start class at around 8:20 am and around 12 pm the battery is dead, there is a battery saver button tho and it usually let's my battery last an extra hour or so. Tablet mode is fun, I don't usually use it so I have no comment on that. Regardless, very good product for the price. Would 100% recommend for college students. I don't think this would be a good choice for gaming tho. (sorry for the stickers!)Edit: it has been almost a year since I bought this laptop. It's very sturdy tho it seems light, I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. I take it with me on my backpack (usually besides my tennis racket) again, no dents or scratches. I dropped water on it too a few times, works like new (not saying that it is waterproof, maybe I was lucky) but very strong overall. I've taken a few coding classes that include python, HTML, and CSS and it runs it with no problem. It is very fast, very very fast, personally I keep photos, music, documents and such in an USB which leaves my laptop pretty empty so it could be because of that. Camera is pretty good, gets you through zoom, speakers are good as well. Overall, a year later and I still think this laptop is a 5/5.

  Many things I love about this laptop. Great battery life, it is lightweight it is touchscreen and has tablet mode. I picked it because it had a backlit keyboard in the specs but it does not (but not bugged enough to send it back). I am annoyed at the placement of the power button it is on the side where you grab the laptop to move it and I keep bumping it and turning off the computer. Getting knocked out of Zoom meetings is really annoying. Again I will deal with it but will definitely think about his when I am looking for a new computer.

  HP Pavilion x360 14-inch 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD Storage, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Amazon Alexa Voice Compatible (14-dh2011nr, Natural Silver)Look and FeelWith the exception of the hinges, the laptop shell is entirely made of plastic.  The finish on the top (opposite the screen) is painted to mimic the look of  brushed aluminum.  It looks pretty convincing whilst it's new but I expect that as it gets scratched over the course of its lifetime it will be very obvious even from a distance that it's just painted plastic.The hinge is very nicely designed, moves smoothly and holds sturdily.  There's no wiggle or play, it's just very solid.The whole thing weighs in at 3 lb 9 oz. not counting the power adapter.KeyboardThe keyboard layout is comfortable and doesn't have any unusual key placement or size.  This may not seem noteworthy if you've never used a laptop that did something strange with the keyboard (I'm looking at you Lenovo), but trust me, it matters.Another nice thing about a fairly standardized keyboard layout is the ready availability of keyboard covers.  Although this model is not specifically listed as compatible, this cover fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KKYXXR.  I've had more than one device saved by silicone keyboard covers like this and I strongly recommend them for anyone buying one of these. (I'm not recommending any cover specifically, merely providing an example of one that perfectly fits.  This way you can take the model numbers from that listing and look for others if you like)The keys themselves are well-designed low-profile keys. They're quiet and responsive.  I don't have any problems with bounce and the (mostly) full-width keys are still comfortable under my large hands.The keyboard backlight is very well designed.  Each of the keys including its alternate function (punction etc...) are illuminated cleanly.  There are three backlight levels, though I find the lower intensity unnecessary as the default setting is bright enough to see in a brightly lit room and not overpowering in a dark room.TouchpadThe touchpad is basically standard fare.  It's designed well enough that I didn't find myself accidentally moving the mouse pointer while typing.  Though I still prefer a USB mouse, the touchpad is very serviceable.DisplayThe screen is extremely glossy and will reflect absolute anything remotely bright behind you.  It's not terribly noticeable when you're working with bright/white content on the screen - such as in a word processor or reading most web pages, but when there is darker content on the screen as often happens when watching videos it's surface becomes like a mirror.  That didn't seem like a good design choice to me but maybe having a mirror finish is necessary because it's a touch-screen?The edge-lit IPS does offer a bright and clear image, though it's not as bright as I would like.  Since I don't have a reliable method for measuring nits my evaluation of its brightness is going to be subjective. In summer noontime daylight it's noticeably dimmer than other 300 nit screens I have tested, though it is still somewhat readable if you stay in the shade so I would guestimate it's brightness between 230 and 250 nits.  I would consider this screen as being mostly for indoor use though, as I said, it is marginally usable outdoors on a sunny day provided you have ample shade.  If used in a darker environment the screen is bright but does suffer from typical LCD uniformity problems (see the image of a blank screen attached to this review).The refresh rate of the display seems to be locked at 59Hz.  Being an IPS screen it has very fast switching so it passed the blur-busters tests just fine - motion blur is all but non-existent making it great for watching video.The capacitive touch screen is very responsive and feels accurate even with my giant fingers.  I don't have a stylus to test so I can't comment on compatibility or accuracy of that.Real-Life Windows 10 (Not S Mode!)A lot of this 2-in-1 style of laptop come with an operating system called “Windows 10 Home in S Mode”.  “S Mode” is a highly limited implementation of Windows 10 that only allows you to use the Edge browser and only allows you to run software from the Microsoft App Store.  The inclusion of “S Mode” rather than a real-life Windows 10 is usually an indication that the vendor was not confident that the hardware provided would actually be able to run Windows 10.  Thankfully this laptop comes with a fully enabled implementation of Windows 10 Home and in my testing it performed just fine.Included SoftwareWhat would setting up a new machine be without going through and removing all of the pre-loaded garbage vendors always like to cram in?  This machine comes with a pretty standard complement of bloatware, “free trial” and offer software.  In case those terms don't mean anything to you, it basically referrs to apps that are more about getting you on the hook for paying fees for services than they are about increasing your productivity.Some of the trialware/offerware is built in to Windows 10 itself, some of it comes from HP.  I can't really provide a comprehensive list of what I think you should immediately remove from this laptop upon powering it up, but I will recommend two that you should immediately get rid of.  First is McAfee LiveSafe which is a waste of space that will soak up resources without actually protecting your computer then expire in a year or six months or whenever and beg for more money.  Just uninstall it and reboot – your machine will automatically switch to the built-in Windows Defender anti-malware which is free with Windows, won't kill your battery and actually does a much better job stopping and cleaning malware.  The second thing I recommend you immediately get rid of is “WildTangent Games”.  You'll need to remove both the “App” and the installed program to get rid of it entirely.  I'm deeply disappointed that HP thinks so little of its customers that it would ship this machine with WildTangent Games pre-installed.  During my days as a PC tech WildTangent Games were a universally despised vehicle for spyware.There were quite a few other things I removed right away like Express VPN, Dropbox Offer, Microsoft Office etc... If you don't remove these they will periodically pop up and annoy you by either trying to talk you or scare you into signing up for new services.  If you want cloud-based backup signing up for a Microsoft Account gets you some free “OneDrive” space and if you need more it's worth paying for it – you don't need both Dropbox and OneDrive. The Microsoft Office stuff gives you minimal access to Microsoft Word and tries to get you to sign up for paid services to get the rest.  I switched to OpenOffice years ago and have never looked back.  If you need a VPN service and don't already have one, I suggest you shop around a little rather than just go for Express VPN.  But I digress.  I strongly recommend you go through the installed “Apps” and remove anything that says “Offer” next to it.Convertible / 2-in-1 featuresThe ability to use the “convertible” features was the thing that most attracted me to this machine.  I enjoy watching movies without having to be tethered to any particular room (and when traveling)Laptop ModeIn laptop mode this is just like any other slim-line laptop.  This configuration offers the best/clearest sound as the speakers fire up from the far side of the keyboard, and the best overall ergonomics.Tent ModeIn Tent Mode the laptop is folded into an upside-down V shape and propped up on a surface.  This is by far my favorite mode for watching movies and TV with this machine, but it does come with extra considerations.  In this mode the speakers are pointed away from you, though in my testing I was still able to hear things just fine.  It would have been nice if they had included some silicone or rubber bumpers on the edge to keep the laptop from slipping or to keep rough surfaces from scuffing up the edge of laptop itself.Tablet ModeTablet mode is a bit of a mixed bag.  Essentially you fold the laptop closed backwards with the keyboard and screen on the outside.  The keyboard is disabled in this mode.  While you can use this laptop sort of like you would a tablet, its extra bulk is a definite factor.  The larger difficulty I had, however, was in holding it in a way that did not result in accidentally activating some control or scrolling to the bottom of a page because my fingers tickled the edge of the touch screen.  Switching to ""Tablet Mode"" in Windows 10 did very little to alleviate this.  Also in tablet mode it's difficult to adjust the screen brightness or volume.  I think this mode would be much better if they would provide volume and brightness controls on the edge of the machine and some software adjustment to move controls away from the edges where you're likely to accidently activate them while just trying to hold the ""tablet"" in place.SpeakersMuch is made of the ""Audio by Bang and Olufsen"".  For such small speakers they do sound remarkably clear and present a wider dynamic range than I would expect, but that being said don't expect miracles.  I had to max out the volume in a couple of instances while watching shows in tent mode and even then it did not sound particularly loud.Battery LifeWithout trying to apply any scientific process to judge battery life, I noted while using it that I was able to get about 4-5 hours out of a charge when just browsing the web, watching the occasional YouTube video and writing in a word processor.  It was only about 2.5 to 3 hours while watching Netflix or other videos at full brightness.  At 3470mAh the capacity isn't terribly impressive, but for such a lightweight system it seems just right.WiFi speedThe multi-function Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in one chip provided with this laptop provides thoroughly average performance.  In practice I was able to get transfer speeds of almost 10MB/s (Bytes not bits), which is more than enough for most day-to day activities, but doesn't come close to the performance tuned chips in some of the other laptops I've reviewed, some of which were able to more than double that throughput.  Again, I don't consider this a drawback because it provides perfectly adequate performance for general purpose computing.Webcam / MicrophoneThe built in webcam is very generic with a 720x1280 sensor.  Like most generic webcams, it has a very low ISO sensitivity and therefore requires a decent amount of ambient light to show a clear picture.  In a darker environment the image becomes grainy and video smears as the camera tries to compensate for low light.  I wouldn't try to record for YouTube on it, but it's perfectly serviceable for web conferencing as long as you're in a well-lit room.The built-in microphone on the other hand actually sounds pretty good, picking up voice clean and clear.  The documentation doesn't say for sure, but it's possible the mic was also designed by B&O. In any case I think they did a terrific job for a built-in mic.StorageOne of the things I look for in a laptop is the ability to upgrade the primary storage.  In general if you see ""eMMC"" listed on the description it means that the primary storage (i.e. hard drive) is soldered in and is generally more trouble than it's worth to swap out.  I'm happy to report that this laptop actually has full M.2 NVMe SSD which can, if the need arises, be replaced with a larger capacity drive, though the 512GB drive it ships with is plenty big for my needs. This laptop was clearly not designed to be upgraded or serviced by end users as evidenced by how annoying they made it to take apart, but once I had the back off it looks like it was designed to incorporate a full SATA SSD as well with a spot carved out under the right palm rest and an unpopulated ribbon socket labeled ""HDD1"".  I could not find any documentation on this (as of the time of this review), so I'm not sure if it's an either-or where you have to pick one or the other or if you can use both a SATA and M.2 drive at the same time. I was unable to test this because I don't have the proprietary adapter to connect the drive to the board.The supplied 512GB NVMe drive perfomed adequately but maxed out at ~1GB/s writes and  ~1.5GB/s reads.  This is somewhat normal for a budget drive but about half the potential of the NVMe spec.  As it would have involved re-installing Windows 10, I did not wish to try out a faster NVMe drive to see if the limitation lies with the drive itself or the controller.  Since you're not going to be gaming on this laptop, the drive speeds are absolutely fine.CPU/GPU Performance / ThrottlingSo does this laptop throttle the CPU?  While my default is to assume that it throttles the CPU/GPU until proven otherwise, most of my attempts to verify one way or the other have been stymied by the unavailability of system hooks used by the Intel XTU (which flat out refuses to install) or MSI Afterburner (installs but can't actually see anything). With a base frequency of 1GHz the machine runs pretty cool most of the time.  The fan isn't really capable of moving much heat so I seriously doubt that you will ever see a ""burst"" to 3.6GHz, but again unless you're trying to game on this machine that's largely immaterial.In my testing what games I was able to get running ran reasonably well at medium to high settings - older games ran fine at high settings, newer ones needed to be dialed back.  Even though this isn't a gaming machine it's a good indication of what its capable of.I had no trouble editing large images with GIMP, including computationally complex operations such as perspective shift and de-noise algorithms.The full-sized HDMI port makes it easy to connect a second monitor up to 4k@60 (it will default to 4k@30, but can be switched to 60Hz and in my testing works without any issues).  Likewise it was able to render web pages and video in 4K just as smoothly as it did in 1080p.GamingThis isn't a gaming laptop – which is probably obvious to anyone reading this, but even the most businesslike user may be tempted to dabble now and again.  I had considerable trouble getting games to run reliably on this.  Most titles crashed to desktop after one to five minutes without so much as a helpful error message.  What I did have some luck with were older titles like BioShock, Deus Ex Human Revolution etc...Watching VideoFor video playback I tested a variety of scenarios.  Playback of H265 10-bit 4K (HDMI Outputs 4K) content was basically smooth and flawless as was Blu-ray playback via VLC and libaacs. Both YouTube and Netflix had occasional stuttering on 1080p content but I'm being very nit-picky.  If I was not paying specific attention to how smooth playback was I would probably not have noticed.Miscellaneous- Unfortunately the 14-dh2011nr doesn't support Power Delivery which means that it can't be charged via the USB-C port like some of the higher-end x360's can.  In my opinion this is a huge missed opportunity as the ability to charge via USB-C makes it easier to purchase extra power adapters (one for home one for the office, etc...) and opens up the possibility of extending runtime while traveling by using a large power bank that supports PD.- Had to use compatibility mode to get certain apps (OpenOffice) to properly scale fonts etc... This is generally caused by the display drivers not being full featured enough to support the DPI mode being set from the app.- Like most laptop power adapters, there is no obvious way to wrap the cord to minimize the space it takes up inside your bag.- The USB ports had no trouble delivering enough power to power external spinning hard drives and optical drives without needing to use a second power source. This also means that if you use this laptop's ports to charge other devices over USB they may charge faster if the device is designed to take advantage of higher-amperage power sources.Conclusion:The 14-dh2011nr isn't the most powerful, doesn't have the brightest screen, isn't the fastest, but it has all around great features and performance for this price range.  It's perfect for surfing the web, web conferencing, editing photos, and watching movies or shows.  It's one of the best priced 2-in-1 laptops I've seen that's capable of running full-blown Windows 10 Home and doesn't feel sluggish in the slightest.  It's quiet, has good battery life, lightweight and an all around pleasure to use.  In short it's exactly what I was looking for.Pros:- Lightweight and thin- Full-sized standard keyboard (compatible with available keyboard covers)- Full-sized HDMI socket - supports 4K@60 just fine- Full Windows 10 Home (NOT ""S Mode"")- Good battery life- Convertable has great options for watching video or working without a keyboard- Quiet fan - even going full blast it's barely above a whisper- Decent amount of storage - 512GB- Legit M.2 drive (so it's upgradeable)- Great built-in mic- The full-sized USB 3.0 ports deliver enough amperage to support power-hungry devices like external hard drives and external DVD/Blu-ray drivesCons:- Shiny reflective screen surface can be really distracting  (mostly during dark scenes in videos)- No ""bumpers"" or rubber feet to protect the edge and stop slipping in Tent Mode- Screen is only around ~240 nits makes it only marginally usable in daylight - this is really an indoor screen- Pre-loaded with bloatware/nagware software including the spyware ""WildTangent Games""Neutral Observations:- Can't really game on it (newer titles seem to run okay but almost all of them crash out in the first minute)- Tablet mode is novel but difficult to use because controls are on the edge where you're holding your fingers- The GPU is extremely basic and lacks any options for monitoring- The CPU lacks the normal system hooks for monitoring

  After two weeks of use, I like the feel and action of the keyboard and that it is lighted. Everyday light computing will not tax this machine but I am not sure how it would be for gaming or intensive graphic manipulation. Battery life is less than 3-4 hours of light computing. I'm not sure I'll keep this machine, mostly because of the battery life and feeling unsure of whether it truly has DDR 4 ram.

  The first one I received quickly locked up and prevented downloading items from Microsoft store or even windows updates.  No matter what I tried, it would not work right.  During discussions with Amazon to return item, It was recommended that I try another one.  I did and that one has worked really, really well.  The start up time is pronominal, everything seems to work very well except for the battery life.  It goes quickly.  However, I am so happy with the rest of the laptop that I have chosen to ignore the number of times I have to hook up to charge.  Overall, it's a very good laptop which I did not think I would say based on the first one I got.  I gave it four stars because of all the problems with the first laptop.

Screen size is good - can use stand-alone (when I travel) but add larger screen at home for second screen.  Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.  I am not a Google fan so the Microsoft suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) work fine for me - although Edge I am not crazy about.  Google and other aps work fine.I only gave 4 stars as every new computer set up is a pain.  Dell has been a reliable partner of mine for years.

  As expected. It is fantastic! Light weight and well made. It performs smooth and quietly. We just needed a laptop for day to day office work and we had a small budget. The price was unbelievable and the performance has my two tombs up. The delivery was made way ahead of time, the package was well wrapped and padded. Wow! Thank you.

  I am very happy with the laptop. Since all of the wireless mouse, that I have gotten, were not a success, it was great to find that, all I need use is a finger. Plus, it does have USB 2.0 (socket) that allows me to my corded mouse, and my printer.

  The Dell model 3583 is specified (Dell Specs p.12) with an 8th generation Intel core i3, i5, or i7 CPU. I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD.  That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream! In addition - 3583 comes spec'd with Win 10 Home (not S mode). S mode sucks and the time it takes to dump it is a pain. 2cts.

  After conducting research, I chose this laptop for my business purposes: both running day to day online operations, but more importantly powerful enough to use in 3D modeling for new development of physical products and additive manufacturing.The machine arrived quickly, but I should have expected something to be wrong when I noted there was no packaging material in the shipping box.  I opened the interior package containing the laptop and the factory packaging appeared undamaged as well as reasonably robust.Then I began the process of starting up my new device.  In the middle of the screen the system was clearly having problems.  Note the attached pictures.  I went went to the manufacturer's website and made sure the latest drivers were downloaded and installed.  I conducted the manufacturers online tests and this did not remedy the issue.  Sadly I would have to return/replace this.Here is where it becomes absurd.  I drove to the Amazon store at Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree, Colorado.  I wanted to expedite the return process, and I conceived of Amazon being interested in getting a replacement to me quickly.  I offered to come back to this location the next day if they could replace it quickly.  They would not be able to replace it quickly. Not only was this not possible (and I may have been too hopeful for this outcome) the Amazon store would NOT accept the return at the location.  Instead I was required to drive to a UPS store to make the return.Along with this laptop I ordered a laptop fan to aid in keeping the device cool and performing well.  Since I was not keeping the laptop I returned this item right there at the Amazon store.  However, I was not allowed to turn return this broken laptop costing over $2000 in the same location.  This makes NO SENSE.  Why would a company that sold a product require the customer to use more third parties rather than its own agent/location in order to return it?  The customer service person on-site had no explanation.I drove another 9 miles across town to the nearest UPS store.  Just before it closed.  I re-initiated the return process via my smart phone.  Instead of being providing a scan code to provide to UPS... I was required to email myself, and the UPS store a copy of the shipping label, then pay the UPS store additional money to print Amazon's return label.The process was absurd.I was really looking forward to using this device as the online reviews (not necessarily Amazon's) led me to believe this was a great computer.  I do not know if the damaged screen was caused by shipment or a factory flaw.I do know that Amazon made this process difficult.  I will now be waiting for ""7 days"" to get my refund issued, so that I can find a replacement and it will not be from Amazon.I will not be taking the risk of buying high-end electronics through Amazon again.  At this point it may be better to buy directly from the manufacturer or a local store.UPDATE:  Between Amazon's absurd return requirements, and UPS incompetence, my time and money were totally wasted.  After two weeks of waiting, worrying, tracking and nonsense, I still do not have my money back for a defective product.  DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.  They are the 21st Century version of ""The telephone company"".  Too big to care.

  I have always wanted an Alienware and was happy to choose this one. When it works, it works very well. It's also beautiful to look at.The problem is my PC crashes all the time - generally daily. I get the dumbest errors like Hard Drive - Not Installed. Dell support is useless. They try to funnel you to automated systems rather than humans and leave you wasting your time until you get frustrated and give up. It's almost like they're trying to frustrate you long enough with crappy tech support that your warranty expires before you recover your mental health.

  I gave 4 stars Cus its wrong description. As same as the first man who reviewed this item. the description didn’t match the description in terms of graphics, only a 2070 rather than a super! (Originally it showed 2070 super, now it changed) the laptop is good, but can be better. It can run most 3A game smoothly. The temperature of CPU runs as 76 degree centigrade, but it will not decrease frame rate. Cannot feel pretty hot on the keyboard. The other thing I have to mention that I paid $24XX for the laptop. However, it has $230 off discount now. Ready to return it in a few days! Already buy another one from Alienware website, which is 2080s. Generally, I like this laptop, and it can be better!

  First the big big pro is the weight is way lighter than the old 15r2 way less that is great, the only con on this is that there is no metal frame anywhere.So far I have noticed the temperature and fans action when installing some games and primarily with the battery charger plugged in. I have not yet evaluated the battery usage, I will prefer the dark one but this was with almost 400 usd discount so I took it. This does have the 2070 super inside as advertised. I will review some more in a couple of months. But alienware is my preferred gaming brand of laptops.Also this does not have SB audio card nether the Klipsch speakers it is a sad thing but how can you light weight ?

  What else can I say?  I did nothing more than run the suggested Windows/Dell updates and play World of Warcraft.  The machine ran the game very well, though it did run a bit hot as other mentioned.  I experienced the occasional screen-tearing, and some weird hangs where whatever applications were running would stutter for about a second.  This is already behavior I had not experienced in another laptop, but I mostly ignored it.Then the machine bricked.  Just shut down without warning and would not turn back on... sad.

  Fantastic product, handles everything you can throw at it with ease. Beautiful screen, keyboard is nice and responsive as well. Only concern is the heating. To play some high end games at max graphics quality it is imperative to have it on the full speed settings for fan. CPU temps even with this sometimes high north of 100 celcius. Recommend buying a cooling pad for extended gaming sessions. Otherwise, 10/10

  This is the slowest computer I have ever messed with. I literally recieved this 40 minutes ago and have gotten so many unresponsive pages and had to force close them. I thought it was my internet even though it is running as usual. I was able to do everything I needed on my other laptop before this one even loaded the page I needed to be on. Returning and going to buy another of my other laptop. The only upgrade on this is the touch screen. That is amazing. But not worth the hassle of being so slow.

  Why did I buy this?I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn’t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years.What I considered / compared it too?GPU – GTX 1650 – this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search.Processor – 9th gen i5 – I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that’s what I really valued most.NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo’s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that’s why I decided against that route.NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn’t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more.NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site.Monitor refresh – 60Hz – this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn’t pull the trigger on the extra costs.RAM – 8GB – documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost.NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn’t concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect.512gig SSD – I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today’s modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5” bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won’t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too.The Look – As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a “gaming” laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don’t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers.Keyboard backlight – has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision.Heat – this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn’t appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch.Battery life – I haven’t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in “economy” mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can’t plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours.Bloat – amazingly it didn’t come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that’s about it.What games do I play on it?No Man’s Sky Beyond – Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at allWoW – Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise)Overwatch – Ultra Settings with no issuesAs I play and test more games ill update this…..9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs.11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings.12/10/20 EDIT - Cyberpunk 2077 - played on Medium in game settings with no issues at all. prob could have bumped it up a setting.What about the backlight/bleeding reports?Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don’t.  I get that everyone has defects and a % of DOA product.  Everyone’s mileage will differ on this I guess.

  Because this computer, was seriously great while I had it up and operational. I thought it was my dream laptop like the other users have said. Unfortunately, barely a week into use, my laptop froze up on me while I was browsing the internet, I forced shut it down, and it never turned back on. Did every fix in the book for hours on end but nothing worked.Now, I have to return it. I'm very disappointed, I've never had a laptop cut out on me so fast in all the years I've had laptops.

  First off, performance on this laptop is great. The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C.I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the ""gamer"" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice.The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers.Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others.

  Overall decent laptop for the $700 range, you get what you paid for.Battery life is ok if you put everything to lowest. The single channel RAM is a turn off, if this was a double RAM channel then it would be a 5/5.

  Okay, so I will begin by saying that I was hesitant to buy a computer from online that I hadn’t seen and with limited ratings. First off, don’t just look at the stars for ratings, read the commentary as well. I know one person had given this purchase an unsatisfactory review because it was not the touch bar version he/she had hoped for...I find it to be the responsibility of the consumer to read and know what they are buying. Unless the transparency of this advertisement was changed, I think it is clear to see that this is a 15inch MacBook retina computer that’s being sold. That being said, I have been 100% satisfied with this purchase. The ability to add on the protection plan (accidentals included!) has given me a piece of mind, and rivals in store offers for protection plans on new computers. This laptop is in pristine condition and communication from the seller is timely. First a little background: I am a graduate student who needed a functional, fast computer with quite a bit of storage. I do not game so I was unable to provide a review for that function. Onward, the item came WELL packaged in a generic box and this heavy duty air type casing that probably could protect it from a pretty significant drop. That was one of the main things I was worried about, just because I know the term “fragile” stamped on the side of the box does not ensure your package will not be tossed around. It arrived via FedEx—you will need to provide a signature for it, so please be sure someone is home to receive it. The receipt, a couple of advertisement papers, the computer and the charger came in the box. To be entirely transparent, the extender for the charger is not included in this package, but the charger was wrapped in form fitting plastic just as you would purchase it from the store and it is 100% functional. The screen looks amazing and it literally feels new when you open it. a protection layer comes in between the keyboard and screen, just as it does on a new MacBook. The hinge isn’t worn out or loosened like it had been open and closed for 5 years; it feels NEW. Underneath had all the black foot tabs in place and they are tight. I will say that there were a few HAIRLINE, VERY SUPERFICIAL scratches. They are all on the underneath the computer; the top and sides are cosmetically flawless. The scratches are unnoticeable and don’t bother me a bit. LITERALLY, hairline and about 2-3 inches in length. This isn’t anything you would notice even in a picture because they are the same color as the computer. It’s hard to explain, but I had to place the computer upside down in the window (during the day time of course) to even see them. To me, they aren’t even worth mentioning but I wanted to provide an honest review for anyone thinking about purchasing this computer. Lastly, my decision was made from the recent release from Consumer Report’s laptop edition. Price was not an issue for me, so I didn’t seek out something within a certain range; I just wanted the best and something that would accommodate my needs (ports, storage, etc). So do your research from credible sources and pay attention to exact model numbers, not just brands and general models. I am not a hardcore Apple fan either, so I am not influenced by brand. In fact, I had recently purchased the newest windows surface book (I think that’s the name...it’s the detachable one) and I’m much happier with this overall. But then again, I was not adamant about having a tablet or touchscreen. I mean, you should know what you are walking in to with any computer you buy as a customer. I am so happy with this purchase. After looking online at several vendors, no other came close to the quality, size, and storage this one had. And as I mentioned previously, I recommend purchasing the warrenty with it for an added piece of mind. Also, it’s nice knowing Amazon backs this purchase. There are other third party vendors that are not certified so if a problem is encountered, you are relying on their integrity to address it, which can be hit or miss. This is why I chose this vendor over a couple others I saw selling this version of computer. I hope this helps someone. If any changes occur, I will come back and update this review. But honestly, if you are looking for functionality and are not swayed by the trends or okay with having an older Apple computer, this vendor/purchase is the way to go.

  The computer works great, new screen. very little unnoticeable scratches. I'm giving 4 stars because the seller claimed the computer had a new battery with 0 cycles. However the battery has 235 cycles on it and holds 85% of the original charge. the capacity is 15% lower.

  This is the second laptop received as “renewed” condition.  These laptops came with third party remote management software installed that requires a user ID and password from Trip Advisor Managing Agent that, if you actually had one, would allow them to setup and manage the software and files on your laptop.  According to Apple tech sit here is no way to get around this and it should be returned.  Very time consuming and still no working laptop!

  All I can say is that I will buy refurbished equipment from this seller in the future.  The MacBook Pro I ordered was in such good shape and arrived in working order.  My daughter absolutely loves it.  If you need a Apple laptop but don't want to pay the exorbitant price for a new one, you need to check out this seller.  Great support!  Great value!

  I was skeptical about getting a used computer on Amazon for seeing all the bad reviews, but this is great! Computer is fast, screen is great to look at, and works wonders. I'm a photographer and got it specifically for working with Adobe products. It's from a good apple era as well, when they made useful computers. Has an SD slot, HDMI, 2 usb slots and charging ports. If I had any complaints, it would be that there's a small scratch on the back of the screen (nothing that interferes with the usage) and the trackpad is just a little stiff. I still recommend if you want a good quality computer on a budget.

  This is the most honest review I can give, no intention to purposefully hurt the seller or Amazon Renewed...Cons:1. When they say renewed to be ""like-new"", DEFINITELY take this with a grain of salt. My product came with several scratches, the edges of the metal casing were worn, and all the open crevasses were either dusty (like an actually dust ball) or had some kind of yellow crust on it.2. There were about ten keyboard keys central on the MacBook, whose back-lights did not function at all or were so dim as to not adjust with the keyboard light settings.3. The MacBook was apparently not reset properly because it was locked by a TripAdvisor Remote Management software, which would require an account to login and actually access the computer.4. Platinum Deals customer service responded quickly, but after the first email it took a whole day to receive another response (unless it was Friday then they waited until Monday). This was a bit frustrating to deal with.Pros:1. Customer service from Platinum Deals was very kind and tried to help.2. Customer service from Amazon was very kind and tried to help.3. Since I was unable to get a replacement, I was given a refund and will have to look for this laptop elsewhere.OVERALL: the laptop was more in a ""like-used"" condition so definitely inspect the product and take pictures of the condition you received it in. Even though it says Amazon Renewed... be skeptical and do your own product check to make sure it satisfactorily matches your expectations. Amazon usually can be trusted for quality (in my experiences) but this definitely means that their Renewed program is not foolproof..

"Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB SSD - Platinum",NA,5.0,"
  Didn't want to wait two days so I went brick and motor to buy this today. Laptop manufacturers take note, THIS is how you do a cost down version of a premium product. I got the 128Gb model and I would highly recommend not getting the $550 unless that's the absolute limit on what you can spend.Lets start with the screen. Despite the resolution hit compared to the Surface Laptop 3 this screen STILL looks amazing. Nice colors, the 3:2 aspect ratio is REALLY nice and I really wish laptop manufacturers would get the picture already and make 3:2 computers already for people that work more than they watch YouTube videos, and while it can't use the Surface Pen with this screen I think Microsoft thought that if you really need to buy a $140 pen you can probably afford the Surface Laptop 3. I kinda agree since this laptop doesn't really target the high end crowd, it's more of a budget computer.Keyboard feels great! The keys aren't mushy and they're also not obnoxiously loud. Just the right balance of noise to feel. Bad news though, the keyboard isn't backlit. Somewhat understandable since they need to get that advertised long battery life and backlit keyboards do suck a lot of power over time. They keys feel nice and evenly spaced out. No short shift nonsense although Tab is a little smaller but that's fine. The fingerprint windows hello is really nice and way quicker than the one on my phone too.It does run a little hot when on the lap but not uncomfortably hot. And it only gets loud when I'm basically torture testing the thing. Otherwise for video chat or writing things or general browsing and light work it's nice and quiet. Also unless you have the $550 version turn the Windows S mode off immediately. No offense to Microsoft but the Windows Store sucks.My only real complaint is that I really wish there was an Alcantara variant. I love the soft feel of the Alcantara keyboards the few times I've used the more premium devices. Otherwise I would highly recommend people get the $700 version.

"Microsoft Surface Laptop Go - 12.4"" Touchscreen - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 128GB SSD - Platinum",NA,4.0,"
  Recently, I bought the 8GB/128GB version of the Surface Laptop Go. It's been a great purchase so far, but there are some quirks and annoyances sprinkled throughout its greatness. After using ThinkPads for years, the Surface Laptop Go combined with the Surface Dock 2 (and my usual peripherals) may have converted me.The positives:-Build quality (wonderful, even the plastic bottom cover feels premium)-The screen (resolution and DPI are fine, great brightness levels and colors, I much prefer the 3:2 aspect ratio for web browsing and documents aside from ultra-wide spreadsheets)-Lightweight and very portable (12.4"" is the perfect form factor for my needs)-Works great with the Surface Dock 2 (has replaced my Core i7 7700 desktop)-The keyboard is quite nice to type on-The trackpad feels great to use (not sure if it's mylar or glass, but it's wonderful)-The fingerprint sensor is quite nice for easy logins-Intel AX201 Wi-Fi card-RAM management is quite good on the 8GB models (I'm usually consuming 4-5GB)-UEFI/BIOS option to stop battery charging at 50% (perfect for my needs since I keep it connected to the Surface Dock 2 most of the time, this can easily be switched off)-No bloatware or junk programs out of the box (it's like the Microsoft/Windows version of using a Google Pixel phone)-I was able to upgrade my Laptop Go to Windows 10 Pro, so now I'm getting the full Windows 10 experience I'm used to-Surface devices have decent value retention (even broken older models go for decent prices on auction sites)The negatives:-Ships with S mode enabled by default (easy to turn this off, but it's annoying)-The keyboard isn't backlit (not a deal-breaker, but an annoyance in 2020)-The fan is loud when it ramps up, but it's usually fairly quiet (changing power modes helps)-There's no micro SD card slot (would be nice for storing music/movies or local file backups)-The 4GB/64GB eMMC model exists-Decent but not amazing value for the money (leaves you wanting more features the higher-tier models have)-It's a modern laptop with soldered RAM and a DIY SSD upgrade will probably void the warranty-The 16GB RAM model isn't readily available for consumers-It doesn't come in black (but the Platinum color I have is quite nice)-I really miss having a TrackPoint style device on the keyboardAs you can see, I can think of far more positives than negatives. Most of my negatives are either preferences or problems with modern laptops in general rather than the Laptop Go itself. Although I was drooling over some refurbished ThinkPads before buying the Laptop Go, it was hard to say no to a few of its main positives (mainly the screen, the trackpad, and the 3:2 aspect ratio).For its current asking price, I can highly recommend the 8GB/128GB  model if you turn off S mode, don't need a lot of storage space, and don't plan on playing tons of AAA games on it.

  Note, there are 3 components of this REVISED review. The 1st regarding the product, the 2nd regarding the vendor. And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty.-----TL,DR: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. With a very low effort refurb process there appears to be a higher than average number of purchased units quickly failing, and the vendor fails to honor the warranty by providing false or misleading correspondence to warranty inquiries.-----1.) I admit I wasn't expecting much as far as the Chromebook itself. I was specifically looking for a decent, stable, used/refurb older Chromebook, modestly priced unit to use for testing, debugging, and experimentation in an educational environment. It is not my primary machine, so I didn't need it to be super snappy. This model is particularity geared towards the school/student market, so I figured it would be reliably sturdy. I was pleased to find that this unit was extremely clean, well functioning, and very speedy and responsive even beyond my basic needs. The only drawback of using an older refurb unit is battery performance. This one doesn't last very long, or hold a charge well. But I'm pretty proficient with this tech, and already knew that this battery design is only optimally rated for an approximate 18 month window, after which a steady decline in battery performance should be expected. It's just part of the territory. Replacing these batteries is not very complicated. Anyone considering a refurbished model that has more than a couple of years under it should consider doing the same. This unit (true to the model line in general) has sturdy, solid feel, a responsive and snappy keyboard, a clear bright screen, and nice audio.2.) As far as the vendor, I initially could not have been more satisfied. Not only was the price lower than I expected to have to pay for a modest refurb unit, but shipping was almost immediate, and FAST! I expected a 2-day shipment via Amazon Prime, but my delivery arrived less than 23 hours after placing the order. I don't live in an area where faster than 2-day service is typically an option, so this was an especially great surprise.--------HOWEVER.......3.) After less than two months of very sparse and careful use (a combined use of under 3 hours) the unit simply died, no longer booting up.After ensuring the battery was fully charged I applied the 3-key reset method (esc-refresh-pwr) and the screen flickered the ""Chrome OS is missing...."" message before pixelating into random lines and colors, quickly seizing up. Repeated attempts produced the same results.Being proficient with this tech (I am a Chromebook administrator on a school site) it was quickly evident the unit was suffering logic board failure. Presuming that any tech support will still want to go through all the paces, I still proceeded with an attempt to freshly install Chrome OS, but it continued to freeze, flicker and pixelate upon any attempt to boot up. A call into Amazon's tech support to isolate symptoms confirmed my diagnosis of logic board failure. This is despite having very light use of this unit for less than a total of 3 hours since purchase. I was not worried as the unit has died well within the vendor's 90-day warranty, and after having been so thoroughly surprised by their very speedy purchase fulfillment, I fully expected them to honor that warranty. However the several communications I have had with this vendor have produced confusing responses with no indication thus far that they will honor the warranty and replace the unit or refund the purchase.I initially notified the vendor regarding the failure of the unit, and hoped to elicit information about their warranty coverage. I also attached the transcript of the chat with Amazon's tech support identifying logic board failure. Their response was the following:""Your message has been assigned to me, and I am reviewing it as a high priority. I will follow up with you very soon. Blazing Prices is committed to your satisfaction, and I will make every effort to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. Thanks for choosing Blazing Prices!""Have a great day!Thank you,Blazing Prizes""That is all good and well, but I took note that their response did not include an actual service representative's name to correspond with the noted ""me"" in their response. An actual contact person is usually identified in context of following a ticket through a tech support chain. This was an early indicator of a pat automated response.Two days later I received a followup email that appeared similarly automated, but with the additional note that I should contact the manufacturer for warranty assistance, stating that the manufacturer has been notified of my query and that they stand ready to assist me.Now, at this point I knew that the response was laughably suspect. Not only did they not provide any identifying contact information about whom (or how) to contact ""the manufacturer"", but I knew for a fact that this manufacturer (Dell in this case) was absolutely not poised to offer warranty assistance for a 3+ year old 2nd-hand low-end Chromebook. In short, Blazing Prices outright lied.I responded to their email about ""the manufacturer"" to see what they would say if I I asked for more information about following up with the manufacturer. I received the above-mentioned automated reply.I knew by then that I would get nowhere with the vendor. Still, I have continued to follow up with additional queries in the weeks following. As I post this I still have a few days left within the 90-day warranty period. But each response from the vendor has likewise mirrored the previously noted automated response.They are not necessarily a scammer. They sold me a product at what on the surface should have been a very competitive price. If it continued to function at least beyond the warranty period the vendor would have met their obligation decently. However it is clear by my experience, as well as those of other reviewers, that this vendor has falsified some of the claims on the product page. They certainly are not able to account for the integrity of the product  - and in such cases that is what gives a supposed 90-day warranty its value - but this vendor also has shown no indication that they will honor that warranty - so having added it to the product listing constitutes fraud.I already have a tech support ticket in to Amazon regarding this purchase, and am following up with them regarding Blazing Prices fraudulence in skirting their warranty obligation.Do not purchase from this vendor.

  At first I was very pleased with the computer, but after one month it started flickering on the screen. I contacted the seller who responded quickly.

  These Dell Chrome Books are really nice! We got them for our boys ages 13 and 11 for Christmas. They use them for homework and playing games! It’s one game that they really play that they can’t play on this chrome book because it doesn’t have windows. Rowblocks is the name of the game I think! Lol.... about two months after getting the books we noticed that they wouldn’t charge and they could only use them if they were plugged in. We contacted the company and sent them back and two weeks later they sent them out knew books. These are working great! Turns out the both of the books had bad battery packs. Customer service was great and I would definitely buy from them again!

  I’ve had this computer before and know it is a solid machine, but this refurbished computer arrived without being properly refurbished. The sound did not work from the speakers or the headphone jack. Amazon did everything they could to connect me with HP support, which went through a series of efforts to update the computer properly. In this, it was made clear that there were a ton of items not updated. It honestly seems like the seller either did the bare-minimum on the refurbish. If you take note of review dates, all of the one-Star reviews start in 2020, so I would suggest purchasing something new or still under warranty elsewhere to save yourself any hassle.

  Bought the computer because it was the same style as my work laptop and I already had a docking station for it. When I first got it the screen flickered  a couple of times but stopped. Then it started flickering more often. Now it won’t come on at all but it will power on and then go off. On or off the docking station or plugged in with power cable.

  This product is not worth the money. You could purchase it brand new on a different website for nearly the same price. The charger stopped working less than a month after receiving it.

  Laptop arrived immaculate like from the factory. No scratches or anything. Brand new battery (I ran some tests with some utilities ) and seems really solid. Ver nice unit.I decided to return it because I wanted a FHD screen (as in the specs) and it came with a HD screen so that was disappointing . But In the end it is not a big deal, many cannot tell the difference. Also It is not touchscreen but that was not in the specs so not expected.

  I was really skeptical buying a refurbished laptop.  I wanted the same laptop (for personal) that I have for work so it was easy to go between and work with my docking station.  This was more than half the price of new and I was afraid it was going to be old and klunky.  Truth is that it looks better than my year old work laptop.  The packaging was excellent and only a few blemishes on the top which were covered by a new matching skin.  The skin is the only negative feedback, it was torn on one corner and I really didn't care because I had already purchased a skin so I could tell it apart from my work laptop.  I immediately setup my laptop world and checked all external connections and audio and everything is working properly.  One plus that I wasn't expecting is the lighted keyboard and just the excellent feel for typing.  I am more than pleased and hope this laptop lasts me a long time.

  Works as expected. Loaded with Win Pro and can use the fingerprint reader with Windows Hello. The case had cosmetic scratches on it due to normal wear and tear.  Everything else is in good working order. Windows was fully licensed, but I did have to go through a few updates to get to the latest version. The lack of bloatware is nice too. Otherwise getting this refurbed laptop is way cheaper than a new one and works for most common needs like kids homework projects, office 365, browsing, etc.

  Revised: 05/29/21Laptop completely froze - non responsive keys, mouse, even Ctrl-Alt-Del non functional.Had to turn off and back on. All my windows were recovered at least, but this is concerning. Also noticed some periodic screen flickering.  I have not yet used this for any gaming or heavy duty processing - just emails and web surfing so far. About 30 hours usage since new.---Note there are 2 models - one with touchscreen, one without. The Galaxy Book Pro does not have a touchscreen. I currently have a laptop with a touchscreen and found I used this feature very rarely. It always seemed awkward on a laptop sized screen. I use my tablet when I want/need to use this capability. I've only had this Galaxy Book Pro a couple days, but so far am pleased with it. Amazing how light it is. And so far my downloads, internet work, and Office applications are performing better than any previous computer I've had (and I've had a lot.)  Screen is clear and bright. Sound is good. For my go to, everyday computing needs, I rate this 5 stars. I may even purchase one for my 90+ year old  Dad who spends much of his day web surfing. :)

  I did a lot of research before buying this laptop and I am extremely satisfied with it.  The only difficulty was with MS Windows needing to do a lot of updates before things stabilized but that is true for ANY new Windows PC.  Some of the online reviews had negative comments but I found them not to be a problem.  Here's some examples:  Some said the display was too dim but I felt that it was plenty bright in daylight or in a dim room.  Yes, there is some flexing in the keyboard but for normal typing it was not even noticeable.  The speakers, though not fantastic, I found to be better than I expected.  Granted that my previous HP laptop had up firing speakers which sounded better and the Samsung speakers are under the laptop body firing down but they sounded pretty good.  Based on the negative speaker reviews for the Samsung I was expecting the sound to be terrible but it was actually pretty good.  Another reviewer had problems with the Wi Fi speed he was getting but I ran a speed test and got the full speed I always get from my Wi Fi.The overall performance and graphics is very good and the light weight and size are excellent.  I had to wait a little longer to get the Mystic Silver but I really didn't want the blue one.  The wait was worth it!!

  The screen is amazing. Laptop.is extremely thin. Lightweight. Only con, is the the mousepad ""click"" is horribly loud and feels extremely cheap. Beautiful laptop. Very satisfied. Charges with USB type C 65w charger. Had a issue with the $100 gift card you're supposed to get but Amazon realized quickly.

  performance the best. but $1299 and its plastic + delicate.if I put it on my lap and I try to type in, sometime the mouse click just would happen  because of the pressure I put with my hands on the sides of ittwo flimsy two delicate and plastic for $1,300

  (5.20.2021)I feel I may need to update this review, for the 15.6"" Galaxy Pro i7, later at some point because currently I am not impressed.The display is nice, the laptop is lightweight and its performance seems to be quick - boot time is satisfyingly quick.It is the overall build quality that I am unimpressed with; the bottom of the laptop bows out a small bit.  Laptop body feels like cheap plastic - if you're purchasing this, get a protective sleeve for it.Samsung will be releasing a clear case for this at some point, but it currently is not available for purchasing.If you are not careful with how you pick up the laptop, the body can flex just enough to click the trackpad as if it were a mouse click.Only reason I may change my review is depending on the quality of productivity-levels I can get to with this as well as using a Samsung Galaxy S7+ to operate as the second monitor for the laptop.
