  Shipped to me in Canada with no problem, didn't mention that it would be an American machine and now I'm unable to renew or upgrade my warranty or purchase ANY services through Lenovo for my laptop because I don't have an American Credit card to buy it with and it won't let me purchase through the Canadian site because the machine was made in America. Lenovo support has been unable to figure out away around the issue. Very unhappy with Amazon and Lenovo.

  The screen resolution was nothing short of horrible.  But this seller is simply my worse experience on Amazon and is a ripoff.  I wanted to like this product!  But, I paid almost $400 for this piece of junk and was refunded only $221.  STAY AWAY!!!!

  I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 13.5” Touch-Screen – AMD Ryzen 5 Surface Edition - 8GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive (Latest Model) - Platinum,NA,"
  Generally speaking, I'm pretty positive when it comes to the Microsoft Surface line, going back to the Surface 4, original Surface Book, and first generation Surface Laptop. Except for the Surface Laptop, the Surface line is kind of a series of niche products that are good at what they're intended for, and it usually makes comparisons difficult.The Surface Laptop series has been tweaked and refined enough by this new 4th generation that I'm mostly comfortable comparing it to the MacBook Air. In fact, were it not for Apple switching to their own processors, I'd consider this a direct competitor. (More on that in a bit.)In terms of build quality, Microsoft has outdone themselves. The SL 4 is flawless. No rough edges at all, no creaks, no wobbles, and seams that you need to really hunt for if you're looking for a tactile complaint. The 3:2 display is beautiful, bright, and visible at any reasonable angle. Despite being glossy, I've seen current matte displays from other manufacturers that show more glare and reflection. The unit itself is light, and feels incredibly solid when closed. The touch screen, not surprisingly, is as good as you'll find in a laptop. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing much with a pen (the Surface Pro or Book series is really meant for that) my older Surface Pen worked just fine with the SL 4.One of the things I look for whenever I'm about to compare something to a MacBook Air or Pro is sound quality. Apple laptops are legendary when it comes to sound quality, and while the front-firing speakers on Surface Book laptops are great, very little out there matches Apple. But I really think Microsoft has finally done it with the SL 4. I don't say that lightly. I spent a good hour going through everything from Chvrches to Dvorak. The sound is loud, crisp, and sacrifices nothing on highs, mids, or lows. It's also the first laptop I've ever used where Dolby Atmos (enabled by default) produced such distinct spatial separation that I was holding the laptop around my ear to figure out where the physical speakers were.Beautiful display, almost unparalleled sound, but what about typing? To me, Lenovo ThinkPads are the benchmark here. Nothing I've owned -- Apple, Dell, HP, Razer, Surface series... nothing tops a ThinkPad. And... well... that's still true. The SL 4 isn't going to give you a ThinkPad-caliber keyboard. It is, however, very, very good. Definitely superior to the current-gen Dell XPS 13, HP Envy 13, and yes, MacBook Air. Where previous generations felt more like the Surface Pro keyboards than they should have, the SL 4 keys are firm, with good travel. The point of possible contention here is the Alcantara top, similar to the Surface Pro keyboards. If you haven't experienced it, it might feel weird on the wrist rests. I'm used to it and find it to be infinitely more comfortable than the hard edge of an XPS 13 or Envy (though I don't mind the ThinkPad Yoga or MacBook Air edges at all). In saying that though, I do find myself being much more careful with the SL keyboards. A couple drops of coffee on most laptops will wipe off. On Alcantara, you'll have a perpetual reminder of the day you were a bit too cavalier with your coffee.The trackpad is perfect. Perfect size, perfect placement. Outstanding accuracy and palm rejection. Nothing really new here, given Microsoft's history of great trackpads. Notably, the integrated camera seems to be a huge improvement over any Surface product I've seen, including the Surface Book 3. Windows Hello's acquisition time is impressively fast now, and performance in Zoom and Teams is probably toward the higher end of what I've seen in integrated cameras.Getting into performance, well... it's an i5 with only 8 gigs. The i5 is good enough to outperform a high-end i7-8650U common in ultrabooks from 2-3 years ago. But not by leaps and bounds. I'm hesitant to lump this in with ""Well, you can use Office and browse the web"" laptops, because the CPU can do way more than that, but the 8 gig ceiling is something you're going to feel once you get a bunch of tabs open and then decide you want to edit some photos in Photoshop. For what RAM costs lately, I'm a bit disappointed that 16 gigs isn't the starting point for all but value-priced Windows laptops in 2021.With that processor comes a bit of heat. Not ""I can't wear shorts, because this will burn me"" heat, but something as simple as the initial run of Windows Update was enough to get the fans (or maybe just one fan) on max speed after 5 - 10 minutes. In normal usage, I didn't notice any fan noise until I started pushing it with 20 Chrome tabs and Spotify open while actively tinkering with a RAW file in Photoshop 2021.Microsoft was stingy on ports, and they're sticking to their Surface Connect port. So while the USB-C port is perfectly capable of charging the laptop, if you choose to use a USB-C charger instead of a Surface Connect charger, you're down to a single USB-A port and the Surface Connect port for peripherals. Fortunately, the AC adapter is petite, and larger AC adapters will step down and work properly with the SL 4.Speaking of charging, battery life was decent. Not incredible, when you're using it with normal settings. At 80% brightness with Office, Chrome, and Spotify running and performance set at the midpoint, I don't think you'd get a full work day out of the SL 4. If you really backed down the brightness and set the performance to conserve battery power, you might be able to pull off a full day on a single charge. I don't think the claimed ""up to 17 hours"" is very realistic, but then, I can't name any manufacturer who has claimed a battery life that lines up with how people actually use their laptops.So at this point, the elephant in the room is the MacBook Air. If any laptop has more successfully gone toe-to-toe with the MBA, I haven't seen it. But... when it used to be ""If you like MacOS, get the Mac. Otherwise they're the same"" or even ""Get the Mac, because it can run Windows, too."" neither are quite as true anymore. The M1 processor in the MBA and the i5 in the SL4 aren't the same at all. Being platform agnostic, I wouldn't even begin to make excuses for how the i5 in the SL4 is absolutely smoked by the M1 in almost every aspect. It's faster, uses less power, produces less heat. But what it can't do (at least, today) is run Windows natively. Your only shot at running Windows on a current MBA is with Parallels doing processor emulation -- and in a lot of ways, that's kind of a throwback to the pre-Intel days of running Parallels on PowerPC Macs. There's a lot of ""Maybe..."" and ""Kind of..."" there, and performance isn't great.So, if you like, want, or need Windows and have coveted the MacBook Air, this is definitely for you. If you appreciate the 3:2 display ratio, this is probably for you. If you want a high-quality 13"" laptop, this is probably for you. But if you don't care whether you're using MacOS or Windows and want to squeeze every ounce of performance-per-dollar you can, I think the decision is probably a bit more difficult.

  I was hoping to switch from a Mac to the Surface laptop expecting Microsoft and PCs, in general, to have caught up to the technology and speed of a Mac. I was very disappointed. The keyboard was not comfortable to the touch, and the keys felt slight too far apart. The speed of downloading and installing a relative basic program was very slow. The trackpad was not nearly as convenient or responsive as that of my Mac despite having changed the sensitivity. I choose not to keep the Surface and have instead opted to stay with an updated Mac.

  Screen looks washed out. Tried adjusting in settings but nothing helped. Also, microphone doesn't work. It's needed for zoom meetings. Am returning it. Had bought another Dell for less money that had lit up keyboard and fingerprint security, but not a big enough HD. This one doesn't have either.
