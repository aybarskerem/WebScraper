"2020 Apple MacBook Air with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray",NA,"
  Perfeito como era de se esperar, com entrega a jato! Estava previsto pra chegar entre 27 e 30 de abril. Comprei dia 13 e chegou dia 15! Quanto ao computador não tenho nem o que dizer, já é meu terceiro MacBook Air, desde 2011 e ainda tenho os outros dois sendo usados pelos meus filhos, quase sem nenhum problema, que  mesmo quando aparecem são coisas pequenas e plenamente resolvidos pelas assistência técnica on-line, que tem os melhores atendentes que já vi na vida. O preço continua sendo alto demais para o Brasil, mas frente aos outros no mercado, vale cada centavo suado gasto. Esse modelo é ágil, tem como novidade touch para senhas e o teclado é maravilhoso. Super rápido o processador e a memória de 8Gb era o que faltava pra mim, pois dando aulas on-line uso muitos programas conectados ao mesmo tempo e meu MacBook antigo com 4Gb não estava conseguindo dar conta. Mas será perfeito pra minha filha que não usará poucos programas. Já era e continuo sendo fã total, melhores compras sempre são dos produtos Apple. Só queria ganhar melhor pra poder investir mais.

  The best laptop a 10 year old “gamer girl” could ask for! I’m blown away at how nice this laptop is, especially for the price.NOTE : External hard drive will need to be purchased separately though if you’re wanting to run more than two games on it, simply because it doesn’t have a large enough internal drive to run more than that.

  Recebi tudo certinho, só achei que a embalagem que foi enviado foi mal embalada, a caixa chegou com avarias (o produto estava intacto), veio amassada e rasgada, sei que nao tem nada a ver com o vendedor e sim com os correios, mas acho que o vendedor poderia ter embalado melhor, veio enrolada em uma camada de plastico bolha e só... e veio meio que solto dentro de caixa maior... entao quanto a embalagem precisa melhorar... mas o que interessa é o produto, chegou, tudo certinho! obrigado!

  Estuve buscando una buena laptop durante algunos meses, pero los precios (por lo que ofrecen) aquí en México están por los cielos. Después de buscar bien, encontré esta laptop vendida por Amazon USA por unos $12,500 pesos, y luego de informarme bien acerca de sus especificaciones y de lo que ofrecía, decidí que esta era la mejor opción debido a su coste-beneficio.La ordené el 28 de diciembre y la recibí varios días antes de la fecha prevista por Amazon (18 de enero), y aunque si tardó casi dos semanas, es comprensible ya que se atravesaban días festivos. El paquete llegó en buenas condiciones, aunque he de decir que lo recibí un poco más tarde de la hora estimada por Amazon; también cabe mencionar que la caja de la laptop venía un poco abierta (esto no es culpa de Amazon, sino de la Aduana), pero todo venía bien acomodado y en su lugar.Al encenderla, la laptop te va guiando para configurar Windows 10, pero al ser un producto de Estados Unidos todo el proceso será en inglés, aunque no supuso un problema para mi.En el apartado estético, tanto a la vista como al tacto, los materiales de construcción se sienten premium, como si de una laptop de más de $20,000 pesos estuviéramos hablando, teniendo un acabado en aluminio cepillado en la cubierta superior, y un acabado en plástico en el resto del equipo. Considerando el tamaño, el peso del dispositivo es bajo (en la publicación menciona que pesa alrededor de 1.8 kg, pero no sabría decir si es correcta o no la información), además de que es bastante delgada, pudiendo transportarla con facilidad hacia cualquier lugar.Un plus que trae, y que por lo general las demás laptops que rondan el precio no tienen, es el teclado retroiluminado, aunque eso sí, no tendrás la opción de dejarlo prendido todo el tiempo; si no lo usas se apagará solo, y cuando presiones alguna tecla se volverá a encender, o también podrás optar por apagarlo completamente.Esta laptop cuenta con el procesador AMD Ryzen 5 3500u y con gráficos integrados Radeon Vega 8, lo que hará que sea excelente para trabajos de ofimática con software como el de Office y sobre todo para tomar clases en línea (que es el motivo principal por el que opté por este equipo); así mismo podrá correr fácilmente con programas de productividad como Adobe Photoshop o Acrobat Dc.También cuenta con 8 GB de memoria Ram DDR4, y 256 GB SSD NVMe, el cual es uno de los mejores y más rápidos tipos de almacenamiento, lo que en conjunto con su procesador hará que el tiempo de carga de los programas sea mínimo y que no haya algún tipo de trabas (al encenderla tarda por lo general unos 6 segundos, y al abrir los programas un segundo o hasta menos).Pero cabe mencionar también que los 256 GB se quedarán muy cortos con el paso del tiempo, por lo que es recomendable agregarle otro disco duro, ya que trae un espacio para extra para hacerlo. Y así como con el disco duro, recomiendo agregarle otra memoria Ram (también trae espacio para agregársela) debido a que el sistema destina 2 GB para los gráficos, teniendo así únicamente 5.9 GB disponibles.Aunque no esté dedicada para gaming, puede correr sin problema con algunos juegos como LoL o Minecraft (pero para mejorar la experiencia es recomendable aumentar la Ram).La laptop tiene una pantalla Full HD 1080 de 15.6 pulgada, lo que hace que sea muy buena para consumir contenido como videos de Youtube o peliculas y series de Netflix.El sonido no es especialmente bueno; por lo general, lo suelo tener por encima del 60% de volumen, pero sinceramente por el precio no se le puede pedir mucho más.La duración de la batería es muy buena, pero depende del tipo de uso que le des. Por lo general a mi me suele durar de 7-9 horas en uso continuo desde el 100% de carga, navegando por internet y consumiendo Youtube. Se suele cargar en unas 2 horas.El único pero que puedo encontrarle a la laptop es que, al ser un dispositivo del 2019, no trae conector Usb-C, el cual cada vez es más indispensable. Además, el teclado viene en inglés y no trae la ñ, pero esto se puede solucionar cambiando el idioma, lo que no me supuso un verdadero problema.En general, la laptop es excelente por el precio en el que la encontré, que fue de $12,578 pesos ($10,441 pesos que costaba el equipo, y $2,137 pesos de la importación), y la recomiendo al 100% solo y únicamente si la encuentras vendida por Amazon USA a menos de $13,000 pesos, porque he visto que a veces que la venden por más de $20,000 pesos, y por ese precio te puedes comprar algo mejor; pero si la encuentras a un buen precio, recomendada al 100%

  Pretty happy so far after a month of use. I haven't had any problems with the heat, screens being brighter near the hinge, or the fan being loud, but people should be aware of those things before they think about using this for intense usage. I'd personally be careful about how you handle the hinge. The touchscreen itself is fantastic, switching from desktop to tablet mode in Windows is much easier than I expected. A HUGE plus for artists like me is that the pen works exactly like how you would expect other Wacom tablets to work (maybe not the fancier high end models, mind you), so this is a great entry way for people who are looking to get into digital art. You should market that more, Lenovo lol.There are only a few of shortcomings that I found so far. First, and a fairly small one, is that the battery isn't as great as they imply. I feel I'm only getting 6 hours on average, which isn't bad at all for a laptop, but no where near the 10 hours they proudly advertise. The colours on the screen are also not so great, and it isn't the best for brightly lit environments. I also wish there was a cover to snap on the keyboard while it's tablet mode, since I feel this would be something I want to use in tablet mode most of the time.One big issue unrelated to the actual product itself, however, is the warranty, which will be an absolute headache for whoever has to deal with that in Canada since we have to ship to the US, apparently. The warranty extension also isn't valid here, which is disappointing.Overall, I'm still having a good time using it as an art tool and for web browsing, but people here should be careful of the warranty issue and other small concerning aspects.

  The Celeron processor in this laptop is a dog. Very slow. Great concept, love the mix of laptop and touch screen, but the slowness of it is a real downer.We have the SAME model with the ARM processor in it, and it is noticeably snappier, though only slightly.

  I really like this computer, but the first one I received did not work properly.For my review of the working computer please skip to the following section. First I’m going to quickly outline some warning signs I found with the lemon laptop.- It wasn’t obvious at first, but over time the computer began to demonstrate more and more issues. First, it was recurring BSOD, especially on startup and shutdown. Then, the Bluetooth stopped working properly. Then I wasn’t able to open the start menu, or the settings, or the sound. The search feature within the Windows interface also broke. Overall it lasted about 2 weeks before it became unusable.- Amazon very generously replaced the laptop for me and the second works much better. In fact, the visual quality of the screen, the fingerprint reader, the responsiveness of the USB ports, all of which were issues with the first laptop, are much improved on all three fronts.I’ll just go quickly through some positives and negatives I’ve found with this laptop overall. Some of these are nitpicks but I wanted to draw your attention to some things other reviews haven’t really focused on.The Good- The price is great for what the market is like at the moment. Especially the size of the SSD is unusual for this price range and having a bit more space is definitely much appreciated.- The computer can run video games. If you’re a casual gamer, it’s powerful enough to play modern games, even if on some lowered settings.- It is so incredibly lightweight, and I personally think the design is quite attractive. Extremely portable, the charging cable is also very lightweight, but it sort of “snaps” into the computer port so it stays in place quite well.- The battery life is good, you might be able to get 7-8 hours on it if you’re not doing anything too demanding.- For a 14” keyboard, it’s very large and ergonomical.- The touchpad works very well.The Neutral- The fingerprint reader is okay but not great – on my lemon I would get into the computer using the reader maybe 1/10 of the time. On the one that works it lets me in maybe 7/10 login attempts.- The screen: there are contradictory accounts of how good the screen and colour quality on this computer is. First of all, before you assess yours, make sure you do all your Windows updates – the colours will improve after you’ve gone through the required and optional updates. On my lemon, the colours were slightly inaccurate, and the screen was overall too bright and lacked contrast, even after updates. On my second one the quality is just fine, so I think this is probably something that can vary computer to computer, which may account for the difference in assessments about how good the screen actually is throughout the reviews.[SEE PICTURES: left is the new laptop, middle is the lemon laptop, right is a Dell G3 laptop for reference]The Bad- The sound quality that comes out of the computer is not good. It’s very tinny and is not really acceptable for listening to movies or music. It also doesn’t get very loud on maximum volume. You’ll have to use a speaker to have decent sound quality and volume.- The backlighting on the keyboard goes off after 30 seconds. There is no way to change this.- There is no numerical pad (if this is something that’s important to you, keep in mind it’s not present here).- The headphone port can be finnicky in terms of getting the sound to come through properly.- The bluetooth cuts in and out sometimes.- Only 2 regular USB ports.Overall, it’s good for the price and I’m happy with it. I would recommend it, even if there’s a possibility you get a lemon. Amazon’s customer service is generally really great – I was able to replace the lemon within two days.** 4 MONTH UPDATE ** The laptop is still holding together well, though a couple of things have distinctly remained an issue.1. The power cord does not stick into the laptop plug as easily as it did at first - the cord can easily become dislodged from the laptop and it makes an obnoxious beeping noise whenever it's plugged in or removed.2. The bluetooth craps out a lot - streams and sound quality can stutter over the connection and this means this laptop's bluetooth capabilities, in my experience, are not particularly useable. In combination with the poor sound quality and volume, this makes it difficult to watch movies or listen to music.3. I still get a fair number of BSOD's, especially on startup and shutdown - it's often a driver error and I can't seem to fix this even though I've downloaded the latest driver updates from Acer's website. I often receive these errors if I simply shut the lid rather than fully turning the computer off, so I'm just now in the habit of manually shutting down every time. I've never lost data but this trend is a bit concerning.Otherwise everything has remained decent.

  Set up was a breeze. Screen size and keyboard are great. The price was great. I'm glad it's not a touchsceen. I had that feature on my last one and I would only recommend that if you really need it. Brushing hair or lint off the screen always messed things up. So far this laptop has been awesome and just what i needed.

  This is really a high quality machine. The price I paid almost reflected that quality, but I snagged it when an incredible deal was running. The m3 processor is more than enough power to do regular tasks that anyone does online plus all the productivity work that is needed in a workplace. My wife is a teacher and this was purchased for her, so most of this feedback is from what she's said as she's used it.First, let's talk about the display. It really is a beautiful display with accurate-enough colors. It gets a little over-saturated in some situations and under-saturated in others, creating some awkward hue on backgrounds of darker movies or webpages. But those are only noticeable while objects are moving (or when you're scrolling) and there's a lot of action on the screen. It gets bright enough for most situations and in the previous Pro model I wondered why it got as bright as it did. Watching reviews it seemed like you almost don't need to use a lamp to lighten a room, just turn the display face up and turn it up; that should be plenty to light an entire bedroom.Second is the quality of the material. The device feels like a brushed aluminum or other metal material with some plastic in some places. This is about right for the price, considering an even better quality of material would get you easily spending $900+. The keyboard feels fantastic and the touchscreen hasn't had a single hiccup yet after about 2 months of use.Third, let's talk about functionality. And, before we begin, let's remember this is a Chromebook. This wasn't purchased to play the latest games or sync with Microsoft or Apple services. It's a Samsung product running a Google operating system, meaning that it's meant to work with Google services. That said, it works wonderfully for Google Drive (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). This item is used almost exclusively to do lesson planning, grading, research, and other tasks that a teacher would do. For that, it's perfect. The only real issues we've had entail poor web design and a lack of websites switching to HTML5 instead of Flash.All in all, if you're wanting the performance of a Google Pixelbook and similar functionality then you won't be disappointed. If you want to get a loved one a computer that will really allow them to use the Internet without too much worry about viruses, then you're making a good purchase. If you're intending to get a laptop that can run Android apps without too much of a ""herky jerky"" experience, then you're making a good purchase. If you're wanting a computer that can run Photoshop, render 4K videos, or anything like that, then you're better off with other products.

  At around 550 to 650 price this is a great performer. Has a IPS like screen. I say that cuz not even Asus specs confirmd that but it's as good as a budget IPS display or VA panel. Performance wise cpu is as good as an 8th gen i5-8xxxU but with much better GPU then the Intel integrated. But the main drawback is that Asus did not put a good enough cooling solution or large enough battery(2 cell only) this battery is only about 3.5 to 4.5h depending on usage. As for cooling it gets loud and hot fast if you so much as watch Netflix, or install any software. I later got a lenovo flex with the same AMD cpu, and the heat/noise/battery issue was not a problem. So if your thinking it was an AMD problem it's not. Nither is it Asus but they should look into fixing this in a later revision.

  I took a chance on Lenovo and I’m glad I did! This laptop is great for the price I paid ($1320 +tax CAD). It’s pretty thin for the specs and light as well.The IPS 144Hz screen is fantastic! I have a 144Hz TN Monitor and this laptop’s screen blows it away with the colour vibrancy. It’s not as fast as a TN panel but if you put the screen on Over Drive (from the Lenovo Vantage software), it comes very close.The keyboard is only in white backlight, but I feel like it adds a more refined look as opposed to an RGB lit keyboard. The keys have a nice satisfying feeling when you type on them as well as using it for playing games.As for the sound of the fans, it wasn’t too loud. Of course gaming laptops will have audible fans during full load but it didn’t really bother me. The CPU would reach 91C but then go back down to the low 70s and high 80s. It didn’t thermal throttle at all. As for the 1660 Ti, the hottest it got for me was 70C at about 2 hrs of gaming. Pretty good.And no I’m not an influencer. I bought this with my own money.

  Runs great, the only issue this laptop has is the thermals. The fact that it can’t be undervolted is annoying however by controlling the fan speed manually and having a cooling pad to place the laptop on, my thermals peak at around 75 instead of the 95 I was originally getting.

  I will start out by saying that I am not a fan of the small light weight laptops.This laptop is an excellent choice for those that need to work online, processes documents or are generally doing low demand work. It is not a high performance gaming machine! It is simple to use, small and while light weight it does not give a cheep feeling.It utilizes a mobile processor and memory so the memory is not upgradeable but you can add extra storage. When opening up the storage slot I expected to find a drive already installed, what I found was an empty slot allowing me to add any size SSD. No need to reinstall windows as the operating system is retained on an eMMC drive that is built in.This is basically a Chromebook that runs Windows and actually lets you have some local storage. A perfect option for those already using a Chromebook but in need of Windows specific software!On first boot, after getting Windows fully set up, I found the internal 64 Gigabyte drive was about 50% used leaving little space for personal files of any size(which is why the expandable SSD slot is a great addition!) It is shipped with very little ""bloatware"" which greatly reduced my setup time and kept it running smooth and relatively fast. I did find that it has multiple language MS Office preinstalled, which I assume the system will delete the unneeded language packages after completing the installation of MS Office. I uninstalled MS Office because I don't need it on this PC and freed up a ton of space.My biggest complaint on this PC is the super large mouse pad. When typing my palm is forever moving the mouse around ad sometimes clicking on things. This is more of a ""me"" issue than one with the PC.

  Perfect! My trusty laptop died on me in the middle of my workday Friday-I needed something fast and inexpensive. Received this chromebook in one day and ZERO issue setting it up! All of my work bookmarks were loaded once I signed into Google. This laptop is perfect for the price point!

  This laptop has everything you need to game. RTX 2060 115W variant? Yes sir and also a chasis and cooling system good enough to handle it. AMD Ryzen 7 4800H? 8 cores and 16 threads? 4.2Ghz core speed? Oh yeah, best mobile CPU of 2020, yeah Intel i7 10750H can turbo 1 core to 5Ghz and gains like 3-5 FPS more, but its a 6 core CPU with heating issues unless you undervolt. So yeah 10/10 laptop.PS: Delivery time for Antonline said 2 weeks, it arrived in 4 business days, they send you the UPS track number to your e-mail.

  No esta nada mal y buen valor pero:1.  La camera la verdad no es de mucha calidad.  Voy a agregar otro para mi trabajo.2.  La pantalla no tiene el mejor imagen.  Bastante borrosoEs un buen equipo para el precio, pero si quieres video bueno sugiero otro modelo.  Yo uso monitores duales con el equipo asi que no es tan critico pero si ero mi unico remedio me hubiero cambiando por video mejor y precio mas alto.

  An awesome Chromebook for a reasonable price.  To be honest it looked new and has a quick, snappy feel to it.  I was a bit concerned because buying used electronics is always a bit of a gamble but in this case, I feel the item was carefully stored and well taken care of.  I would definitely highly recommend it.

  The unit I received (16GB RAM, 512 GB NVME SSD) was unable to wake up after going to sleep due to idle. If you use the [Start]->Power->Sleep menu option in Win10, it was able to wake up. This was also a 1st gen E15, not the latest 2nd Gen E15 that is widely available. The SSD was an aftermarket brand ""OEM Genuine"" with what appears to be a solid Silicon Motion controller. Otherwise the keyboard was comfortable and the design looks and feels sharp. I am just very disappointed with the inability to wake up from sleep - and I wonder if this has anything to do with the aftermarket upgrades.

  i totally disliked (and the reason for the return) the ""apparent"" need to have an micorsoft account to get the windows 10 that you paid for.  it should have come with windows 10 installed, but no, you have to create a microsoft account to get windows 10, and the computer going.  problem is for me i have been locked out of my microsoft account for 2 months, so this computer will make a really good 3rd base.I now know how to work around it, which i will do with the computer that  i will buy locally, since the on-line tech support for electronics is pretty worthless.  You ask them a question and, can you at least say ""DUH""

  I bought this laptop for a little over 400$, but it can be boightten new at Walmart for a little over 200$. I've only used it twice and so far I've had trouble getting it to come on and now my wifi will not connect, won't even pull up and wifi networks to connect to. Also the camera is really blurry/crappy. Is a very thin, cute, weightless laptop though.

  Best laptop I have owned.  A lot of tech for the money.  Runs smoothly no matter the task.  Games like Microsoft Flight Sim and Halo run great.  I don’t find that it gets too hot.  Fans spin up, but that is expected.  Beautiful screen.  I had low expectations here, so surprised. Movies look amazing.  Very user upgradable.  I added a second HD (1 TB).  I upgraded to 32G RAM.  Super easy.  Battery life is just ok, but didn’t expect too much from a gaming laptop.  Keyboard and backlight is nice.  Dell software for updates and maintenance is a nice plus.  Alien Software also a nice surprise,.  Laptop is nice just for web browsing, personal/business work and when want to play games it performs.  Highly recommended.  I like the design.  Plenty of ports and I find they are well placed.

  I purchased this for my girlfriend for Valentine’s Day. I am a fan of the 13.3 inch BMax I purchased for myself, and thought this larger version would be a great budget choice for a laptop for her.We usually use our laptops for Microsoft office work and shared online work (google docs, etc.). So far we have not had any issues getting the applications to run. We both have some issues clicking, but that could be user error.The only major concerns I have are the durability of the laptop. Of course that is one of the reasons why the laptop is cost efficient, but I would definitely recommend buying a case or sleeve to protect it. (Maybe BMax can create some hard shell cases similar to Apples). I would be willing to bet that one drop would destroy the laptop with no case on it. So when transporting it in a backpack, please be sure not to toss your bag on the ground/hard surface (especially if the bag does not have a padded bottom/designated sleeve for it).All in all this has shown to be a great budget laptop especially if you need to run windows versus chrome. Just make sure the device is well protected.

  That’s good.  I bought it for kids to use it for learning.  This is very useful.  If you just use it for work and study, I would recommend it.  Although it is not a brand, it has a high performance-to-cost ratio.  You can use it to watch TV and play small games.

  Not bad. I was looking for a good cheap 2 in 1 and I found it. I never heard ogBmax, but I've been pleasantly surprised.I wish it were larger, but that said the size isn't too bad. The scrren is responsive, the spees is good. It comes with awindows 10 pro instead of home, which is good.It is very light weight, but has a metal body which is cool.A couple if cons. The microsd card reader is problematic. Ive actually had to replace the device once because it ate the card. It lodged in a way that wasnt retrievable. When I got the replacement I was very careful and have no intent of ever removingbit.  The speakers suck, but it connects to a bluetooth speaker well. Also when you use it as a tablet the keyboard doesnt shut off. So if its resting in your hand the keys get pressed and if the curser is in an input field it will type which is stupid. It should have a switch or something.All in all Im glad I bought it. Also the OS is full windows not the tablet ""S"" version. You can download and use programs not just apps. I made sure of that. Also remember to get the usb adapers. This doesnt have standard usb
