HAOQIN HaoBook106 10.1 inch 2-in-1 Laptop Computer Touchscreen with Detachable Keyboard Intel Atom 2GB RAM 32GB ROM HD IPS Display Windows 10 Black,$209.99,5.0,"
  ¬†This detachable magnetic keyboard two-in-one tablet computer is adorable in that it is so much smaller than any other laptop that I‚Äôve owned. This Haobook106 has Micro USB port, USB3.0 port, HDMI port, DC jack, earphone jack, mic and TF card slot. It has a super thin 1280x800 IPS 10 inch high-definition touch screen display that works so effortlessly! Some of the specs are it has a 2GB RAM, 32GB of storage when support of TF card slot which can expand the storage up to 512GB! It has a very decent Camera 0.3MP+2.0MP (front and back camera). The battery is 6000mah and lasts me for days because it works so well.  The Operating system is Windows 10 which works like a charm on this device.My favorite aspect of this product is the detachable magnetic screen. It comes off so easily and quickly becomes a tablet for convenience of doing many things, but then it can fold up and be put away with added protection unlike most tablets that are exposed.I have a lot of future use in this product and look forward to experiencing it‚Äôs full potential. I would highly recommend this for a college student or for someone who likes and appreciates the multifunctional tablet to laptop capabilities. You must stay aware so that you do not pick it up by the screen because or disconnects so easily, which is a huge part of what I love about it. Just be aware.

  I ordered 2 of these tablet/laptops for my kids for Christmas. I was looking for a Windows based machine as the Google Chromebooks can't do some of the online games that they like. So, I researched and this one came up with pretty good reviews. It was a nightmare! First, just getting it set up was a pain but we got through all that and got the kids going. However, even though they weren't doing anything with major graphics or anything, the machines were SUPER slow. I have good internet and use multiple devices on it without this issue, so it isn't that. It was only slow on these machines. Additionally, it was so slow that many things wouldn't load or function at all. Really, just didn't have the capacity to do much of anything. I asked the kids and so now the laptops are on their way back in (For a $43 restocking fee per laptop btw). Cost me $86 for useless machines. Will never do again!

  We purchased this as an extra tablet to use with our label printer for our ecommerce business.  The sole use of this computer was to use the internet to generate shipping labels and then print the labels.  It stopped connecting to the internet after about 6 weeks and stopped connecting to the label printer (via USB) after about 7 weeks.  Extremely slow.  Honestly very painful to use especially considering we were only using it for one purpose.

  It stopped working and it over heats. The ROM and RAM is too low, and it frequently hangs. It‚Äôs keyboard is so small and gets jammed after 10 days or using it. I would rather go buy an acer or chrome book which costs the same price, rather than buying this China useless product

  Don‚Äôt buy it!  If you do, be very careful when opening it in ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù mode.  The tablet/top portion has 2 flimsy plastic tabs and one of them broke the 3rd time we used it.  Because one of the tabs broke, the top portion will not connect to the bottom/keyboard portion.  As such, it is useless.

  ¬†The days of paying $400 to $500 for even a entry level laptop is definitely gone. With these brands that are coming out, not only you can afford an entry level laptop for less than $300, they perform as good as some of the $500 laptops out there.This is one of the reasons why I bought a second laptop as our children are homeschooled and the technology seems to accelerate faster and the devices get outdated quickly. This laptop is very fast for its price range and it can do just more than light gaming as well as daily surfing and work-related tasks. The screen is nice and bright and can play HD videos and was able to play Roblox which seems to be very popular with kids nowadays without it lagging.The Wi-Fi also has the standard 5 gigahertz and 2.4 GHz antenna as well as Bluetooth connection so most modern devices will connect to this laptop perfectly fine. The surface area for the the touchpad is also large outside of using a mouse but it's nice and lightweight, it's thin, and for the price you can't beat it üòÉüëç

  I have used this laptop for about one week since it arrived, here are some of my opinions based on my experience. First, the size is very portable to carry around, with a 14 inch 1080p screen, it weighs less than 3 lbs, a perfect size-weight balance. It comes with win10 OS, I use it mainly to browser webs and watch Youtube video, it runs quite smooth. The screen looks good, too.It has two USB ports, like other laptop, while it also has a SD card tray, this is really good for those who want to store some large files. (I installed a 256G TF card)The speaker is located on the top of the 'C' side. The keyboard feels great, with a solid key travel, typing on it is comfortable.What I like most is its endurance. At 1080p 60fps video playback (60% brightness and 35% audio), the battery decreased from 100% to 86% after 1 hour, decreased to 43% after 4 hours, one charge is enough for one-day work.The disadvantages include that the keyboard does not have background light. Also the brightness is not light sensitive, which means you have to manually adjust it. Although these two features are not what we can expect at the entry level laptop, I do think it could affect user experience somehow. Overall, I like this laptop, it fulfilled my requirements for a leisure laptop with a ~$300 budget.

  Extremely FAST shipping! Came much faster than the ‚Äúexpected‚Äù delivery date. Amazing bundle for the price!I was always an Apple girl. After using a MxxBxxx Air for a really long time, this was a much needed upgrade, and cheaper. After checking out lots of different items, as a long time Windows system hater, I decided to give this one a try. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a smooth and powerful laptop for work or school! It connects well with your wifi and does not kick you out of in the middle an internet meeting, when your handy and iPad still work well with the same wifi!I use laptop mainly for the everyday small tasks. 14 Inches, 128 GB SSD, 6 GB DDR4 is enough.  I am a little bit surprise for the quick set-up procedures. It usually lasts very long in my memory. For Zoom meetings, emails, news, social media, movie, & keeping up with work related information, this little laptop works perfectly.  It has all-day battery life (Youtube music together with writing essay, worked around 7.5 hours), offers easy-to-use, cloud-based features for virtual student and remote worker.And the touch numeric keyboard is very funny. I resume my super quick typing speed with excel. Bravo!By the way, I LOVE the webcam baffle, as I always use post-it to cover all webcams at home.I think it is a good purchase.

  Great personal laptop for the price. Storage, resolution and processor are pretty standard. I have to say the numeric keyboard built into the touchpad is a plus. This is my first time using this kind of touchpad and I absolutely love it. Highly recommend for daily personal usage.

  I needed a light laptop dedicated to working therefore I don't have to carry my gaming laptop every day.I have somewhat experience with specs about pc components, so I'd like to give this ultra-budget laptop a try. Now I have been using it for a couple of days there are a few things I'd like to share.I'd admitted that its lightweight was such a relief for me to carry around and the overall built quality is aligned with the standard. Since I store all my files in the cloud, 128G is more than enough for me (there's an extra slot for expansion). 1080p res on 14inch is pretty standard. The speakers sound very well. I'm doing mostly typing works on this laptop so that the battery life feels eternal. In terms of the connectivity aspect, it has almost everything except for missing the Type-C port.Overall, I am satisfied with this laptop. If you just need a lightweight laptop that can do a daily office workload with some light entertainment. This is a fine piece.

  I wanted to try out a new laptop since my old one has been running for a long while and was pretty slow processing almost every thing. I use laptop mainly for my office job and do some entertainment as well, like listening to music and watching YouTube videos. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this when I order it, I thought it does look good and the price wasn‚Äôt bad. Gave it a try and got it yesterday. This guy is a surprise. It‚Äôs pretty, thin and light weight. It‚Äôs barely 3 lbs, much lighter than my previous one. It is plastic but in a nice way. I used it to play online music yesterday for 8 to 9 hours, and the battery drains to 7%. Fairly good battery I think. Better than my old pal. Overall, at this price point, it‚Äôs a pretty good laptop. It exceeds my expectations. Satisfied customer right here. ;)

  The laptop can meet your basic needs and is good for kids to do their homework. The product design is clean, sleek and lightweight, great for a business image. And the setup is quite easy! I like the Screen resolution which is clear and crisp.The battery life is really cool. I use this laptop for my zoom meetings and it really lasts 7-8 hours.  Very impressive! Most importantly, If you need to replace it, it is inexpensive. I think it is a good product for the price.

  I have been using this for about a week for my work.  I like lightweight laptops, so it's perfect that this is just about 3 pounds.  The keyboard feels good, even without the background light, and the number pad on the touch screen is better than I expected. The charge is good so far...just one charge for a full working day for me.  I don't think I'll buy a really expensive brand name laptop again...when I just need the basics, internet, word processing, YT videos, etc...this is perfect for a smaller budget.

"2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray",NA,5.0,"
  I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.

"2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray",NA,5.0,"
  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.

  I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.

  I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

  Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However, I would say something different.For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip, I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it's useless).Secondly, would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface, the MacBook turns off itself. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.Also, I miss the MagSafe...

  I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

  Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon

  I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.

  UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.

  The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn‚Äôt turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn‚Äôt figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.

  Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.

  Beautiful laptop. I‚Äôve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn‚Äôt overly pricey to be honest and I feel it‚Äôs worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I‚Äôve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.

  No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I‚Äôm very happy with this upgrade.

  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!

  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.

  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?

  After passing off last year's model to my brother (3500U Flex 14), I got this as soon as I saw it posted up on Reddit. I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since.Let's get the rundown here.- Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU- Radeon Vega 6 graphics- 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop)- 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD- 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!)Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but it opens up almost all the way with one hand (tilts towards the end). The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more ""premium."" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2.I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W).The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a ""worst case"" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all!Camera is acceptable. Nothing to write home about, but it'll work well enough for video calls. Battery is excellent - while browsing the web and watching videos, I have been consistently draining 10% per hour of use! That 10 hour claim from Lenovo seems pretty spot on.Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier:- 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7- Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (4700U option is now available in some places)- Metal constructionI'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing.

  ***UPDATE 3 - 12/2/20 - Have had several issues recently and wanted to pass along how I resolved them.  Issue #1 was trying to boot up the computer after 12 hours of sleep and being unable to get the computer to turn on at all.  Didn't matter if it was plugged in or not.  The battery was fully charged.  I tried holding the power button.  No go, laptop was dead.  As a final attempt before sending it in for service, I pulled off the bottom cover of the laptop and disconnected the battery cable for several minutes.  I plugged it back in, pressed the power button,and the laptop booted normally.  Everything worked fine after that and I haven't had the issue since.  Issue #2 was noticing the laptop was no longer charging when connected to the USB-C charger.  Even the charging LED wouldn't come on.  The fix was to shut down the computer completely, then hold the power button for 20-40 seconds.  The charge light came on and the laptop started charging again.**UPDATE 2 - 7/2/20 - Resolved an audio stuttering issue by turning off Dolby Audio processing in the Dolby app.***UPDATE - 6/10/20 - Dropping a star.  Sent original back due to crashing issues when waking from sleep.  Wifi also dropped occasionally and had trouble reconnecting after sleep.  New unit seems to work fine.  Also replaced wireless card with Intel AX200 (need torx T5 bit to remove bottom panel).  Much faster and no dropped connections.  Still really like the laptop (and Amazon's return policy).*Original Review:Overall usability ‚Äì Everything about the laptop feels well-built and like it should cost hundreds more.  Incredibly fast processor, especially given the 15W TDP.  The AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors (7nm Zen 2) have really improved the thermals and efficiency to the same level as Intel (or better).  Between the 6 core processor and the  PCIe NVMe SSD the laptop flies.  Nothing I‚Äôve thrown at it has been able to slow it down or make it stutter.  Benchmarks comparable to my HP desktop with i7-7700 (if in best performance mode while plugged in).  Applications open instantly in most cases.  Comes out of short-term sleep instantly.  Nice webcam privacy cover.  Fingerprint reader is best I‚Äôve used in terms of accuracy and speed.  Fans are quiet under normal loads and a low non-annoying whirring when the GPU/CPU is taxed.Exterior ‚Äì Very light weight (but not cheap feeling) and nice sturdy build.  Feels like it will hold up well.  Keyboard back-light adjustable.  Plenty of ports.  Hinges also feel built to last.Touchscreen ‚Äì Sensitive and good feel (though I prefer matte to glossy).  Works well with included pen.Bloatware ‚Äì Almost none (uninstalled Skype).Speakers ‚Äì Above average for price range.  Not especially tinny sounding like cheaper laptops.  Don‚Äôt expect bass though.  The included Dolby equalizer software can help improve the sound if you don‚Äôt mind experimenting.  Side-mounted front-facing speakers are well placed.Screen ‚Äì Brightness OK for indoor use, but I plan to run it at 90% brightness even on battery because anything less is too dim.  Colors are bright.  No noticeable back light bleed.Battery life ‚Äì Above average for price range.  Really quite impressive.  Could easily last half to three-quarters of the stated 10 hours depending on the conditions (clearly not doing anything processor or graphics intensive for the duration, but web browsing, office work, or video viewing).Wireless/Bluetooth ‚Äì Some occasional random disconnects and trouble connecting after sleep, likely due to Realtek wireless card.  Average speeds on my 5GHz home network.Keyboard/Trackpad ‚Äì High quality feel.  You can tell when you‚Äôve hit a key unlike cheaper laptops.  Miss the numpad, but knew it didn‚Äôt have one before I ordered.  Trackpad not over-sensitive or unresponsive.  Good balance, but still prefer a mouse.Graphics/Gaming ‚Äì Played Two-Point Hospital on Steam at 1080p very high graphics setting.  Not very graphics intensive or an FPS, but the game is newer and frame-rate didn‚Äôt drop below 30 in game.  Game load times are ridiculously fast.Downsides ‚Äì Mediocre webcam.  Soldered RAM (not a big deal w/16 GB, but if it goes bad it is a big problem).  Screen may not be bright enough for outdoor use and the glossy coating leads to reflections/glare when viewing from an angle.  Wireless card not great.  Stories of poor tech support (though, admittedly I‚Äôve never interacted with them).**Don‚Äôt forget to create your USB backup drive from the Lenovo website for crashes/re-installs.  Or have the Windows 10 ISO handy on a USB drive and download the drivers/apps from the website.

  ¬†For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the ""Lenovo Representative"" knows nothing about their product. Yes, it has dual channel 16GB RAM @ 3200mhz, it ships with the Lenovo pencil included. Screen is only @ 250 nits, but I wouldn't call it a deal breaker unless you plan to use it outdoors a lot. Plastic machine but nothing feels cheap. The hinge is a little loose to my taste, the touchpad is a little shaky. Other than those, everything fits my needs. Very satisfying first day of use.Update: the audio starts to cutoff randomly from the 2nd day, all drivers and windows updates and BIOS are up to date. I contacted both Amazon and Lenovo tech support, after a remote session, the problem persists. Then I noticed the trackpad is shaky and sticky ( see video).So overall it's a nice product, but quality control can be a problem.

  The 1 star is for the poor quality control by Acer.I received the laptop and immediately started to set it up. Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer‚Äôs quality control.I can‚Äôt really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start. I‚Äôm hoping that is the only issue with the machine as most reviews I‚Äôve read about the Nitro 5 are positive.Update: It has been 22 days since I received the brand new laptop from Amazon. Acer repair has had the laptop for 14 days now and I still have not received any info about the status of my case other than it is still being repaired.  I am not happy about having to wait 3+ weeks to have a brand new working laptop.

  I included potential solutions to the problems I had in the cons section.Pros:-slim size, easy to take on the go-cheap-open slots inside to upgrade componentsCons (that I found solutions to):-loud fans, combined with poor audio quality. The built in speaker volume needs to be turned up pretty high to hear over the fan noise. The fan noise also means you should leave your mic on push to talk rather than open during online games, otherwise your poor teammates will have to listen to it constantly. Good news is there is blue tooth, so I suggest connecting external speakers or headphones instead.-hot CPU. Make sure your battery settings are on ""better performance"" rather than ""best performance"", regardless of if it's plugged in or not. Otherwise, the CPU hits 90 C. Better to have less performance or learn to undervolt if you want the laptop to last very long.-wrong GPU used during gaming. If you have really bad performance, it could be that the laptop is using the Intel GPU rather than the GTX 1650. Go into NVIDIA Control Panel, and under ""manage 3D settings"" and ""global settings"", switch preferred graphics processor to ""high-performance NVIDIA processor"" rather than auto.-laptop suddenly restarts within seconds of booting up, when not plugged into power. For me, going into startup apps and turning off ""Delayed Launcher"" fixed this.-not enough space, and plenty of bloatware to make it worse. Definitely invest in at least 1TB of additional storage. 256 GB is only enough space for two or three games, unless you only play games from the 90's.Cons (without solutions I could find):-yellowish smudges at the top of the screen, only visible though when the screen is black-the touch pad is terrible. It's on the left for some reason, so both your hands have to be crammed left to use them during games. Not an issue if you use controllers or a mouse. Also, the mouse is very delayed and floats around. Tried updating drivers but nothing works, it's super laggy most of the time!-keyboard lights only turn on when a key is pressed and automatically turn off after 30 seconds. There is no way to leave them on, which sucks when you're using it in the dark. There are forums complaining about this, and the company refuses to add the feature to leave them on even though many people are requesting the option.-short battery life. This doesn't bother me because I view gaming laptops more like transportable desktops, but keep in mind that this will not last you very long if you want to play on the bus or plane.

  The best laptop a 10 year old ‚Äúgamer girl‚Äù could ask for! I‚Äôm blown away at how nice this laptop is, especially for the price.NOTE : External hard drive will need to be purchased separately though if you‚Äôre wanting to run more than two games on it, simply because it doesn‚Äôt have a large enough internal drive to run more than that.

  I want to point out ive only had it a week and will update if anything changes about my review. Overall, before I get into details, I am very satisfied with this laptop and it‚Äôs performance.The pricing as what I bought was 1418.99$ for the intel i7-10750H with the rtx 3060 and 500G m.2. The availability of laptops has been pretty bad and I feel I wasn‚Äôt overcharged for the current market.Pros:Rtx 3060 is a little better than imagined. It is the 80W variant but will turbo up to 100W with spikes over 115W very well.The turbo button above the keyboard is actually more useful than I would have expected. In cyberpunk at max settings with medium ray tracing it‚Äôs an easily playable 55 FPS and turbo activated averages around 5fps or more higher even in the worst areas.Temperatures at first freaked me out cause I saw spikes over 90C. But I found it was only temporary and the average with a decent fan curve was around 69 to 75C on both cpu and gpu.Predator sense software built in is useful. But I still downloaded MSI afterburner for in game over lay though.Cons:Fans get pretty loud when you activate turbo. So if you got a decent headset and nobody around you it won‚Äôt bother you. But if your around people they will think you have a jet engine running. But even without turbo mode you get more than playable frame-rates in every game I‚Äôve played. Most newer titles like cyberpunk and ValhallaBattery is whatever. It‚Äôs maybe an hr usage if you‚Äôre playing heavy games and 7 hrs if you keep power saver mode on and only use it for light work like google chrome or YouTube.Other aspects:Screen was nothing special. Not super bright but not excessively dark or glare issues. Keyboard is fine. Again, nothing special. It‚Äôs a laptop. Bloatware wasn‚Äôt too bad. Just uninstalled it all. But overall it is a quick responsive little laptop for easy gaming and even can do some work. I‚Äôm very satisfied because I‚Äôm a trucker on the road everyday and needed something a little more portable but still had performance to play the newer games without going to a 2 grand or more computer. I would recommend it to others.Edit: I forgot to say the pictures are without turbo and with turbo on 3D mark timespy score.

I have pushed this thing to its limits Days Gone PC version that's just released on the 18th I can play MAXED OUT setting on everything and it never dipped below 90fps and my average was around 124-127fps, this thing is just as powerful as my RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Trio gpu in my one desktop, I own an RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 3080 but they're all Desktop Gpu's but it definitely gives the 2070 Super Desktop GPU some good competition without a doubt. And it's Ampere 8nm architecture so newest Nvidia technology compared to 12nm Turing architecture, and the screen is absolutely gorgeous playing day or night with a true IPS display running at 144Hz @ 3ms, if you want a SOLID GOOD LAPTOP FOR GAMING, this is it, the ACER Predator Helios 300 can't be beat and I own Asus/Origin/Dell etc etc laptops as well and nothing ever Beats my ACER LAPTOPS, and this beauty is made of a nice metal and sturdy plastic on certain parts but mostly metal and u can see the quality ACER put into this laptop, and yes the PREDATOR symbol on the screen lights up and its perfect for letting others know you mean business lol I recommend 100% for the bang for your buck! That's it that's all I got for ya

  I bought this for my son. He picked it out as he is way more tech savvy than me. He's impressed with its specs. He spent a long time looking for the best machine in the budget I gave him. He plays VR and a bunch of games with it

  I had it a week ago and tested lots of thing. I am quite satisfied with its design, build quality, and, of course, performance.I bought it for 1250$ on 14th April. It came with i7-10750h, rtx 3060, and 500G m.2. I bought it with discount and I think it is frequently on discount.Thermal impressed me the most for the laptop. When turbo mode is not activated, fans are not that loud and GPU temperature is around 70 degree and CPU temperature is around 78 degree in heavy games in performance mode. If you activate turbo mode temperatures decrease to 60 degree. Turbo mode also increase FPS a bit, but GPU power does not increase more than 90W. You can play every game easily with this laptop at high FPS for sure.Only bad thing is fans get really loud in turbo mode. If you have a decent headphone, so no problem. However, the sound is more like plane engine.Battery is not bad. It goes 1hr for gaming, but for light work it can go approximately 6hr. Screen is also good, it is 144hz and 15.6"" at 1080p. It is also matte and gorgeous, but fingerprint magnet. Overall laptop is fingerprint magnet.  Keyboard is also reassuring and used plastic and aluminum for all laptop are good-looking and solid.

  Honestly the system is exactly what I want. Simple gaming system I can travel with, the graphics card is better than other systems at the price, and I was able to use the internal M2 spot to install a 1TB drive. all in all Star Citizen, Doom, World of Warcraft and multiple other games are running great faster than my gaming desktop.Only downside is it is only 1080p but for the price & it is easy to overlook. and don't touch the screen it isn't touch screen.

  Nothing much to complain about really. It's good. Just felt suspicuous about it. Like it felt like someone was trying to track where the computer went or something. The blue tooth was left on and the laptop turns on as soon as you lift the top up. I found that wierd. Very weird.

  I wasn't fully sure what to expect, I've never had a chromebook but really needed something that I could take with me on the go to work on my shop updates, work stuff, and school when that starts up. It's taking some getting used to but I'm loving it so far! Battery life is as expected, I left it on overnight and I still had a full battery the next morning. Touchscreen is responsive. Shipping was STUPID FAST, ordered it Saturday night and received it Monday out here butt-shuck nowhere, Wyoming. So, ya know, impressive. Definitely like a tablet with a keyboard, but it's so much better than any tablet I've used. I have a fire kindle (same thing as a tablet imo. One of those gifts you get and you're like ""ohhhhhhhh, thaaaaankkkkksssss....I'ma never use this. But thank you."" Obviously you never tell them that because that would be rude, so instead it sits in the bookcase with your hard copies collecting dust because you don't want to get rid of it and have them find out.) and -anyway- this thing blows it out of the park. Feels lightweight but sturdy at the same time, it's no little biiiish, it feels like it can hold it's own.

  I'm 72 and have been agonizing replacing my aging Asus laptop. Back and forth between a Chromebook or a laptop. Read reviews on the differences, threw a dart, and ordered this Chromebook. What a great decision. Opened it up, plugged it in and turned it on. Then answered a few questions and it synched with my Note8. I like to cook and can hardly wait to look up a recipe, tent it, and start creating.  I have very simple computer needs, email, banking, and, looking up recipes. For me this is a 5.

  Much faster and of course newer than my old Acer 15"" Chromebook, which was one of the first 15"" models they made and the only 15"" Chromebook on the market when I bought it. I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn't support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name.I'll start off by saying this thing feels really sturdy, built well in typical Acer fashion. But I'm kind of surprised with how big the bezels are, they easily could've put a bigger screen in the thing. The screen that is installed though is plenty bright enough for my use, and is perfectly sharp at a typical viewing distance with good viewing angles. The touchscreen is kind of flaky in my experience, but that could be a problem with the user since some touchscreens just don't like responding well to my fingers. Performance in typical use is perfectly fine, but don't expect to do much gaming as it doesn't have the power to run more intense Android games smoothly. WiFi is very fast and signal is excellent. The ports provided are great, and I love that it can be charged from either USB-C port. The keyboard feels pretty good and the trackpad is about what you'd expect on a device like this.Now where I am truly disappointed is in the fact that stylus support was removed from the last model of this system. I'm a bit of an artist and like to draw on occasion, even if it's just playing a round of Draw Something to fix my itch. I thought drawing on this with an Android app would be pretty nice compared to my Note phone. And another person had already asked if this system supported an active stylus, which Acer responded by saying yes. This thing absolutely does NOT support an active stylus. At least not an EMR one like you find in Samsung devices (S-Pen) or a Wacom stylus. I'm tempted to send this model back and order the older one since there doesn't seem to be much difference between the N3350 and N4020 CPUs.I'll also mention here that the indent for the second camera that goes above the keyboard for use in tablet mode is present, but there isn't a camera. I was unsure what this indent was for until I did some more reading online and found a review for a pre-release version of this system. That included the camera and stylus. Seems they changed their minds on both features but didn't bother to get rid of the indent.Long story short, it's a good little 2-in-1 but some design choices are odd for a device in 2020. Also many of the reviews out there are for the last model (N3350 CPU) or for pre-production test units that have features this thing actually doesn't have (stylus and second camera). Also look at the true reviews closely as this thing is offered with the Intel CPU (N4020), and AMD CPU, and a MediaTek CPU.

  Got this for elementary school children. I've never owned a chromebook so didn't know what to expect, but so far it has impressed me.  Easy to setup with a google account.  Also like how you can apply parental controls using google family.  As far as the device itself-- love the touchscreen.  My kids don't really use the flipped mode but i like that it is an option.  Very happy with my purchase.  Also, I didn't buy the extended protection but am now thinking I will.

  This is probably the best $400 Chromebook on the market right now.  Unfortunately, I had to return mine.  The display is a nice full HD 1920 x 1080 with bright crisp color.  The keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is large and responsive.  Browsing the web is very quick.  I benchmarked this machine with Octane 2 and got a score of around 12000.  Not bad for a Celeron.  So... why did I send it back.  The problem was that the Chromebook I received had two manufacturing flaws.  The case is aluminum which is great, but the bottom edge of my case had a sharp edge going all way around.  I think the aluminum case was a fraction of a millimeter too wide.  It wasn't sharp enough to cut, but it gave the Chromebook an unfinished feel.  The second problem was that the trackpad was loose.  It worked fine, but when you tapped (which you do a lot on Chromebooks), the trackpad rattled slightly.  I thought I could live with it, but the more I used it, the more crazy it made me.  Hopefully, these build problems were only on the Chromebook that I received and all the other Acer 514s do not have these issues.

  bought at $249.00 Respectable specs for price given current demand. Getting 8+ hours of battery life surfing web and watching YouTube. If you cant tell from pics. micro SD slot reader for media and volume rocker on side. your play store app compatibly will vary. please note that only about 20 GB of that storage is available for apps. if you are new to Chromebooks (or computers in general) this is more of a tablet+ than a full laptop replacement

  Taking a look at the specs of this laptop, you would expect it to be incredible, especially for this price point. Taking a look at the online reviews shows that the screen isn't the best, and it takes a few more hits, but even so it looks like an amazing deal. After using it, in my opinion it's worth the money, but not as fantastic as it appears.TLDR: Look at what you want in a laptop before buying this one. For me it works fine but there are a few key drawbacks that might affect different tasks you would want to use this laptop for.The PRO's+ Build Quality is fantastic, with sturdy metal and a keyboard I surprisingly quite enjoy using.+ Big PRO: The Ryzen 4700U processor is a beast, and the snappiest processor I've used. Productivity use such as coding, taking notes in class, running other professional programs like the Microsoft suite or Zoom are handled easily and perfectly.+ Big PRO: A 512GB SSD for this price is incredible! And it's even a really good SSD at that.The CON's- The screen is as bad as they say, even after calibration. It's only slightly better than my old laptop I bought for $350 a few years ago. However, as someone who doesn't use the laptop for video editing, it's not a big issue for me, but everything does look more green/blue than it should.- I've had software problems with this laptop that I would not have expected from a pre-built laptop, especially from a company like Acer. I have problems with apps being fuzzy (not scaling to the display properly), problems with Cortana and the Windows Start menu, and problems with the screen not immediately waking from sleep. These problems are rare and/or not too impactful, but still annoying.- The BIGGEST CON by far is the thermals. The laptop has amazing specs as I mentioned above, but it can't use them to their full potential because the components get too hot and have to cut back on speed. The fans are noisy and run at full speed often. I regularly experience temps of 70¬∞+ while web browsing, and 90¬∞+ while (light) gaming or other more intensive tasks.To me that is a huge letdown, as this laptop does not perform heavy tasks like it should. The processor is limited by the cooling of the laptop and can't really do all that it's has the potential to do.Overall, I am disappointed by the low upper limit of the hardware, but for my needs as a tech-savvy college student looking for a good laptop for classes, it's perfect. It's light and portable, sturdy, fast, and cheap. Even the gaming/heavy use cases are.... acceptable, even if they aren't what they could be. I recommend this laptop to many people, but it's not for everyone.

  I try really hard not to do same-day delivery reviews, no matter how great I think the product is because you can never tell on that first day what might go wrong later. However, I am actually confident and happy enough with this one to go for it. If I make amendments later, they won't likely be anything that changes this rating. (updated 6/19/20 - one week, using it for work in web design and content creation, still love it)I needed a business-appropriate laptop. My requirements for this were pretty simple: something with a sharp but conservative appearance, MOBILE (not heavy or bulky), but also just as powerful (or capable of being just as powerful) as my much larger personal laptop. It came down to this and the Lenovo Flex. I chose this because the design was all metal, and I liked Macbook Airs when working as an Apple systems manager for their durability, style, and mobility. It's just a shame the RAM is not upgradeable (it's soldered). The RAM on the Lenovo Flex is not upgradeable either, though. It also comes with a weaker processor (Ryzen 5, which isn't quite on the i7's level). I doubt anyone will need more than 8 to 16GB of RAM in the lifetimes of these laptops. I knew that if I got a Ryzen 5 that would just make me want the Ryzen 7 processor more (you can never upgrade processors in a laptop). So, despite toting less RAM, Swift still came out as the winner both in design and performance when I compared it up close to the Flex online.I worried a bit when I read a review that complained about the screen and graphics on Swift being almost unusable. But I clearly had nothing to worry about. Those professional reviewers sometimes can get so snobby with hardware, they set the bar higher than anyone in the real world would ever set it.The screen is semi-matte. I have very sensitive eyes, sensitive enough that I often have to wear blue light blocking glasses to deal with sunlight, bright indoor lights, or computer light. Even the slightest flicker is noticeable to me in a very uncomfortable, painful kind of way that strains my eyes. There's the tiniest amount of flicker in this display. It is NOTHING like the reviews have been describing, which made me afraid I wouldn't be able to use this laptop. It's VERY easy on my eyes after switching the AMD Radeon settings to Enhanced and High Res (which simultaneously smoothes and sharpens up the text, making it more legible). It also does NOT have a glossy, highly reflective screen. The screen is semi-matte at the worst (honestly, it's not even that much), and it's full matte once it's turned on. Evidently Acer has switched displays after the complaints (they tend to be good about doing things like that). It gets super bright, and the colors are close to true as far as I can tell - only publishing something is going to reveal the truth there, which I haven't done yet. But again, I can't believe what a close call it is to a Macbook Air.The graphics performance: It's not a gaming laptop, though I'm sure it is good enough to play most games on medium and would be PERFECT for a student. It's definitely strong enough to perform smoothly for graphic artists, photographers, and anyone that tends to keep a ton of tabs open in their browser. Smooth scrolling and rendering, no lag or glitching.I cannot compliment the Ryzen 7 processor enough. I am moving from an 8th gen i7 and the Ryzen 7 is WAY more responsive and less prone to freezing or errors. I can very easily believe it maxes out at 4ghz. Those eight cores handle multitasking like a true champ.I was worried the RAM would give me some issues with work because it's only 8gb and it's also underpowered to help boost battery performance. So far, I've been surprised to find that this low-powered RAM actually keeps up with me despite my issues with never exiting or closing windows, lol.The keyboard is extremely comfortable if you have small to medium-sized hands. There is some time to adjust to the smaller form factor. Large handed people will immediately hate the keyboard because it's compact. This being said, it IS a large keyboard as far as COMPACT keyboards go, and it is 100% identical to the keyboard on the Macbook Air. Same feel and everything. Backlit keys, which you can switch on or off. Something SUPER cool is that Acer figured out how to include a Numlock and number keypad on it by marking some of the letter keys with numbers, then adding a Numlock. (check my pictures)If you turn on the manual equalizer in the audio settings and crank it up, the speakers actually get really loud, and they're nice that way too (no rattle, no stress on the drivers). By default though, I can easily see tons of folks complaining about the speakers not getting loud. They don't get loud at all by default. With the equalizer maxed out, I would compare them to a mini Bluetooth speaker.In short, don't buy this for audio unless you're planning on connecting it to different speakers. For normal casual usage, like watching YouTube videos or streaming movies, the built-in speakers should be just fine.The lid is very well hinged. The screen is reinforced as well. Dropping it may cause some cosmetic damage, but it should hold up in most cases. At the worst, you'll be looking at a little cosmetic damage (scratches, dings) and a busted screen. Which is better than what you could face with the typical plastic body. I once dropped a plastic body laptop off the back of my car (I was an idiot and left it on the hood). It totally destroyed the body... the laptop still worked, but there was bare PCB board everywhere. It was ugly, lol.Now, there are complaints about battery life on this, but I haven't had any problems. I also didn't go with default settings in some key areas, though. I changed the Radeon settings to focus more on battery life than performance. Then I changed the power settings to best battery life. Now, I don't consider this to be much, especially with my huge collection of background apps, but considering complaints saying the battery wouldn't last more than an hour... hmmm. I'm not seeing it. I've been on battery for an hour now, and have 12h 46m remaining after charging to 98%. I'm guessing the expected battery life will hang somewhere between 4.5h and 6h on medium.Overall, it's a great machine and an awesome value in my book. I have no idea why the pro reviewers thought so poorly of it (though they did give it respect as a budget laptop). Maybe they were comparing it to more expensive laptops instead of comparing it to other models in this price range....? Or maybe the older version of this was really that bad.Whatever. I'm sticking with this because IT WORKS.Update: Two months later... it's still running like the day I got it. I'm actually shocked that it continues to perform so well on 8GB of energy saving RAM. I am guessing the difference lies in a combo of using a better processor and using a solid state drive. My other laptop has an A12, which is quad core and goes up to 3ghz - this Ryzen 7 is octacore and goes up to 4ghz.The Care Center app has a function in it to make the battery only change to 80% when it's plugged in (saves the battery cells from being burned out). So despite using it plugged in all the time, I have not lost any battery health. It still goes for six hours or more off battery.

  Just received the laptop today. It is amazing. The display is awesome. The laptop is very light (~2.6lb) and it is well constructed overall.  The keyboard is great with a few quirks e.g. a somewhat strong back-light. The performance is awesome, and it is relatively quiet.  I have seen laptops with poorer performance that are ~2X in cost. Kudos to AMD and Acer for bringing an excellent product at the right price point to market.

  First and foremost, this thing is tiny, I'm pretty sure most phones are bigger than this. The keyboard is completely unusable, irredeemably awful would be too kind. The battery life is unimpressive, and the processing ""power"" that so many ostensibly professional reviewers were blown away by has been noticeably absent. Often opening a simple menu will cause the cursor icon to visibly stutter. And the heat that this thing produces, even on stand-by, leads me to believe it will be a very short lived piece of hardware.Worst of all, and most inexcusable, using anything other than the bloated installation of Windows 10 it comes with is made essentially impossible by the complete and total lack of driver support. Simple things like the touchpad won't work, and Acer couldn't be bothered to make those drivers available. I didn't buy this out the back of a van in a Safeway parking lot, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a modicum of basic support. Maybe if they spent a little less money on photoshoots of supermodels looking inquisitively into the distance they could afford to host a few hundred megabytes worth of files. Acer is pathetic.

  ¬†I was angry of seeing this kind of fake like screen. Description says it is 178view angle. 178 is ips screen. This one has 20degree view angle i saw in 1997. Maybe it is a fake laptop or screen replaced. This screen extinct in 21st century. You cannot figure out what color is it that that you are seeing on the screen. NOT AT ALL. Screen brightness change even if you move slightly. No matter what distance between 5‚Äù ~3ft. It is that bad.  NO matter how you see, top and bottom of the screen have different color and brightness.

  Really like this purchase. Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.

  The worst brand new laptop computer I have ever purchased. Screen quality is so so. Can‚Äôt run simple games without lagging out.. audio isn‚Äôt even relevant. Can‚Äôt hear it at all on 100% volume. Audio jack stopped working on the 5th day. Mouse touchpad stopped working after a week. Just bad bad bad. Spend a hundred more on something worth while.

  Ok. Lets talk. No fluff, no fake optimism. Out of all the things I have ever bought on amazon, this purchase was honestly the best. First of all, this laptop exceeded all expectations I had. Like for example, when I saw the laptop for the first time, the screen was sooo much bigger than I anticipated! I love the feeling of the keys. Also, I'm sure you've notice there are a lot of reviews complaining about the screen quality. Ok. Here's the tea sis; the screen is awesome. I'm not seeing anything wrong with it. Those people must be computer experts but for me, there is nothing wrong with it. Also, a big criteria for me was that I could do some gaming. Dude. Literally this laptop is awesome for gaming. It has taken everything that I've downloaded so far and is still purring like a kitten. Overall, this is a super good laptop. I totally think you should get it.

  I had the battery charger plugged in.  I found the laptop to be VERY HOT and it won't turn on.  It's toast.I am so upset.  I'm going to buy a different brand this time.  There doesn't seem to be any warrantyon this.

  Let's start with the hardware itself. I was worried the screen would be as terrible as some of these reviews indicate. In my opinion, the screen is just fine. It's probably not great in very bright sunlight, or for video or photo editing purposes. Otherwise, if you just want to do indoor office work, or browse the web, it's totally sufficient and not a reason to pass up this laptop. If you are already used to higher quality displays or have demanding display needs, stop being cheap and look to spend a bit more money.I like the feel and look of the keyboard but I don't like the layout so much. It's novel to include the keypad on a laptop of this size, but it's too close to the other keys. The result is that sometimes you hit the number pad instead of enter, or backspace. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker, and if you type a lot like I do, you'll probably find that you can develop a type of muscle/spacial-familiarity to where it becomes an infrequent issue very quickly.I bought this laptop to install linux on. It required a bit of wrangling with the BIOS to make that possible. Firstly, secure boot and some other settings need to be disabled in the BIOS. Next problem was, this machine does not seem to be capable of booting from the microSD card slot at all. I was able to boot off a USB-connected drive. Once I set the built-in storage interface mode to AHCI in the BIOS, I was able to complete my installation and everything works great. For the record I installed the ""elementaryOS"" distro.

  CPU: Great works quicklyRam: 8gb works quicklyBest budget laptop hands down....The screen though is pure garbage. viewing angles are horrible and the panel is just gray.... idk how to explain it but yeah.... it sucks but for $400 you aren't going to find a better laptop so 5 stars for the price.

  I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up.

  It looks new and is fast, has a long battery life, and is spot on what we needed.  Just a fast device that we can search the web on and project onto a television screen.  Lightweight so we can move it around easily and small so it tucks away when not in use.  Can't beat the price for this level of computer.

  For the price, this is a great Chromebook. It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research.1. Solid build. Nice sturdy plastic chassis. (Keeps it lightweight)2. USB type C port, SD card slot, HDMI, and USB 3.03. Touchscreen with an IPS display4. 4 gigs of RAM and 64gig of storage. (rare at this price point)5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad.6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.

  Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.

  Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can‚Äôt be downloaded on this chrome book.

  Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed.

  Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users.

  I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot.

  Pros:‚Ä¢ USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won‚Äôt feel worried that you‚Äôre not going to bend it.‚Ä¢ The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.‚Ä¢ Cortana listens to you pretty well. I‚Äôm learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.‚Ä¢ Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.‚Ä¢ Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it‚Äôs placed on my lap.‚Ä¢ microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)‚Ä¢ Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you‚Äôre planning to edit videos on this.‚Ä¢ Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and‚Ä¢ Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don‚Äôt expect the same results when using an off-brand.‚Ä¢ A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.‚Ä¢ The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.‚Ä¢ The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it‚Äôs quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.‚Ä¢ I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:‚Ä¢ The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can‚Äôt be ignored in 2019. It‚Äôs very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).‚Ä¢ With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.‚Ä¢ Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it‚Äôll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.‚Ä¢ The battery life isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôm getting around 8 hours of power. That‚Äôs having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it‚Äôs nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.‚Ä¢ Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn‚Äôt test these as you only get the tablet.‚Ä¢ Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we‚Äôre already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.‚Ä¢ I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn‚Äôt for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you‚Äôre going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It‚Äôs disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you‚Äôre pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can‚Äôt attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can‚Äôt tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I‚Äôm also irritated that Microsoft didn‚Äôt at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you‚Äôll know that Microsoft put all their money on what‚Äôs inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that‚Äôs the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I‚Äôm always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can‚Äôt do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you‚Äôre getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.

  This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price

  I've been using a chromebook as my primary computer for well over 5 years.  The last one I used was an Acer c720 with an i3 processor, I loved that thing.... I replaced the battery and it still works great but this deal was too good to pass up. $450 for a 7th generation m3 processor convertible chromebook with a dedicated stylus is a great deal.  Considering google is offering free note taking apps on the offers page also sweetens the deal.  In my opinion, this computer is a significantly better value than anything you'd get from a windows computer in this price range.I initially ordered this when it was priced $495 and a 3rd party retailer sent me an xe521qab (dark grey) instead of the listed xe520qab (light grey).  I'm going to compare both units at the end.I'm starting with reviewing the specs and hardware since I think mentioning overall build quality is important and why I chose this unit over others. I'm also going to compare both models since everyone needs to know what they're buying before they actually buy it. I'm also going to touch briefly on the capabilities of Chrome OS and its limitations so first time buyers have an idea what they're getting.Pros:- Convertible, able to run Android apps- Included stylus built into the computer- Fast, low power CPU (fanless computer)- Full HD screen (1920 x 1200 resolution)- Great battery life- Audio is great, just quiet- Linux apps available from within ChromeOS- Keyboard has good travel, very comfortable to type- Trackpad is a good size and is responsiveCons:- No backlit keyboard (some chromebooks in this price range have them)- Can't install any kind of Windows or Mac programs- Will not be able to play computer games, but it can play mobile games from androidProcessor:The processor in this unit is an intel core m3-7y30. To me, this is one of the best processors you can ask for in a Chromebook, but can be underpowered in a Windows laptop. The two specs I feel are most important are 4.5 W TDP and 1.0 ghz - 2.6 ghz clock speed.In layman's terms, this processor has extremely low power requirements which sips power and is able to increase its clock speed high enough to get tasks done. This chip can also hyperthread, basically making it more efficient per core and increasing speed as well.  Because of this low power state, the processor doesn't heat up too much and the computer doesn't need a fan.  The computer makes no noise.  I've noticed zero lag at all, even using the stylus.  This thing is overpowered for most tasks Chrome OS needs. It's a great balance between power needed vs maximizing battery life.To give you an idea on price, this processor's MSRP is $280.  Kind of already covers half of the price of the computer already.Screen:Incredible considering the wide viewing angles, I can see the screen from every angle possible. My old Acer c720 has the worst screen imaginable with a very narrow, low resolution display.  This thing is just as nice as a ""retina"" display in any macbook.Battery:As stated earlier, the M3 processor doesn't use much power compared to other processors, the lack of a fan also saves a lot of power.running a crosh battery test, the rate of decline without running anything is about 1% in 300 seconds, or about 12% an hour.  So I would say best case scenario, 8 - 8.3 hours of battery life.  This is good, not the best, but certainly good enough for me.  I got 3 days of solid use before I needed a new charge.  In comparison, my acer c720 sipped about 1.25% every 300 seconds, or had around 6.7 hours of battery life.  It is older and the CPU's are different, but overall it's significantly better.Audio:Great for a laptop.  Audio has good dynamic range, just no bass.  These are solid speakers and it feels premium, just not nearly as premium as a macbook for instance.Chrome OS:When you buy a Chromebook, you should primarily be using it for web browsing and simple tasks.  If you're tied into google's ecosystem it can do much more. On the other hand, if you're tied into Apple's ecosystem it can be a challenge to use.Chrome OS can't run computer programs built for Windows or Mac, such as microsoft office and photoshop. You can use an online suite of office or the android apps, but they aren‚Äôt the same. Setting up a wired printer can be confusing.  Downloading word documents may change the way they look when opened with google docs. Conversely, saving things from google docs to word format may also mess up the formatting, issues I wish would get polished out in the future.Overall, I think chromebooks are absolutely ready for widespread use.  Chrome OS is much more secure than both Windows and Mac's, the fact that you hardly ever download anything keeps the computer fast and secure.  The lightweight OS absolutely flies, for everyday tasks it's much faster than Windows or OS X and you'll notice a difference right away.Linux Programs:Back in the day (6 years ago), you had to sideload a linux OS in order to use linux apps. It worked but was clunky and made it much harder to keep linux up to date.  Plus it took up valuable space on the chromebook and you had to switch OS' completely in order to use them.Today, ChromeOS has a linux virtual machine built into it, and you're able to pull apps from the linux database directly into ChromeOS and run apps.  This is absolutely amazing to me, and I'm not sure when google decided to do this, but it basically makes ChromeOS a near complete machine with much lower limitations.  This gives you access to good program alternatives to photoshop and microsoft office, especially if you need something that does a little bit more than what google apps can do.  This is by no means as nice or complete as Windows or Mac as it still requires knowledge to do it properly and keep it up to date, but it's free and open source, and I think it's important to support that idea.  Linux and Android are the two most popular open source platforms, there's a lot of things you can do with both of them and it's great having both available within Chrome OS.Tablet:This is where ChromeOS is heading towards, so I wouldn't recommend getting a chromebook that isn't convertible at this point.  It's nice to have and makes it able to run android apps.Apps that would be useful on a chromebook would be anything that can take notes and take advantage of a stylus.  It's good for annotating powerpoints, drawing, or taking school notes if you enjoy writing over typing.  Everything else is just gimmicky, but It's still amazing to have an ability to flip the thing around and have a high resolution tablet available.xe520qab vs xe521qab:When I purchased this chromebook, a manufacturer sent me the 521 by mistake, so to get the lower price I had to return it and get the 520.  Amazon unfortunately wasn't able to price match.  I took pictures so everyone can see the difference.The 521 is simply nicer.  It has a darker body, metal keyboard deck, smooth edges; it just feels much better and more expensive. It's rounder in most places, tablet mode feels smoother and better when holding it.  The only two thing I like about the 520 is how it looks when it's closed and it feels better when opening it. The sharp edges are nice and clean, but the plastic keyboard deck just isn‚Äôt as comfortable.If you can find the xe521qab for the same price as the xe520qab, I'd pick the 521 in a heartbeat.  Other than that you're getting the exact same thing.  Both are fantastic computers and I'm sure anybody would be happier with either pick.$450 is an absolute steal for either of these computers.

  This is really a high quality machine. The price I paid almost reflected that quality, but I snagged it when an incredible deal was running. The m3 processor is more than enough power to do regular tasks that anyone does online plus all the productivity work that is needed in a workplace. My wife is a teacher and this was purchased for her, so most of this feedback is from what she's said as she's used it.First, let's talk about the display. It really is a beautiful display with accurate-enough colors. It gets a little over-saturated in some situations and under-saturated in others, creating some awkward hue on backgrounds of darker movies or webpages. But those are only noticeable while objects are moving (or when you're scrolling) and there's a lot of action on the screen. It gets bright enough for most situations and in the previous Pro model I wondered why it got as bright as it did. Watching reviews it seemed like you almost don't need to use a lamp to lighten a room, just turn the display face up and turn it up; that should be plenty to light an entire bedroom.Second is the quality of the material. The device feels like a brushed aluminum or other metal material with some plastic in some places. This is about right for the price, considering an even better quality of material would get you easily spending $900+. The keyboard feels fantastic and the touchscreen hasn't had a single hiccup yet after about 2 months of use.Third, let's talk about functionality. And, before we begin, let's remember this is a Chromebook. This wasn't purchased to play the latest games or sync with Microsoft or Apple services. It's a Samsung product running a Google operating system, meaning that it's meant to work with Google services. That said, it works wonderfully for Google Drive (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). This item is used almost exclusively to do lesson planning, grading, research, and other tasks that a teacher would do. For that, it's perfect. The only real issues we've had entail poor web design and a lack of websites switching to HTML5 instead of Flash.All in all, if you're wanting the performance of a Google Pixelbook and similar functionality then you won't be disappointed. If you want to get a loved one a computer that will really allow them to use the Internet without too much worry about viruses, then you're making a good purchase. If you're intending to get a laptop that can run Android apps without too much of a ""herky jerky"" experience, then you're making a good purchase. If you're wanting a computer that can run Photoshop, render 4K videos, or anything like that, then you're better off with other products.

  Best bang-for-your-buck Chromebook, with the beauty of a high-end yet overly priced Samsung, Asus, or Pixelbook. This little book is perfect in almost every way.In general, this Chromebook is perfect for what I bought it for: work-related tasks on the web, surfing the web, using Google Docs to type up documents & write lyrics for songs, and organizing thoughts and ideas into productivity apps and jotting down tasks in my Microsoft To-Do list app.  This Chromebook is lightning fast in powering up, connecting to WiFi & Bluetooth, and opening apps & browsers.The Screen size is non-jeopardizing; large enough for a functional workspace, but small enough to easily store away in a backpack. Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you're trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It's quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It's back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you're used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don't have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn't been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn't completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.

  Revised - 3/9/21As others have complained, the right hinge for the monitor is defective. I can't open/close the laptop unless I do it very slow using two hands so the monitor would not break. From what all are saying I guess I am SOL. I will contact Lenovo none the less to see if the will fix this.Revised - 9/30/20I must apologize to Lenovo. The issues I was facing was from my own doing. I forgot that I had set the OS to dev mode sometime ago and that was causing the device to act up. After setting the OS back to standard mode, it is running smoothly not freezing once.  All our headache went away.  Back to 5 stars!Revised - 9/24/20Stay AWAY!! Now the sound is going away during my daughter's virtual class.  We need to restart the device in order to get the sound back.  I would stay away from this device if you need something for school.  Our first Chromebook so not sure if this is normal for Chromebook.  Very dissapointed to say the least.Revised - 9/23/20Our device is starting to freeze daily and needing restart.  This is extremely frustrating for my 4th grade daughter when learning virtually.  It is not like she has too many files or apps open so I'm down grading this to three stars.With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14"" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3"" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We'll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I'm still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it's not that difficult.  It's no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of usÔºöÔºâ

  After six months of use the right hinge broke and started flexing the screen out.Looks like a bad design. Lenovo repair has you fill out a repair ticket but no info as where to send it, RMA or any other info.I have laptops that are over four years old and dont have any problems with hinges.*UPDATE* Lenovo fixed the hinge but broke the covers in the processes. Looks like they used a crowbar to pry them off. Took three months to get the unit back.  I would look at the Acer Spin over this.

  I've used quite a few Chromebooks before (Samsung, Pixelbook, Acer, HP). This time I wanted something that had a 14"" Full HD screen and an Intel Core i3+ processor (main for my children to use), but also wanted something that was snappy.For $400, this Chromebook has been impressive and has a solid build and is fairly lightweight.- Keyboard is great with keys nicely placed.- The HD touchscreen is sharp- The unit performs well with a moderate amount of tabs open, streaming two Youtube videos is no problem.- The flip screen is a nice touch- There's a good # of ports as well (dual USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, mini-SD card slot)- The webcam is great for video conferencing (even comes with a neat built-in webcam cover ).- Installing apps from the Google Play store was simple enough.It is a great Chromebook this price point!

  What can I say it‚Äôs just as good as I thought it would be. It‚Äôs well made and very fast! My other laptop that runs windows 10 has a i7, 8GB of ram, and a SSD. This feels just as fast (or faster) for half the price and better portability.

  Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back.

  Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I‚Äôm putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won‚Äôt make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again.

  Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn‚Äôt as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. ‚Äì Happy Mommy!

  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it! Shipping was very fast, and the customer service I received from HALF TIME was executive level. I would recommend this machine for anyone doing lite gaming, or any schoolwork.

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install. Everything is working as intended. I would recommend This Laptop. I like the auto on feature and the 4 digit pin login, makes it easy to get to work.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

"2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Intel Processor (13-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray",NA,5.0,"
  I bought this MacBook as I needed a well built (long lasting), fast, compact laptop that can handle day to day tasks in addition to creative work down the road (I am trying to get into Photography and Video Editing). This laptop checked everything off my list.In addition, I wanted a laptop that can seamlessly sync with my phone (iPhone 11 Pro). I love that I can answer calls, respond to texts, and read emails between all of my devices automatically without having to really set anything up or picking up my phone. The screen is also one of the best to look at in my opinion.I briefly had the 2019 entry level model of the MacBook Pro 13 with 2 ports but I quickly returned it as the 2 ports where quite limiting, I wasn't satisfied with the performance, and the butterfly keyboard was not my favorite and gave me anxiety. I am glad I waited a bit longer for this refresh before going for the higher end model as I am actually saving money as I did not have to purchase upgrades to get the 16 gigs of ram I wanted and I also get twice the storage as well which means I don't have to buy an external SSD, until I am much closer to starting creative work.So far I am very impressed with the MacBook Pro and it is so far my favorite laptop to date solely because it works so well with other gadgets I have. The only thing I could nitpick is it still feels expensive for the specs but you get what you pay for, this is a sturdy/premium feeling laptop and blows away any of the laptops I have purchased in the past that feel cheap. If I run into any issues I will update my review but I can't wait to dive in further.

  This is my first mac computer and coming from windows based computers this thing is amazing. I don't think ill ever go back to a windows pc. As with all apple products the quality and feel is the best. As for the computer itself it arrived in perfect condition and a day early. The new 2020 13"" works flawless absolutely zero issues with setup and initial operation as is expected with the apple premium paid. If you're debating on switching to macbook pro or upgrading your older macbook I don't think you'll be disappointed.

  Compared to laptop PCs I've owned, the battery life on this is terrible. I have to charge it a couple times throughout the day (I'm not even a ""power user""). Other than that, it seems to work okay. It's NOT as fast as I thought it would be, coming from using a 3-year old Dell XPS 13. I thought this would be so much faster than that, but it's only a minor noticeable difference. Not sure it's worth the price, since a PC with similar (or better) specs can be had for less money. There have also been issues with the ambient light switching between blue to ambient-- that's annoying (a quick online search will show that others have had this issue too). Also, when I try to update some apps it says, """"...cannot be updated because it was refunded or purchased with a different Apple ID"" -- maybe this was a returned machine? If so, that's not good either. IDK.

  This is first time I am posting review and I am very frustrated with amazon. Actually I am prime member since 2016 and I but almost every week from amazon. This is the first time i am very disappointed. Package arrived 1 week delay than guaranteed delivered date by UPS. I ordered new macbook with 16 gb ram and 1tb ssd but received 8gb ram and 256 ssd probably old released macbook. I opened laptop about 40 minutes and setup all necessary steps and it just blinked few times and shutdown automatically and didn't turn on back, I put laptop in charge but it didn't response anything.  I called to amazon technical support and one gentleman tried to help me out but didn't work and he connected call to apple store with export and finally that man asked me serial number and after checking serial number, he said it's not 2020 16gb ram, 1tb ssd laptop, than I checked laptop box and it said 8gb ram, 256 gb ssd.Because of covid 19, my all classes is in online so I tried to work whatever I got but it even didn't turn on. It's so frustrating. Finally I decided to return it and get windows from best buy.

  This review has to do with Amazon‚Äôs customer service during my entire experience with returning this laptop. Safe yourself the trouble purchase directly through apple and save your self the money and headache . I returned the laptop since it did this weird glitching twice and for a brand new laptop I did not feel that was a good sign so I returned it ....... then the nightmare started. After two week I called because I did not receive any correspondence. I called and found out the laptop was received a week earlier . The agent said they were testing the item , which I understand it‚Äôs a more expensive item and they have their procedures. I called back a week later and the agent was like oh that‚Äôs weird I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt release the funds so he went ahead and did it and then explained that because it was a ‚Äúlarge amount‚Äù it would have to be in three releases.... $1700 for Amazon is pocket change . But I was like whatever as long as I get my money back . Now here i am a month later on the phone as I type this STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK!!! BUY YOUR APPLE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM APPLE YOUVE BEEN WARNED !

  As a long time Mac User, my old macbook is still holding up pretty well! I was expecting to upgrade to the rumored 14 inch Macbook Pro, but it did come.After window shopping a lot of PC Laptops, especially Dell XPS, I am still convinced making right choice buying this once I open the package. Apple still delivers the best quality product!PC vs. Mac?PC may seems offering better value, they are NOT stable, after 2 years usage, it would comes with millions of glitches.Mac = STABLE, No Hassle, functioning good for years!

  I bought 2 of these computers for my kids for virtual learning.  One works great, the other started having problems just 1-2 weeks after school started.  I tried to return/exchange at that time and I was connected with HP support.  HP support assured me this was a one time issue and not to return, but to troubleshoot.  I troubleshooted for about 2 hours and the problem appeared to be fixed.  But now, 3 weeks later (and now out of the ""return period""), and the same issue happening, plus it will not start up at all.  Now I cannot return and HP is requesting $$ for me to ship to them so they can fix it.  Extremely disappointed.

  Great little computer, I have only had it for 4 days, but so far so good. I purchased this for my son who will be doing remote learning when school starts back up next month. The set up was easy, the computer talks you through the whole process if you allow it to by selecting the voice prompt. My son loves it, especially the blue metallic color, its small but for an elementary school student, its perfect. Now the only question is will it last, I did get the warranty, just in case.

  This laptop wasn't what I expected but it's functional. It has very little storage space so an external drive is a must unless you rely on storing in a cloud. Did not have room to install alot of the applications I use daily, like the Microsoft Office suite or Gmail. The windows system on it was very hard to manage making it impossible to install what you need without going through Microsoft Office store and getting a knock-off version of the app you really want so it was a bit of a nuisance.  Did not have the ports that I need for an Ethernet hookup. Even though it has wireless capability, I like the option to connect when the WiFi is not strong. I would recommend this for small children as a starter laptop.

  Heck, dollar for dollar this is the GAMING rig to beat.Item of Note:There IS a 2.5‚Äù hard drive caddy/cable with this model. Also the 2nd M.2 slot does show up if you put a NVME in there (not sure about SATA m.2 as I didn‚Äôt have one to test). It is standard 80mm size, same as the main slot, and seems to have extra room above/below it so I believe something double sided would fit, as would something with a SMALL heatsink on top (like say the Adata Swordfish one).Screen:Most of the other gaming laptops in the $750-1100 range have dim ~250 nit screens with awful <50% color gamuts. This one, 300nit rated (~330 actual based on reviews) 144hz and 100% srgb. It is striking, you won‚Äôt find a screen like this in this price range elsewhere.Power:Then you have a 8c/16t 4800H processor, which netted just under 4700 on Cinebench R20 in Performance Mode. For reference, my desktop running a Ryzen 3700X 8c/16t scores between 4600 and 4800 depending on background software and performance settings.Memory:The ram is ideal, 3200mhz, 16gb, you don‚Äôt want any less because that‚Äôs the lower limit for gaming and productivity, and you don‚Äôt want any more because each 8gb is about 3watts of power consumption. Not sure if it supports 32gb, I can‚Äôt see 16gb being the limit but the Lenovo Support responders in Q&A here seem to think it is.Battery.:It would be nice if they had any prebuilt options with the 80wh version, but they don‚Äôt, and I took a star off for that. Most of us would gladly pay an extra $50+ for that option. And I don‚Äôt feel like waiting 5+ weeks (2 months? 3?) for a custom one just to get it. That being said, with proper settings this 60wh can be sufficient.*Quiet Mode (fn+q until power led turns blue)*Battery Save mode on (click on battery icon, slide all the way to left)*Hybrid Mode on (this is ESSENTIAL, it shuts off the dedicated graphics card when not needed)*In Advanced Power Settings, adjust all of the AMD, Wireless, etc settings to their most ‚Äòbattery saving‚Äô optionDoing all that I‚Äôm getting over 5 hours browsing the internet, longer if I have the internet open and am mostly working in excel or word (ie: normal school work/reports for office/etc). For instance, editting this review in the Amazon window, 4.1 hours remaining w/ 55% (7.5 hours total est). 7-8 hours watching Youtube @720p in Edge. Brightness at whatever battery saver drops it to when it‚Äôs on high to begin with. I intend on trying to swap in an 80wh when the parts are available.Build quality:The fit/finish and overall feel of the unit hits above its price point. The keyboard is exceptional for productivity, aside from the slightly cramped numpad. The touchpad is responsive. The rear I/O ports are great for desktop duty. But lets be real, Lenovo doesn‚Äôt exactly have a great reputation when it comes to customer service and turnaround times for repairs. None of the laptop manufacturers do though really, save Apple. My last Lenovo, a Y700, lasted over 5 years. I figure, get it, do some stress testing on the processor/GPU (Cinebench, Furmark), watch some movies and do some white/black backgrounds to check for dead pixels, and cross your fingers. To extend warranty through them is $50/100/175 for 1/2/3 extra years respectively, I personally am planning at least the $50 for an extra year.Heat:There is one drawback, this thing gets hot. I was expecting better thermals as I tested out a Legion 5 with the 4600H + 1650ti combo a while back. I would say this one runs ~5c average hotter across the board, and will spike to 95-100C+ if you‚Äôre doing something intense like Cinebench or Flight Sim 2020. In Flight Sim, average CPU temps over a 20 min flight were ~76c, CPU Die avg was ~85C. Temps are lower playing less demanding games, and even normally demanding games like AC Origins CPU avg was low 70‚Äôs, so not terrible. I spent some time looking into this, and apparently these hopped up gaming laptops hitting 90-100C is ‚Äòokay‚Äô, even if I don‚Äôt really like or trust it. Also, the only option I know of that actually runs cooler than this with similar hardware is the Omen 15 AMD, so if temps are a priority may want to check that platform out. The Asus Tuf‚Äôs are as hot if not hotter, and the Dell G5 SE is a small portable sun. However, you do get something for this heat, the aforementioned Cinebench scores blow the competition out of the water, I still can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs on par with my desktop processor.Final Thoughts:This thing runs warm, looks good (if you like the aesthetic), has a phenomenal spec sheet for the price, and has best in class screen for a non special-order low-mid budget prebuilt. Would recommend, with the one slight caveat regarding heat.

  This laptop is good, performance, design, screen and fast.However, something is wrong.First of all, I always check hard disk whenever I buy a laptop since I sometimes experienced receiving used laptop instead of new. It happened to this laptop. I check hard disk and it was turned on 208 times before.It might be program error but as far as I know, they are pretty accurate(crystal disk info) It looks new but might be not. Maybe I am unlucky. I will post another review later after I investigate more.update 1.So, My purchase date and warranty start date are different.Usually, warranty starts when I first install Windows and turn on laptop first time.This laptop had started warranty about more than 1 month ago, it doesn't any make sense to me.I talked about it with Amazon customer service and what they said is 'just return it',So disappointing so far.

  Edit 2: have been using the laptop for few month. No issues at all. Love it. Will move it back to 4 stars..........Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review. After 10 days, this vertical line appeared and it's constant through all applications, even in Bios. Meaning this is a hardware defect. Will change my review to one star for poor quality control. I have returned the laptop and Amazon honored 30 day return window. The new units doesn't have this line. Will see if the same problems happens in the next few weeks.............................If you're not willing wait to RTX 3000. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. The build quality is good. Fan is quite and powerful. Love it.I've been using the laptop now for a week. It's much better than what I thought. Super quite when you need it be quite. Powerful when you need it to be powerful. I actually returned the Helios 300, which I bough for 999 as well on a deal. Helios 300 has RTX 2060 which is not so different from 1660 Ti (Don't let them fool you). .With helios noise at idle is just unbearable, Intel heat is ridiculous as well and the build quality doesn't come close Legion 5.  Legion 5 Beats it at all the way. .

  I really like the new design. It looks like a workstation more than a gaming laptop!I'm gonna try and keep this short:PROS:- build quality is excellent,- specs are insane,- 2.5kg and the dimensions make it really portable,- screen is amazing! 144Hz and 300nits.- Ryzen 7 4800H...- GTX 1660ti is great for video editing and gaming!- laptop feels premium!CONS:- speakers are mediocre. Volume is decent but the sound quality is ok.-battery is really bad...less that 4 hours.- there is no international warranty (now this is Lenovo fault)!To be honest, this laptop is best buy at this price (999$). I'm really glad I bought it!Edit:There is a lot of problems with Linux...I actually thought Lenovo was the best with open source drivers and support for Linux...I was wrong.I can't run Linux, I can't have warranty in my own country, I can't have normal battery life. I guess I'll return it!Edit 2:I have random freezes. It just stops responding while doing random stuff. Returning it!

"Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 4GB RAM 32GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K01US",$186.05,2.0,"
  About Me/ExpectationsI purchased this chromebook after having a wonderful experience with the Samsung Chromebook 3. I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram‚ÄîI had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can‚Äôt do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn‚Äôt had a chromebook or hasn‚Äôt updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn‚Äôt wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it‚Äôs far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine‚Äîthis one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn‚Äôt because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn‚Äôt because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn‚Äôt break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don‚Äôt hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It‚Äôs so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like‚ÄîI did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn‚Äôt been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn‚Äôt worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don‚Äôt select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product.

  I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.

  This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life. The display is not as good as those laptops costing 2 to 4 times as much but it is fine for daily use and I don't find it be a problem even when using it for long periods of time.

  This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!

  Listen, this is a sub $300 Chromebook‚Äî they had to cut costs somewhere. Is the TN panel great? No. But this laptop cost me $302 with tax, has 6gb of RAM and 64gb of storage, will be updated at least until 2026,  also does what I need it to do (homework/writing). I have the Samsung Chrome book 3 too, and the 4 is a nice upgrade. This is a light laptop with a small footprint. so I can easily carry it back and forth to campus. Also, the new design is freaking sexy. Probably my favorite laptop of all time.

  I ordered this for my wife. It is perfect for her to surf the Internet and check email quickly. As others have said, the screen could be better. The screen is not good when viewed at from an angle. But then, it's an inexpensive item. It's the first Chromebook I've ever purchased. The speed is great. It boots almost instantly. It has great battery life. It is very light. The keyboard is responsive. It has to USB 3.0 ports and bluetooth. I connected an inexpensive bluetooth mouse to the system without a problem. My wife could not be happier.

  This product worked the first day for 15 min.  We charged it over night.  It now turns on for 1 sec. and then turns off immediately!  I am so upset.  This was a gift for my son so that he could do schoolwork on it.  What a waste of money.  I am trying to return it and there is no way to do it

  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  The laptop is okay.. it functions well enough for my kids online school. However we‚Äôve had 2 of the 3 charger cords stop working and customer service was not helpful at all.
