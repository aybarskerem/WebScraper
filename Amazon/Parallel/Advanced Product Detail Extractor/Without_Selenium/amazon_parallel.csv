0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray",NA,5.0,"
  I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.

  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.

  I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.

  I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

  Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However, I would say something different.For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip, I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it's useless).Secondly, would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface, the MacBook turns off itself. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.Also, I miss the MagSafe...

  I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

  Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon

  I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.

  UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.

  The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.

  Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.

  Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.

  No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.

  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!

  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.

  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?

  After passing off last year's model to my brother (3500U Flex 14), I got this as soon as I saw it posted up on Reddit. I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since.Let's get the rundown here.- Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU- Radeon Vega 6 graphics- 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop)- 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD- 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!)Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but it opens up almost all the way with one hand (tilts towards the end). The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more ""premium."" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2.I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W).The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a ""worst case"" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all!Camera is acceptable. Nothing to write home about, but it'll work well enough for video calls. Battery is excellent - while browsing the web and watching videos, I have been consistently draining 10% per hour of use! That 10 hour claim from Lenovo seems pretty spot on.Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier:- 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7- Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (4700U option is now available in some places)- Metal constructionI'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing.

  ***UPDATE 3 - 12/2/20 - Have had several issues recently and wanted to pass along how I resolved them.  Issue #1 was trying to boot up the computer after 12 hours of sleep and being unable to get the computer to turn on at all.  Didn't matter if it was plugged in or not.  The battery was fully charged.  I tried holding the power button.  No go, laptop was dead.  As a final attempt before sending it in for service, I pulled off the bottom cover of the laptop and disconnected the battery cable for several minutes.  I plugged it back in, pressed the power button,and the laptop booted normally.  Everything worked fine after that and I haven't had the issue since.  Issue #2 was noticing the laptop was no longer charging when connected to the USB-C charger.  Even the charging LED wouldn't come on.  The fix was to shut down the computer completely, then hold the power button for 20-40 seconds.  The charge light came on and the laptop started charging again.**UPDATE 2 - 7/2/20 - Resolved an audio stuttering issue by turning off Dolby Audio processing in the Dolby app.***UPDATE - 6/10/20 - Dropping a star.  Sent original back due to crashing issues when waking from sleep.  Wifi also dropped occasionally and had trouble reconnecting after sleep.  New unit seems to work fine.  Also replaced wireless card with Intel AX200 (need torx T5 bit to remove bottom panel).  Much faster and no dropped connections.  Still really like the laptop (and Amazon's return policy).*Original Review:Overall usability – Everything about the laptop feels well-built and like it should cost hundreds more.  Incredibly fast processor, especially given the 15W TDP.  The AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors (7nm Zen 2) have really improved the thermals and efficiency to the same level as Intel (or better).  Between the 6 core processor and the  PCIe NVMe SSD the laptop flies.  Nothing I’ve thrown at it has been able to slow it down or make it stutter.  Benchmarks comparable to my HP desktop with i7-7700 (if in best performance mode while plugged in).  Applications open instantly in most cases.  Comes out of short-term sleep instantly.  Nice webcam privacy cover.  Fingerprint reader is best I’ve used in terms of accuracy and speed.  Fans are quiet under normal loads and a low non-annoying whirring when the GPU/CPU is taxed.Exterior – Very light weight (but not cheap feeling) and nice sturdy build.  Feels like it will hold up well.  Keyboard back-light adjustable.  Plenty of ports.  Hinges also feel built to last.Touchscreen – Sensitive and good feel (though I prefer matte to glossy).  Works well with included pen.Bloatware – Almost none (uninstalled Skype).Speakers – Above average for price range.  Not especially tinny sounding like cheaper laptops.  Don’t expect bass though.  The included Dolby equalizer software can help improve the sound if you don’t mind experimenting.  Side-mounted front-facing speakers are well placed.Screen – Brightness OK for indoor use, but I plan to run it at 90% brightness even on battery because anything less is too dim.  Colors are bright.  No noticeable back light bleed.Battery life – Above average for price range.  Really quite impressive.  Could easily last half to three-quarters of the stated 10 hours depending on the conditions (clearly not doing anything processor or graphics intensive for the duration, but web browsing, office work, or video viewing).Wireless/Bluetooth – Some occasional random disconnects and trouble connecting after sleep, likely due to Realtek wireless card.  Average speeds on my 5GHz home network.Keyboard/Trackpad – High quality feel.  You can tell when you’ve hit a key unlike cheaper laptops.  Miss the numpad, but knew it didn’t have one before I ordered.  Trackpad not over-sensitive or unresponsive.  Good balance, but still prefer a mouse.Graphics/Gaming – Played Two-Point Hospital on Steam at 1080p very high graphics setting.  Not very graphics intensive or an FPS, but the game is newer and frame-rate didn’t drop below 30 in game.  Game load times are ridiculously fast.Downsides – Mediocre webcam.  Soldered RAM (not a big deal w/16 GB, but if it goes bad it is a big problem).  Screen may not be bright enough for outdoor use and the glossy coating leads to reflections/glare when viewing from an angle.  Wireless card not great.  Stories of poor tech support (though, admittedly I’ve never interacted with them).**Don’t forget to create your USB backup drive from the Lenovo website for crashes/re-installs.  Or have the Windows 10 ISO handy on a USB drive and download the drivers/apps from the website.

   For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the ""Lenovo Representative"" knows nothing about their product. Yes, it has dual channel 16GB RAM @ 3200mhz, it ships with the Lenovo pencil included. Screen is only @ 250 nits, but I wouldn't call it a deal breaker unless you plan to use it outdoors a lot. Plastic machine but nothing feels cheap. The hinge is a little loose to my taste, the touchpad is a little shaky. Other than those, everything fits my needs. Very satisfying first day of use.Update: the audio starts to cutoff randomly from the 2nd day, all drivers and windows updates and BIOS are up to date. I contacted both Amazon and Lenovo tech support, after a remote session, the problem persists. Then I noticed the trackpad is shaky and sticky ( see video).So overall it's a nice product, but quality control can be a problem.

  The 1 star is for the poor quality control by Acer.I received the laptop and immediately started to set it up. Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer’s quality control.I can’t really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start. I’m hoping that is the only issue with the machine as most reviews I’ve read about the Nitro 5 are positive.Update: It has been 22 days since I received the brand new laptop from Amazon. Acer repair has had the laptop for 14 days now and I still have not received any info about the status of my case other than it is still being repaired.  I am not happy about having to wait 3+ weeks to have a brand new working laptop.

  I included potential solutions to the problems I had in the cons section.Pros:-slim size, easy to take on the go-cheap-open slots inside to upgrade componentsCons (that I found solutions to):-loud fans, combined with poor audio quality. The built in speaker volume needs to be turned up pretty high to hear over the fan noise. The fan noise also means you should leave your mic on push to talk rather than open during online games, otherwise your poor teammates will have to listen to it constantly. Good news is there is blue tooth, so I suggest connecting external speakers or headphones instead.-hot CPU. Make sure your battery settings are on ""better performance"" rather than ""best performance"", regardless of if it's plugged in or not. Otherwise, the CPU hits 90 C. Better to have less performance or learn to undervolt if you want the laptop to last very long.-wrong GPU used during gaming. If you have really bad performance, it could be that the laptop is using the Intel GPU rather than the GTX 1650. Go into NVIDIA Control Panel, and under ""manage 3D settings"" and ""global settings"", switch preferred graphics processor to ""high-performance NVIDIA processor"" rather than auto.-laptop suddenly restarts within seconds of booting up, when not plugged into power. For me, going into startup apps and turning off ""Delayed Launcher"" fixed this.-not enough space, and plenty of bloatware to make it worse. Definitely invest in at least 1TB of additional storage. 256 GB is only enough space for two or three games, unless you only play games from the 90's.Cons (without solutions I could find):-yellowish smudges at the top of the screen, only visible though when the screen is black-the touch pad is terrible. It's on the left for some reason, so both your hands have to be crammed left to use them during games. Not an issue if you use controllers or a mouse. Also, the mouse is very delayed and floats around. Tried updating drivers but nothing works, it's super laggy most of the time!-keyboard lights only turn on when a key is pressed and automatically turn off after 30 seconds. There is no way to leave them on, which sucks when you're using it in the dark. There are forums complaining about this, and the company refuses to add the feature to leave them on even though many people are requesting the option.-short battery life. This doesn't bother me because I view gaming laptops more like transportable desktops, but keep in mind that this will not last you very long if you want to play on the bus or plane.

  The best laptop a 10 year old “gamer girl” could ask for! I’m blown away at how nice this laptop is, especially for the price.NOTE : External hard drive will need to be purchased separately though if you’re wanting to run more than two games on it, simply because it doesn’t have a large enough internal drive to run more than that.

  I want to point out ive only had it a week and will update if anything changes about my review. Overall, before I get into details, I am very satisfied with this laptop and it’s performance.The pricing as what I bought was 1418.99$ for the intel i7-10750H with the rtx 3060 and 500G m.2. The availability of laptops has been pretty bad and I feel I wasn’t overcharged for the current market.Pros:Rtx 3060 is a little better than imagined. It is the 80W variant but will turbo up to 100W with spikes over 115W very well.The turbo button above the keyboard is actually more useful than I would have expected. In cyberpunk at max settings with medium ray tracing it’s an easily playable 55 FPS and turbo activated averages around 5fps or more higher even in the worst areas.Temperatures at first freaked me out cause I saw spikes over 90C. But I found it was only temporary and the average with a decent fan curve was around 69 to 75C on both cpu and gpu.Predator sense software built in is useful. But I still downloaded MSI afterburner for in game over lay though.Cons:Fans get pretty loud when you activate turbo. So if you got a decent headset and nobody around you it won’t bother you. But if your around people they will think you have a jet engine running. But even without turbo mode you get more than playable frame-rates in every game I’ve played. Most newer titles like cyberpunk and ValhallaBattery is whatever. It’s maybe an hr usage if you’re playing heavy games and 7 hrs if you keep power saver mode on and only use it for light work like google chrome or YouTube.Other aspects:Screen was nothing special. Not super bright but not excessively dark or glare issues. Keyboard is fine. Again, nothing special. It’s a laptop. Bloatware wasn’t too bad. Just uninstalled it all. But overall it is a quick responsive little laptop for easy gaming and even can do some work. I’m very satisfied because I’m a trucker on the road everyday and needed something a little more portable but still had performance to play the newer games without going to a 2 grand or more computer. I would recommend it to others.Edit: I forgot to say the pictures are without turbo and with turbo on 3D mark timespy score.

  ***EDIT*** ***The Pictures of the Laptop open are a before and after, It does have a WD SN730 Nvme M.2 Pci-e SSD but I also added a 250GB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe V-Nand M.2 Pci-e SSD I had laying around to the build and it's very very simple to take off and upgrade, just a few screws and pull from the back where the exhaust fans are located and it also has an extra Nvme Screw as well*** I build PCs on the side and have for years this laptop CAN DO IT ALL, it has a great CPU the Core i7-10750H with 6 cores and 12 threads which is plenty for modern gaming and 12Mb of Intel level 3 smart cache and it's paired with the BEASTLY NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6 laptop gpu, which is Overclockable with the touch of a button and has 3840 Cuda Cores and 30 2nd generation Ray Tracing cores also its running 336Gb/Sec on a 192 bit memory bus interface which runs at 14Gb/s and sits around 11 Teraflops of graphical power from a LAPTOP, think about that! I have pushed this thing to its limits Days Gone PC version that's just released on the 18th I can play MAXED OUT setting on everything and it never dipped below 90fps and my average was around 124-127fps, this thing is just as powerful as my RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Trio gpu in my one desktop, I own an RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 3080 but they're all Desktop Gpu's but it definitely gives the 2070 Super Desktop GPU some good competition without a doubt. And it's Ampere 8nm architecture so newest Nvidia technology compared to 12nm Turing architecture, and the screen is absolutely gorgeous playing day or night with a true IPS display running at 144Hz @ 3ms, if you want a SOLID GOOD LAPTOP FOR GAMING, this is it, the ACER Predator Helios 300 can't be beat and I own Asus/Origin/Dell etc etc laptops as well and nothing ever Beats my ACER LAPTOPS, and this beauty is made of a nice metal and sturdy plastic on certain parts but mostly metal and u can see the quality ACER put into this laptop, and yes the PREDATOR symbol on the screen lights up and its perfect for letting others know you mean business lol I recommend 100% for the bang for your buck! That's it that's all I got for ya

  I had it a week ago and tested lots of thing. I am quite satisfied with its design, build quality, and, of course, performance.I bought it for 1250$ on 14th April. It came with i7-10750h, rtx 3060, and 500G m.2. I bought it with discount and I think it is frequently on discount.Thermal impressed me the most for the laptop. When turbo mode is not activated, fans are not that loud and GPU temperature is around 70 degree and CPU temperature is around 78 degree in heavy games in performance mode. If you activate turbo mode temperatures decrease to 60 degree. Turbo mode also increase FPS a bit, but GPU power does not increase more than 90W. You can play every game easily with this laptop at high FPS for sure.Only bad thing is fans get really loud in turbo mode. If you have a decent headphone, so no problem. However, the sound is more like plane engine.Battery is not bad. It goes 1hr for gaming, but for light work it can go approximately 6hr. Screen is also good, it is 144hz and 15.6"" at 1080p. It is also matte and gorgeous, but fingerprint magnet. Overall laptop is fingerprint magnet.  Keyboard is also reassuring and used plastic and aluminum for all laptop are good-looking and solid.

  Honestly the system is exactly what I want. Simple gaming system I can travel with, the graphics card is better than other systems at the price, and I was able to use the internal M2 spot to install a 1TB drive. all in all Star Citizen, Doom, World of Warcraft and multiple other games are running great faster than my gaming desktop.Only downside is it is only 1080p but for the price & it is easy to overlook. and don't touch the screen it isn't touch screen.

  If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.The good.- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4"" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the ""happy medium"" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.""4 (now 16"") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.The Bad- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.If you're upgrading from the 13"" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.

  The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ...Yet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity.Now that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ?Apple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that.Lastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ....

  Edit: The prices change quite a bit, and Amazon doesn't do price-matching, so keep an eye out for that. There's a website that shows the lowest price for each configuration, so check that out first before buying. I ended up returning my i7 MBP to get the i9 because 512GB of space just isn't that much, and definitely wasn't enough for my purposes. Both are excellent machines and I'm waiting to see how hot the i9 gets under sustained load.I used to have a lot of apple products, with my last macbook being the 2012 13 and 15"" macbook pros. I ended up giving those to friends as I transitioned to a new windows-based laptop for college.7 years later, and I finally had a compelling reason to purchase the newest MBP: a normal keyboard, USB C, larger screen, and improved thermals. My main gripe with thin and light laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th gen) has been that their thermals are awful. My hands would burn up while typing, even after a good repaste and undervolt. It also didn't help that their screens were on the smaller side.I've had the new MBP for a few days now. I bought the base model i7, and while I'm enjoying it, I do wish I sprung for the i9 at the very least due to the 1TB of storage. I have handfuls of external storage, but it really gets annoying to have to go through different drives when storage fills up. I do use more storage than a typical user IMO, as I typically have Bootcamp installed along with different CAD programs, IDEs, datasets, etc. However, I'm sure the extra storage would be nice for anyone.So far, the transition has been great! My only issue so far has been the battery life - 10 to 11 hours is definitely a stretch, and I personally found myself running out of battery after 4-5 hours of heavy multi-tasking, fans at a constant 60% (basically inaudible in a packed starbucks), at full brightness, with a lot of external power-hungry peripherals. Honestly, that's not that bad!

  I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal.  It is  like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core.  Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy.  I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance).  The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year).  After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch.  The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage.  I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2.  I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen.  That would made it perfect for my needs.  It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.Overall, I would buy it again.[UPDATE 2-3-2021]I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm.  The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively.  I just added a screenshot.I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.EDIT:I replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S).  This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me.  Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues.  Really happy with it.  I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.

  For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get.This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great.If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable ""S mode"", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google ""disable S mode"" and you'll find the steps easy enough.64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks. The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. 😂ASUS is one of the best quality computer parts manufacturers around, so this also should last a good while. Overall, I definitely recommend this for your more basic computer needs.

  I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.PROS --Incredible Price to Performance RatioVery well built, with no cheap partsFull-size, comfortable keyboardSmall and lightweightGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatwareInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slotI could keep going... it's $200.CONS --No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)Some irksome viewing angle problemsMaddeningly little built in storageAlmost too little RAMI've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):Introduction (above)Weight & BuildKeyboard and TrackpadScreenBatteryPerformance (including Gaming)WebcamSpeakers & SoundSoftwareOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)ConclusionLinks to AccessoriesLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.With that being said, let me get into the details.WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.UPDATE: There's seems to be an issue with the screen calibration. Frequently, it will turn noticeably yellow, and by right clicking on the desktop and clicking 'display settings,' it seems to at least temporarily fix it. I believe very much this is a software issue, so it's unlikely you'll encounter it, but it would be interesting to know if others are encountering the same problem.BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.SPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.LINK TO ACCESSORIES - Some may find this helpful. These are subject to change - Amazon is always adding or removing their product offerings, so if one's not available, these should at least give you an idea of what to look for. But at the time of this writing, these are the accessories I purchased for it, and that all work.SD Card (256gb, $40) - Lots of storage to hold a small collection of movies, music, or pictures. Plenty fast enough.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCR3316/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Laptop Case ($12) - The laptop fits perfectly.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VVLE5CG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Microfiber Clothes ($8) - You can never have too many of these.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050R67U0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1Wireless Mouse ($16) - Oddly, the little LEDS in it aren't nearly as bright as advertised, but it's a great mouse. Good click, the scroll wheel is nice. And it has an option between Bluetooth or dongle. Charges off of USB, so no batteries needed.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085HR8VPM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1Messenger Bag ($32) - Fits the Laptop [in the case] like a glove. It's a little large, but it's stylish and has lots of pockets.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072PVTHR9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

  I haven't seen many reviews for this particular CPU/model. I have been using this laptop to work from home for about a week now, which means I keep it plugged in on my desk and on for 8+ hours a day while I work with spreadsheets and email clients. Numerous reviews for the i5-10210 CPU mentioned the terrible fan noise and low sound quality, but I haven't experienced either of those issues with i5-1035G1. The fan does turn on sometimes when I'm not heavily using the laptop, but it doesn't stay on long and it's not very loud. I play workout videos on the laptop and am very pleased with sound and video quality. For reference, I had an i3 Asus laptop for nine years before getting this one, so my standards are kind of low because my old one was so much heavier, clunkier, slower, etc. Nevertheless, this seems fantastic for what I need it to do, which is mainly to facilitate my work-from-home experience. Since it has only been a week my experience is limited, so if anything goes catastrophically wrong I will update my review. Fingers crossed...**EDIT**November 18, 2020: Still a great laptop. No issues!

  This is my third Acer laptop (other 2 are still functional) and after 2 weeks this has been a solid performer.  Performs well and with WiFi 6 I am getting superb speed using 5 GHz network.  Battery life has been good so far.  I will say that compared to my Aspire E laptop the keyboard is slimmer, and the number pad keys and functions keys are smaller but there is nice tactile feedback on the keys and the back lighting is nice.What has been difficult is getting proper information about configuration.  Like some other reviews, my laptop came with 1 8 GB memory stick rather than a 4 + 4 configuration.  So this laptop maxes out at only 16 GB of RAM, and you are limited to using only Kingston memory (per Acer and my own testing).  So that was a bit of a bummer.I was able to add a second SDD (I used WD Blue b/c of price) which is always a nice feature of the Acer laptops.  This was more difficult than my Aspire E laptops but still doable.  The trick is to remove the screw holding the Intel chip down so you can fully seat the connector.

  I needed a new laptop for my work from home setup, and this offered speed, Wi-Fi 6, fingerprint reader and a backlit keyboard for a good price. The system is upgradeable - I upgraded the M.2 SSD from the standard 256 GB to 1 TB for the operating system and applications, and I added a 1 TB SATA SSD for my data, since there is a expansion space for this additional drive, and the system provides an installation bracket and ribbon cable for that purpose.My only disappointment is that the specifications indicate that the system will support a maximum of 20 GB of RAM, and states that there is 4 GB on onboard RAM, with the rest of the RAM installed in an expansion slot that is accessible for upgrading. My system came with 8 GB of RAM, but all of it was in the module in the expansion slot, and so when I replaced it with a 16 GB module, that is the maximum amount of memory I can use with the system. It's still a great system, and 16 GB is more than adequate for my purposes. It's just that the published specifications lead you to believe you can host more RAM than the system is capable of hosting.

  Then Acer made me spend $50 to send it to them for replacement. Moral of the story - if you're gonna buy an Acer on Amazon, pay the extra money for the protection plan, or buy a better laptop than this one. I have zero expectations for this thing going forward.

  Really nice laptop. I needed a new laptop and compared to my 2 year old Dell this is so much nicer. Very smooth and fast performance. Feels and looks nice. Set up was pretty easy even for me which I’m not a computer geek or anything. So far I really like it and expect it to last a long time. Excellent build quality. I only wish it had a built in dvd/cd drive. They are getting hard to find in  laptops in this price range though. Highly recommend if you want a nice laptop at a decent price

  My old computer uses Windows 7 which (as we all know) is no longer supported. I've been looking for a new computer with Windows 10 and I liked the Acer Aspire 5 specs.A backlit keyboard is a dealbreaker for me and it has a nice one. I wish I could disable the time-out feature; it goes dark very quickly (which is annoying) but I only have to hit a key/spacebar to light it up again. Also, I cannot adjust the brightness of the backlit keyboard. I would prefer to be able to have the keyboard stay lit and to adjust the brightness (as with my older laptop) but those are not options here. I do like the feel of the keyboard and the fact that it has a numbers pad.The screen size is great. I like the image quality.Finding things on Windows 10 is not difficult and I've spent a lot of time today setting things up how I want them. I just noticed the default setting for the camera is ""Allow apps to access your camera"", which I turned off.The internal speakers have a nice sound. I have music playing now and I do not feel a need to plug in my external speakers to amplify it.Cannot address battery life yet as I am always near a power source so I just keep laptops plugged in.I buy devices to use for a long time (my last laptop is going on 8 years) and I plan on using this one for quite a while. For my personal use it should be more than adequate.

  I wasn't fully sure what to expect, I've never had a chromebook but really needed something that I could take with me on the go to work on my shop updates, work stuff, and school when that starts up. It's taking some getting used to but I'm loving it so far! Battery life is as expected, I left it on overnight and I still had a full battery the next morning. Touchscreen is responsive. Shipping was STUPID FAST, ordered it Saturday night and received it Monday out here butt-shuck nowhere, Wyoming. So, ya know, impressive. Definitely like a tablet with a keyboard, but it's so much better than any tablet I've used. I have a fire kindle (same thing as a tablet imo. One of those gifts you get and you're like ""ohhhhhhhh, thaaaaankkkkksssss....I'ma never use this. But thank you."" Obviously you never tell them that because that would be rude, so instead it sits in the bookcase with your hard copies collecting dust because you don't want to get rid of it and have them find out.) and -anyway- this thing blows it out of the park. Feels lightweight but sturdy at the same time, it's no little biiiish, it feels like it can hold it's own.

  I'm 72 and have been agonizing replacing my aging Asus laptop. Back and forth between a Chromebook or a laptop. Read reviews on the differences, threw a dart, and ordered this Chromebook. What a great decision. Opened it up, plugged it in and turned it on. Then answered a few questions and it synched with my Note8. I like to cook and can hardly wait to look up a recipe, tent it, and start creating.  I have very simple computer needs, email, banking, and, looking up recipes. For me this is a 5.

  Much faster and of course newer than my old Acer 15"" Chromebook, which was one of the first 15"" models they made and the only 15"" Chromebook on the market when I bought it. I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn't support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name.I'll start off by saying this thing feels really sturdy, built well in typical Acer fashion. But I'm kind of surprised with how big the bezels are, they easily could've put a bigger screen in the thing. The screen that is installed though is plenty bright enough for my use, and is perfectly sharp at a typical viewing distance with good viewing angles. The touchscreen is kind of flaky in my experience, but that could be a problem with the user since some touchscreens just don't like responding well to my fingers. Performance in typical use is perfectly fine, but don't expect to do much gaming as it doesn't have the power to run more intense Android games smoothly. WiFi is very fast and signal is excellent. The ports provided are great, and I love that it can be charged from either USB-C port. The keyboard feels pretty good and the trackpad is about what you'd expect on a device like this.Now where I am truly disappointed is in the fact that stylus support was removed from the last model of this system. I'm a bit of an artist and like to draw on occasion, even if it's just playing a round of Draw Something to fix my itch. I thought drawing on this with an Android app would be pretty nice compared to my Note phone. And another person had already asked if this system supported an active stylus, which Acer responded by saying yes. This thing absolutely does NOT support an active stylus. At least not an EMR one like you find in Samsung devices (S-Pen) or a Wacom stylus. I'm tempted to send this model back and order the older one since there doesn't seem to be much difference between the N3350 and N4020 CPUs.I'll also mention here that the indent for the second camera that goes above the keyboard for use in tablet mode is present, but there isn't a camera. I was unsure what this indent was for until I did some more reading online and found a review for a pre-release version of this system. That included the camera and stylus. Seems they changed their minds on both features but didn't bother to get rid of the indent.Long story short, it's a good little 2-in-1 but some design choices are odd for a device in 2020. Also many of the reviews out there are for the last model (N3350 CPU) or for pre-production test units that have features this thing actually doesn't have (stylus and second camera). Also look at the true reviews closely as this thing is offered with the Intel CPU (N4020), and AMD CPU, and a MediaTek CPU.

  Got this for elementary school children. I've never owned a chromebook so didn't know what to expect, but so far it has impressed me.  Easy to setup with a google account.  Also like how you can apply parental controls using google family.  As far as the device itself-- love the touchscreen.  My kids don't really use the flipped mode but i like that it is an option.  Very happy with my purchase.  Also, I didn't buy the extended protection but am now thinking I will.

  This is probably the best $400 Chromebook on the market right now.  Unfortunately, I had to return mine.  The display is a nice full HD 1920 x 1080 with bright crisp color.  The keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is large and responsive.  Browsing the web is very quick.  I benchmarked this machine with Octane 2 and got a score of around 12000.  Not bad for a Celeron.  So... why did I send it back.  The problem was that the Chromebook I received had two manufacturing flaws.  The case is aluminum which is great, but the bottom edge of my case had a sharp edge going all way around.  I think the aluminum case was a fraction of a millimeter too wide.  It wasn't sharp enough to cut, but it gave the Chromebook an unfinished feel.  The second problem was that the trackpad was loose.  It worked fine, but when you tapped (which you do a lot on Chromebooks), the trackpad rattled slightly.  I thought I could live with it, but the more I used it, the more crazy it made me.  Hopefully, these build problems were only on the Chromebook that I received and all the other Acer 514s do not have these issues.

  bought at $249.00 Respectable specs for price given current demand. Getting 8+ hours of battery life surfing web and watching YouTube. If you cant tell from pics. micro SD slot reader for media and volume rocker on side. your play store app compatibly will vary. please note that only about 20 GB of that storage is available for apps. if you are new to Chromebooks (or computers in general) this is more of a tablet+ than a full laptop replacement

  Taking a look at the specs of this laptop, you would expect it to be incredible, especially for this price point. Taking a look at the online reviews shows that the screen isn't the best, and it takes a few more hits, but even so it looks like an amazing deal. After using it, in my opinion it's worth the money, but not as fantastic as it appears.TLDR: Look at what you want in a laptop before buying this one. For me it works fine but there are a few key drawbacks that might affect different tasks you would want to use this laptop for.The PRO's+ Build Quality is fantastic, with sturdy metal and a keyboard I surprisingly quite enjoy using.+ Big PRO: The Ryzen 4700U processor is a beast, and the snappiest processor I've used. Productivity use such as coding, taking notes in class, running other professional programs like the Microsoft suite or Zoom are handled easily and perfectly.+ Big PRO: A 512GB SSD for this price is incredible! And it's even a really good SSD at that.The CON's- The screen is as bad as they say, even after calibration. It's only slightly better than my old laptop I bought for $350 a few years ago. However, as someone who doesn't use the laptop for video editing, it's not a big issue for me, but everything does look more green/blue than it should.- I've had software problems with this laptop that I would not have expected from a pre-built laptop, especially from a company like Acer. I have problems with apps being fuzzy (not scaling to the display properly), problems with Cortana and the Windows Start menu, and problems with the screen not immediately waking from sleep. These problems are rare and/or not too impactful, but still annoying.- The BIGGEST CON by far is the thermals. The laptop has amazing specs as I mentioned above, but it can't use them to their full potential because the components get too hot and have to cut back on speed. The fans are noisy and run at full speed often. I regularly experience temps of 70°+ while web browsing, and 90°+ while (light) gaming or other more intensive tasks.To me that is a huge letdown, as this laptop does not perform heavy tasks like it should. The processor is limited by the cooling of the laptop and can't really do all that it's has the potential to do.Overall, I am disappointed by the low upper limit of the hardware, but for my needs as a tech-savvy college student looking for a good laptop for classes, it's perfect. It's light and portable, sturdy, fast, and cheap. Even the gaming/heavy use cases are.... acceptable, even if they aren't what they could be. I recommend this laptop to many people, but it's not for everyone.

  I try really hard not to do same-day delivery reviews, no matter how great I think the product is because you can never tell on that first day what might go wrong later. However, I am actually confident and happy enough with this one to go for it. If I make amendments later, they won't likely be anything that changes this rating. (updated 6/19/20 - one week, using it for work in web design and content creation, still love it)I needed a business-appropriate laptop. My requirements for this were pretty simple: something with a sharp but conservative appearance, MOBILE (not heavy or bulky), but also just as powerful (or capable of being just as powerful) as my much larger personal laptop. It came down to this and the Lenovo Flex. I chose this because the design was all metal, and I liked Macbook Airs when working as an Apple systems manager for their durability, style, and mobility. It's just a shame the RAM is not upgradeable (it's soldered). The RAM on the Lenovo Flex is not upgradeable either, though. It also comes with a weaker processor (Ryzen 5, which isn't quite on the i7's level). I doubt anyone will need more than 8 to 16GB of RAM in the lifetimes of these laptops. I knew that if I got a Ryzen 5 that would just make me want the Ryzen 7 processor more (you can never upgrade processors in a laptop). So, despite toting less RAM, Swift still came out as the winner both in design and performance when I compared it up close to the Flex online.I worried a bit when I read a review that complained about the screen and graphics on Swift being almost unusable. But I clearly had nothing to worry about. Those professional reviewers sometimes can get so snobby with hardware, they set the bar higher than anyone in the real world would ever set it.The screen is semi-matte. I have very sensitive eyes, sensitive enough that I often have to wear blue light blocking glasses to deal with sunlight, bright indoor lights, or computer light. Even the slightest flicker is noticeable to me in a very uncomfortable, painful kind of way that strains my eyes. There's the tiniest amount of flicker in this display. It is NOTHING like the reviews have been describing, which made me afraid I wouldn't be able to use this laptop. It's VERY easy on my eyes after switching the AMD Radeon settings to Enhanced and High Res (which simultaneously smoothes and sharpens up the text, making it more legible). It also does NOT have a glossy, highly reflective screen. The screen is semi-matte at the worst (honestly, it's not even that much), and it's full matte once it's turned on. Evidently Acer has switched displays after the complaints (they tend to be good about doing things like that). It gets super bright, and the colors are close to true as far as I can tell - only publishing something is going to reveal the truth there, which I haven't done yet. But again, I can't believe what a close call it is to a Macbook Air.The graphics performance: It's not a gaming laptop, though I'm sure it is good enough to play most games on medium and would be PERFECT for a student. It's definitely strong enough to perform smoothly for graphic artists, photographers, and anyone that tends to keep a ton of tabs open in their browser. Smooth scrolling and rendering, no lag or glitching.I cannot compliment the Ryzen 7 processor enough. I am moving from an 8th gen i7 and the Ryzen 7 is WAY more responsive and less prone to freezing or errors. I can very easily believe it maxes out at 4ghz. Those eight cores handle multitasking like a true champ.I was worried the RAM would give me some issues with work because it's only 8gb and it's also underpowered to help boost battery performance. So far, I've been surprised to find that this low-powered RAM actually keeps up with me despite my issues with never exiting or closing windows, lol.The keyboard is extremely comfortable if you have small to medium-sized hands. There is some time to adjust to the smaller form factor. Large handed people will immediately hate the keyboard because it's compact. This being said, it IS a large keyboard as far as COMPACT keyboards go, and it is 100% identical to the keyboard on the Macbook Air. Same feel and everything. Backlit keys, which you can switch on or off. Something SUPER cool is that Acer figured out how to include a Numlock and number keypad on it by marking some of the letter keys with numbers, then adding a Numlock. (check my pictures)If you turn on the manual equalizer in the audio settings and crank it up, the speakers actually get really loud, and they're nice that way too (no rattle, no stress on the drivers). By default though, I can easily see tons of folks complaining about the speakers not getting loud. They don't get loud at all by default. With the equalizer maxed out, I would compare them to a mini Bluetooth speaker.In short, don't buy this for audio unless you're planning on connecting it to different speakers. For normal casual usage, like watching YouTube videos or streaming movies, the built-in speakers should be just fine.The lid is very well hinged. The screen is reinforced as well. Dropping it may cause some cosmetic damage, but it should hold up in most cases. At the worst, you'll be looking at a little cosmetic damage (scratches, dings) and a busted screen. Which is better than what you could face with the typical plastic body. I once dropped a plastic body laptop off the back of my car (I was an idiot and left it on the hood). It totally destroyed the body... the laptop still worked, but there was bare PCB board everywhere. It was ugly, lol.Now, there are complaints about battery life on this, but I haven't had any problems. I also didn't go with default settings in some key areas, though. I changed the Radeon settings to focus more on battery life than performance. Then I changed the power settings to best battery life. Now, I don't consider this to be much, especially with my huge collection of background apps, but considering complaints saying the battery wouldn't last more than an hour... hmmm. I'm not seeing it. I've been on battery for an hour now, and have 12h 46m remaining after charging to 98%. I'm guessing the expected battery life will hang somewhere between 4.5h and 6h on medium.Overall, it's a great machine and an awesome value in my book. I have no idea why the pro reviewers thought so poorly of it (though they did give it respect as a budget laptop). Maybe they were comparing it to more expensive laptops instead of comparing it to other models in this price range....? Or maybe the older version of this was really that bad.Whatever. I'm sticking with this because IT WORKS.Update: Two months later... it's still running like the day I got it. I'm actually shocked that it continues to perform so well on 8GB of energy saving RAM. I am guessing the difference lies in a combo of using a better processor and using a solid state drive. My other laptop has an A12, which is quad core and goes up to 3ghz - this Ryzen 7 is octacore and goes up to 4ghz.The Care Center app has a function in it to make the battery only change to 80% when it's plugged in (saves the battery cells from being burned out). So despite using it plugged in all the time, I have not lost any battery health. It still goes for six hours or more off battery.

  Just received the laptop today. It is amazing. The display is awesome. The laptop is very light (~2.6lb) and it is well constructed overall.  The keyboard is great with a few quirks e.g. a somewhat strong back-light. The performance is awesome, and it is relatively quiet.  I have seen laptops with poorer performance that are ~2X in cost. Kudos to AMD and Acer for bringing an excellent product at the right price point to market.

  First and foremost, this thing is tiny, I'm pretty sure most phones are bigger than this. The keyboard is completely unusable, irredeemably awful would be too kind. The battery life is unimpressive, and the processing ""power"" that so many ostensibly professional reviewers were blown away by has been noticeably absent. Often opening a simple menu will cause the cursor icon to visibly stutter. And the heat that this thing produces, even on stand-by, leads me to believe it will be a very short lived piece of hardware.Worst of all, and most inexcusable, using anything other than the bloated installation of Windows 10 it comes with is made essentially impossible by the complete and total lack of driver support. Simple things like the touchpad won't work, and Acer couldn't be bothered to make those drivers available. I didn't buy this out the back of a van in a Safeway parking lot, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a modicum of basic support. Maybe if they spent a little less money on photoshoots of supermodels looking inquisitively into the distance they could afford to host a few hundred megabytes worth of files. Acer is pathetic.

   I was angry of seeing this kind of fake like screen. Description says it is 178view angle. 178 is ips screen. This one has 20degree view angle i saw in 1997. Maybe it is a fake laptop or screen replaced. This screen extinct in 21st century. You cannot figure out what color is it that that you are seeing on the screen. NOT AT ALL. Screen brightness change even if you move slightly. No matter what distance between 5” ~3ft. It is that bad.  NO matter how you see, top and bottom of the screen have different color and brightness.

  Really like this purchase. Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.

  The worst brand new laptop computer I have ever purchased. Screen quality is so so. Can’t run simple games without lagging out.. audio isn’t even relevant. Can’t hear it at all on 100% volume.

  Ok. Lets talk. No fluff, no fake optimism. Out of all the things I have ever bought on amazon, this purchase was honestly the best. First of all, this laptop exceeded all expectations I had. Like for example, when I saw the laptop for the first time, the screen was sooo much bigger than I anticipated! I love the feeling of the keys. Also, I'm sure you've notice there are a lot of reviews complaining about the screen quality. Ok. Here's the tea sis; the screen is awesome. I'm not seeing anything wrong with it. Those people must be computer experts but for me, there is nothing wrong with it. Also, a big criteria for me was that I could do some gaming. Dude. Literally this laptop is awesome for gaming. It has taken everything that I've downloaded so far and is still purring like a kitten. Overall, this is a super good laptop. I totally think you should get it.

  Let's start with the hardware itself. I was worried the screen would be as terrible as some of these reviews indicate. In my opinion, the screen is just fine. It's probably not great in very bright sunlight, or for video or photo editing purposes. Otherwise, if you just want to do indoor office work, or browse the web, it's totally sufficient and not a reason to pass up this laptop. If you are already used to higher quality displays or have demanding display needs, stop being cheap and look to spend a bit more money.I like the feel and look of the keyboard but I don't like the layout so much. It's novel to include the keypad on a laptop of this size, but it's too close to the other keys. The result is that sometimes you hit the number pad instead of enter, or backspace. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker, and if you type a lot like I do, you'll probably find that you can develop a type of muscle/spacial-familiarity to where it becomes an infrequent issue very quickly.I bought this laptop to install linux on. It required a bit of wrangling with the BIOS to make that possible. Firstly, secure boot and some other settings need to be disabled in the BIOS. Next problem was, this machine does not seem to be capable of booting from the microSD card slot at all. I was able to boot off a USB-connected drive. Once I set the built-in storage interface mode to AHCI in the BIOS, I was able to complete my installation and everything works great. For the record I installed the ""elementaryOS"" distro.

  I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop. It is plenty fast for office apps and the internet with the battery lasting all day. Thumbs up.

  For the price, this is a great Chromebook. It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research.1. Solid build. Nice sturdy plastic chassis. (Keeps it lightweight)2. USB type C port, SD card slot, HDMI, and USB 3.03. Touchscreen with an IPS display4. 4 gigs of RAM and 64gig of storage. (rare at this price point)5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad.6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.

  Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.

  Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can’t be downloaded on this chrome book. Internet and everything else works fine, but I bought this for my kids to play Roblox and other apps, but this particular chrome book won’t allow the Google Play store.I had no idea that it was even possible for the Google App Store not to be compatible with a Google Chrome Book!

  Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed.

  Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users.

  I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot.

  Pros:• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

  Purchased this item trying to make sure I got the right item and non-defective so I went with the one sold by Amazon.com. I opened it and started filling out all my information, applying a screen protector and all of this for nothing but madness. I wasted many hours out of my day just to end up returning this item. This was actually labeled with a label printer as Surface Pro 7 on the box but I wanted to make sure I got the right product which I didn't! I actually got a Surface Pro 6. I did not know if this was an intentional scam for all customers or I just had a fluke. Anyways here are the pictures and now I'll be exchanging the item for this same exact one... I mean an actual Surface Pro 7. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR MODEL ONCE YOU RECEIVE THIS ITEM!

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.

  This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price

  I've been using a chromebook as my primary computer for well over 5 years.  The last one I used was an Acer c720 with an i3 processor, I loved that thing.... I replaced the battery and it still works great but this deal was too good to pass up. $450 for a 7th generation m3 processor convertible chromebook with a dedicated stylus is a great deal.  Considering google is offering free note taking apps on the offers page also sweetens the deal.  In my opinion, this computer is a significantly better value than anything you'd get from a windows computer in this price range.I initially ordered this when it was priced $495 and a 3rd party retailer sent me an xe521qab (dark grey) instead of the listed xe520qab (light grey).  I'm going to compare both units at the end.I'm starting with reviewing the specs and hardware since I think mentioning overall build quality is important and why I chose this unit over others. I'm also going to compare both models since everyone needs to know what they're buying before they actually buy it. I'm also going to touch briefly on the capabilities of Chrome OS and its limitations so first time buyers have an idea what they're getting.Pros:- Convertible, able to run Android apps- Included stylus built into the computer- Fast, low power CPU (fanless computer)- Full HD screen (1920 x 1200 resolution)- Great battery life- Audio is great, just quiet- Linux apps available from within ChromeOS- Keyboard has good travel, very comfortable to type- Trackpad is a good size and is responsiveCons:- No backlit keyboard (some chromebooks in this price range have them)- Can't install any kind of Windows or Mac programs- Will not be able to play computer games, but it can play mobile games from androidProcessor:The processor in this unit is an intel core m3-7y30. To me, this is one of the best processors you can ask for in a Chromebook, but can be underpowered in a Windows laptop. The two specs I feel are most important are 4.5 W TDP and 1.0 ghz - 2.6 ghz clock speed.In layman's terms, this processor has extremely low power requirements which sips power and is able to increase its clock speed high enough to get tasks done. This chip can also hyperthread, basically making it more efficient per core and increasing speed as well.  Because of this low power state, the processor doesn't heat up too much and the computer doesn't need a fan.  The computer makes no noise.  I've noticed zero lag at all, even using the stylus.  This thing is overpowered for most tasks Chrome OS needs. It's a great balance between power needed vs maximizing battery life.To give you an idea on price, this processor's MSRP is $280.  Kind of already covers half of the price of the computer already.Screen:Incredible considering the wide viewing angles, I can see the screen from every angle possible. My old Acer c720 has the worst screen imaginable with a very narrow, low resolution display.  This thing is just as nice as a ""retina"" display in any macbook.Battery:As stated earlier, the M3 processor doesn't use much power compared to other processors, the lack of a fan also saves a lot of power.running a crosh battery test, the rate of decline without running anything is about 1% in 300 seconds, or about 12% an hour.  So I would say best case scenario, 8 - 8.3 hours of battery life.  This is good, not the best, but certainly good enough for me.  I got 3 days of solid use before I needed a new charge.  In comparison, my acer c720 sipped about 1.25% every 300 seconds, or had around 6.7 hours of battery life.  It is older and the CPU's are different, but overall it's significantly better.Audio:Great for a laptop.  Audio has good dynamic range, just no bass.  These are solid speakers and it feels premium, just not nearly as premium as a macbook for instance.Chrome OS:When you buy a Chromebook, you should primarily be using it for web browsing and simple tasks.  If you're tied into google's ecosystem it can do much more. On the other hand, if you're tied into Apple's ecosystem it can be a challenge to use.Chrome OS can't run computer programs built for Windows or Mac, such as microsoft office and photoshop. You can use an online suite of office or the android apps, but they aren’t the same. Setting up a wired printer can be confusing.  Downloading word documents may change the way they look when opened with google docs. Conversely, saving things from google docs to word format may also mess up the formatting, issues I wish would get polished out in the future.Overall, I think chromebooks are absolutely ready for widespread use.  Chrome OS is much more secure than both Windows and Mac's, the fact that you hardly ever download anything keeps the computer fast and secure.  The lightweight OS absolutely flies, for everyday tasks it's much faster than Windows or OS X and you'll notice a difference right away.Linux Programs:Back in the day (6 years ago), you had to sideload a linux OS in order to use linux apps. It worked but was clunky and made it much harder to keep linux up to date.  Plus it took up valuable space on the chromebook and you had to switch OS' completely in order to use them.Today, ChromeOS has a linux virtual machine built into it, and you're able to pull apps from the linux database directly into ChromeOS and run apps.  This is absolutely amazing to me, and I'm not sure when google decided to do this, but it basically makes ChromeOS a near complete machine with much lower limitations.  This gives you access to good program alternatives to photoshop and microsoft office, especially if you need something that does a little bit more than what google apps can do.  This is by no means as nice or complete as Windows or Mac as it still requires knowledge to do it properly and keep it up to date, but it's free and open source, and I think it's important to support that idea.  Linux and Android are the two most popular open source platforms, there's a lot of things you can do with both of them and it's great having both available within Chrome OS.Tablet:This is where ChromeOS is heading towards, so I wouldn't recommend getting a chromebook that isn't convertible at this point.  It's nice to have and makes it able to run android apps.Apps that would be useful on a chromebook would be anything that can take notes and take advantage of a stylus.  It's good for annotating powerpoints, drawing, or taking school notes if you enjoy writing over typing.  Everything else is just gimmicky, but It's still amazing to have an ability to flip the thing around and have a high resolution tablet available.xe520qab vs xe521qab:When I purchased this chromebook, a manufacturer sent me the 521 by mistake, so to get the lower price I had to return it and get the 520.  Amazon unfortunately wasn't able to price match.  I took pictures so everyone can see the difference.The 521 is simply nicer.  It has a darker body, metal keyboard deck, smooth edges; it just feels much better and more expensive. It's rounder in most places, tablet mode feels smoother and better when holding it.  The only two thing I like about the 520 is how it looks when it's closed and it feels better when opening it. The sharp edges are nice and clean, but the plastic keyboard deck just isn’t as comfortable.If you can find the xe521qab for the same price as the xe520qab, I'd pick the 521 in a heartbeat.  Other than that you're getting the exact same thing.  Both are fantastic computers and I'm sure anybody would be happier with either pick.$450 is an absolute steal for either of these computers.

  This is really a high quality machine. The price I paid almost reflected that quality, but I snagged it when an incredible deal was running. The m3 processor is more than enough power to do regular tasks that anyone does online plus all the productivity work that is needed in a workplace. My wife is a teacher and this was purchased for her, so most of this feedback is from what she's said as she's used it.First, let's talk about the display. It really is a beautiful display with accurate-enough colors. It gets a little over-saturated in some situations and under-saturated in others, creating some awkward hue on backgrounds of darker movies or webpages. But those are only noticeable while objects are moving (or when you're scrolling) and there's a lot of action on the screen. It gets bright enough for most situations and in the previous Pro model I wondered why it got as bright as it did. Watching reviews it seemed like you almost don't need to use a lamp to lighten a room, just turn the display face up and turn it up; that should be plenty to light an entire bedroom.Second is the quality of the material. The device feels like a brushed aluminum or other metal material with some plastic in some places. This is about right for the price, considering an even better quality of material would get you easily spending $900+. The keyboard feels fantastic and the touchscreen hasn't had a single hiccup yet after about 2 months of use.Third, let's talk about functionality. And, before we begin, let's remember this is a Chromebook. This wasn't purchased to play the latest games or sync with Microsoft or Apple services. It's a Samsung product running a Google operating system, meaning that it's meant to work with Google services. That said, it works wonderfully for Google Drive (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). This item is used almost exclusively to do lesson planning, grading, research, and other tasks that a teacher would do. For that, it's perfect. The only real issues we've had entail poor web design and a lack of websites switching to HTML5 instead of Flash.All in all, if you're wanting the performance of a Google Pixelbook and similar functionality then you won't be disappointed. If you want to get a loved one a computer that will really allow them to use the Internet without too much worry about viruses, then you're making a good purchase. If you're intending to get a laptop that can run Android apps without too much of a ""herky jerky"" experience, then you're making a good purchase. If you're wanting a computer that can run Photoshop, render 4K videos, or anything like that, then you're better off with other products.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 13"" Laptop, FHD (1920 x 1080) Touch Display, Intel Core i3-10110U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 64GB eMMC, Intel Integrated Graphics, Chrome OS, 82B80006UX, Graphite Grey",$397.12,5.0,"
  Best bang-for-your-buck Chromebook, with the beauty of a high-end yet overly priced Samsung, Asus, or Pixelbook. This little book is perfect in almost every way.In general, this Chromebook is perfect for what I bought it for: work-related tasks on the web, surfing the web, using Google Docs to type up documents & write lyrics for songs, and organizing thoughts and ideas into productivity apps and jotting down tasks in my Microsoft To-Do list app.  This Chromebook is lightning fast in powering up, connecting to WiFi & Bluetooth, and opening apps & browsers.The Screen size is non-jeopardizing; large enough for a functional workspace, but small enough to easily store away in a backpack. Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you're trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It's quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It's back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you're used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don't have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn't been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn't completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.

  Revised - 3/9/21As others have complained, the right hinge for the monitor is defective. I can't open/close the laptop unless I do it very slow using two hands so the monitor would not break. From what all are saying I guess I am SOL. I will contact Lenovo none the less to see if the will fix this.Revised - 9/30/20I must apologize to Lenovo. The issues I was facing was from my own doing. I forgot that I had set the OS to dev mode sometime ago and that was causing the device to act up. After setting the OS back to standard mode, it is running smoothly not freezing once.  All our headache went away.  Back to 5 stars!Revised - 9/24/20Stay AWAY!! Now the sound is going away during my daughter's virtual class.  We need to restart the device in order to get the sound back.  I would stay away from this device if you need something for school.  Our first Chromebook so not sure if this is normal for Chromebook.  Very dissapointed to say the least.Revised - 9/23/20Our device is starting to freeze daily and needing restart.  This is extremely frustrating for my 4th grade daughter when learning virtually.  It is not like she has too many files or apps open so I'm down grading this to three stars.With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14"" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3"" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We'll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I'm still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it's not that difficult.  It's no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of us：）

  After six months of use the right hinge broke and started flexing the screen out.Looks like a bad design. Lenovo repair has you fill out a repair ticket but no info as where to send it, RMA or any other info.I have laptops that are over four years old and dont have any problems with hinges.*UPDATE* Lenovo fixed the hinge but broke the covers in the processes. Looks like they used a crowbar to pry them off. Took three months to get the unit back.  I would look at the Acer Spin over this.

  I've used quite a few Chromebooks before (Samsung, Pixelbook, Acer, HP). This time I wanted something that had a 14"" Full HD screen and an Intel Core i3+ processor (main for my children to use), but also wanted something that was snappy.For $400, this Chromebook has been impressive and has a solid build and is fairly lightweight.- Keyboard is great with keys nicely placed.- The HD touchscreen is sharp- The unit performs well with a moderate amount of tabs open, streaming two Youtube videos is no problem.- The flip screen is a nice touch- There's a good # of ports as well (dual USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, mini-SD card slot)- The webcam is great for video conferencing (even comes with a neat built-in webcam cover ).- Installing apps from the Google Play store was simple enough.It is a great Chromebook this price point!

  What can I say it’s just as good as I thought it would be. It’s well made and very fast! My other laptop that runs windows 10 has a i7, 8GB of ram, and a SSD. This feels just as fast (or faster) for half the price and better portability.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"" Laptop, 15.6"" HD (1366 x 768) Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 128GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics, Windows 10, 81W10094US, Business Black",$359.99,3.0,"
  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it!

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

  Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn’t work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn’t that bad.

  Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back.

  Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again.

  Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!

  I love my new MacBook Air, it came as expected (relatively like new condition). This my first Mac and I’d purchase it again refurbished, you save greatly and get almost the same product 😀

  Bought certified refurbished ended up with a unit with a screen covered in dead pixels. I contacted apple to see how much a screen replacement should be more I'm looking a repair cost more than I paid for the laptop.

  I bought this MacBook as I needed a well built (long lasting), fast, compact laptop that can handle day to day tasks in addition to creative work down the road (I am trying to get into Photography and Video Editing). This laptop checked everything off my list.In addition, I wanted a laptop that can seamlessly sync with my phone (iPhone 11 Pro). I love that I can answer calls, respond to texts, and read emails between all of my devices automatically without having to really set anything up or picking up my phone. The screen is also one of the best to look at in my opinion.I briefly had the 2019 entry level model of the MacBook Pro 13 with 2 ports but I quickly returned it as the 2 ports where quite limiting, I wasn't satisfied with the performance, and the butterfly keyboard was not my favorite and gave me anxiety. I am glad I waited a bit longer for this refresh before going for the higher end model as I am actually saving money as I did not have to purchase upgrades to get the 16 gigs of ram I wanted and I also get twice the storage as well which means I don't have to buy an external SSD, until I am much closer to starting creative work.So far I am very impressed with the MacBook Pro and it is so far my favorite laptop to date solely because it works so well with other gadgets I have. The only thing I could nitpick is it still feels expensive for the specs but you get what you pay for, this is a sturdy/premium feeling laptop and blows away any of the laptops I have purchased in the past that feel cheap. If I run into any issues I will update my review but I can't wait to dive in further.

  This is my first mac computer and coming from windows based computers this thing is amazing. I don't think ill ever go back to a windows pc. As with all apple products the quality and feel is the best. As for the computer itself it arrived in perfect condition and a day early. The new 2020 13"" works flawless absolutely zero issues with setup and initial operation as is expected with the apple premium paid. If you're debating on switching to macbook pro or upgrading your older macbook I don't think you'll be disappointed.

  Compared to laptop PCs I've owned, the battery life on this is terrible. I have to charge it a couple times throughout the day (I'm not even a ""power user""). Other than that, it seems to work okay. It's NOT as fast as I thought it would be, coming from using a 3-year old Dell XPS 13. I thought this would be so much faster than that, but it's only a minor noticeable difference. Not sure it's worth the price, since a PC with similar (or better) specs can be had for less money. There have also been issues with the ambient light switching between blue to ambient-- that's annoying (a quick online search will show that others have had this issue too). Also, when I try to update some apps it says, """"...cannot be updated because it was refunded or purchased with a different Apple ID"" -- maybe this was a returned machine? If so, that's not good either. IDK.

  This is first time I am posting review and I am very frustrated with amazon. Actually I am prime member since 2016 and I but almost every week from amazon. This is the first time i am very disappointed. Package arrived 1 week delay than guaranteed delivered date by UPS. I ordered new macbook with 16 gb ram and 1tb ssd but received 8gb ram and 256 ssd probably old released macbook. I opened laptop about 40 minutes and setup all necessary steps and it just blinked few times and shutdown automatically and didn't turn on back, I put laptop in charge but it didn't response anything.  I called to amazon technical support and one gentleman tried to help me out but didn't work and he connected call to apple store with export and finally that man asked me serial number and after checking serial number, he said it's not 2020 16gb ram, 1tb ssd laptop, than I checked laptop box and it said 8gb ram, 256 gb ssd.Because of covid 19, my all classes is in online so I tried to work whatever I got but it even didn't turn on. It's so frustrating. Finally I decided to return it and get windows from best buy.

  This review has to do with Amazon’s customer service during my entire experience with returning this laptop. Safe yourself the trouble purchase directly through apple and save your self the money and headache . I returned the laptop since it did this weird glitching twice and for a brand new laptop I did not feel that was a good sign so I returned it ....... then the nightmare started. After two week I called because I did not receive any correspondence. I called and found out the laptop was received a week earlier . The agent said they were testing the item , which I understand it’s a more expensive item and they have their procedures. I called back a week later and the agent was like oh that’s weird I don’t know why they didn’t release the funds so he went ahead and did it and then explained that because it was a “large amount” it would have to be in three releases.... $1700 for Amazon is pocket change . But I was like whatever as long as I get my money back . Now here i am a month later on the phone as I type this STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK!!! BUY YOUR APPLE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM APPLE YOUVE BEEN WARNED !

  As a long time Mac User, my old macbook is still holding up pretty well! I was expecting to upgrade to the rumored 14 inch Macbook Pro, but it did come.After window shopping a lot of PC Laptops, especially Dell XPS, I am still convinced making right choice buying this once I open the package. Apple still delivers the best quality product!PC vs. Mac?PC may seems offering better value, they are NOT stable, after 2 years usage, it would comes with millions of glitches.Mac = STABLE, No Hassle, functioning good for years!

  Heck, dollar for dollar this is the GAMING rig to beat.Item of Note:There IS a 2.5” hard drive caddy/cable with this model. Also the 2nd M.2 slot does show up if you put a NVME in there (not sure about SATA m.2 as I didn’t have one to test). It is standard 80mm size, same as the main slot, and seems to have extra room above/below it so I believe something double sided would fit, as would something with a SMALL heatsink on top (like say the Adata Swordfish one).Screen:Most of the other gaming laptops in the $750-1100 range have dim ~250 nit screens with awful <50% color gamuts. This one, 300nit rated (~330 actual based on reviews) 144hz and 100% srgb. It is striking, you won’t find a screen like this in this price range elsewhere.Power:Then you have a 8c/16t 4800H processor, which netted just under 4700 on Cinebench R20 in Performance Mode. For reference, my desktop running a Ryzen 3700X 8c/16t scores between 4600 and 4800 depending on background software and performance settings.Memory:The ram is ideal, 3200mhz, 16gb, you don’t want any less because that’s the lower limit for gaming and productivity, and you don’t want any more because each 8gb is about 3watts of power consumption. Not sure if it supports 32gb, I can’t see 16gb being the limit but the Lenovo Support responders in Q&A here seem to think it is.Battery.:It would be nice if they had any prebuilt options with the 80wh version, but they don’t, and I took a star off for that. Most of us would gladly pay an extra $50+ for that option. And I don’t feel like waiting 5+ weeks (2 months? 3?) for a custom one just to get it. That being said, with proper settings this 60wh can be sufficient.*Quiet Mode (fn+q until power led turns blue)*Battery Save mode on (click on battery icon, slide all the way to left)*Hybrid Mode on (this is ESSENTIAL, it shuts off the dedicated graphics card when not needed)*In Advanced Power Settings, adjust all of the AMD, Wireless, etc settings to their most ‘battery saving’ optionDoing all that I’m getting over 5 hours browsing the internet, longer if I have the internet open and am mostly working in excel or word (ie: normal school work/reports for office/etc). For instance, editting this review in the Amazon window, 4.1 hours remaining w/ 55% (7.5 hours total est). 7-8 hours watching Youtube @720p in Edge. Brightness at whatever battery saver drops it to when it’s on high to begin with. I intend on trying to swap in an 80wh when the parts are available.Build quality:The fit/finish and overall feel of the unit hits above its price point. The keyboard is exceptional for productivity, aside from the slightly cramped numpad. The touchpad is responsive. The rear I/O ports are great for desktop duty. But lets be real, Lenovo doesn’t exactly have a great reputation when it comes to customer service and turnaround times for repairs. None of the laptop manufacturers do though really, save Apple. My last Lenovo, a Y700, lasted over 5 years. I figure, get it, do some stress testing on the processor/GPU (Cinebench, Furmark), watch some movies and do some white/black backgrounds to check for dead pixels, and cross your fingers. To extend warranty through them is $50/100/175 for 1/2/3 extra years respectively, I personally am planning at least the $50 for an extra year.Heat:There is one drawback, this thing gets hot. I was expecting better thermals as I tested out a Legion 5 with the 4600H + 1650ti combo a while back. I would say this one runs ~5c average hotter across the board, and will spike to 95-100C+ if you’re doing something intense like Cinebench or Flight Sim 2020. In Flight Sim, average CPU temps over a 20 min flight were ~76c, CPU Die avg was ~85C. Temps are lower playing less demanding games, and even normally demanding games like AC Origins CPU avg was low 70’s, so not terrible. I spent some time looking into this, and apparently these hopped up gaming laptops hitting 90-100C is ‘okay’, even if I don’t really like or trust it. Also, the only option I know of that actually runs cooler than this with similar hardware is the Omen 15 AMD, so if temps are a priority may want to check that platform out. The Asus Tuf’s are as hot if not hotter, and the Dell G5 SE is a small portable sun. However, you do get something for this heat, the aforementioned Cinebench scores blow the competition out of the water, I still can’t believe it’s on par with my desktop processor.Final Thoughts:This thing runs warm, looks good (if you like the aesthetic), has a phenomenal spec sheet for the price, and has best in class screen for a non special-order low-mid budget prebuilt. Would recommend, with the one slight caveat regarding heat.

  This laptop is good, performance, design, screen and fast.However, something is wrong.First of all, I always check hard disk whenever I buy a laptop since I sometimes experienced receiving used laptop instead of new. It happened to this laptop. I check hard disk and it was turned on 208 times before.It might be program error but as far as I know, they are pretty accurate(crystal disk info) It looks new but might be not. Maybe I am unlucky. I will post another review later after I investigate more.update 1.So, My purchase date and warranty start date are different.Usually, warranty starts when I first install Windows and turn on laptop first time.This laptop had started warranty about more than 1 month ago, it doesn't any make sense to me.I talked about it with Amazon customer service and what they said is 'just return it',So disappointing so far.

  Edit 2: have been using the laptop for few month. No issues at all. Love it. Will move it back to 4 stars..........Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review. After 10 days, this vertical line appeared and it's constant through all applications, even in Bios. Meaning this is a hardware defect. Will change my review to one star for poor quality control. I have returned the laptop and Amazon honored 30 day return window. The new units doesn't have this line. Will see if the same problems happens in the next few weeks.............................If you're not willing wait to RTX 3000. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. The build quality is good. Fan is quite and powerful. Love it.I've been using the laptop now for a week. It's much better than what I thought. Super quite when you need it be quite. Powerful when you need it to be powerful. I actually returned the Helios 300, which I bough for 999 as well on a deal. Helios 300 has RTX 2060 which is not so different from 1660 Ti (Don't let them fool you). .With helios noise at idle is just unbearable, Intel heat is ridiculous as well and the build quality doesn't come close Legion 5.  Legion 5 Beats it at all the way. .

  I really like the new design. It looks like a workstation more than a gaming laptop!I'm gonna try and keep this short:PROS:- build quality is excellent,- specs are insane,- 2.5kg and the dimensions make it really portable,- screen is amazing! 144Hz and 300nits.- Ryzen 7 4800H...- GTX 1660ti is great for video editing and gaming!- laptop feels premium!CONS:- speakers are mediocre. Volume is decent but the sound quality is ok.-battery is really bad...less that 4 hours.- there is no international warranty (now this is Lenovo fault)!To be honest, this laptop is best buy at this price (999$). I'm really glad I bought it!Edit:There is a lot of problems with Linux...I actually thought Lenovo was the best with open source drivers and support for Linux...I was wrong.I can't run Linux, I can't have warranty in my own country, I can't have normal battery life. I guess I'll return it!Edit 2:I have random freezes. It just stops responding while doing random stuff. Returning it!

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 4GB RAM 32GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K01US",$186.05,2.0,"
  About Me/ExpectationsI purchased this chromebook after having a wonderful experience with the Samsung Chromebook 3. I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram—I had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can’t do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn’t had a chromebook or hasn’t updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn’t wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it’s far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine—this one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn’t because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn’t because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn’t break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don’t hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like—I did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn’t been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn’t worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don’t select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product.

  I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.

  This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life. The display is not as good as those laptops costing 2 to 4 times as much but it is fine for daily use and I don't find it be a problem even when using it for long periods of time.

  This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!

  Listen, this is a sub $300 Chromebook— they had to cut costs somewhere. Is the TN panel great? No. But this laptop cost me $302 with tax, has 6gb of RAM and 64gb of storage, will be updated at least until 2026,  also does what I need it to do (homework/writing). I have the Samsung Chrome book 3 too, and the 4 is a nice upgrade. This is a light laptop with a small footprint. so I can easily carry it back and forth to campus. Also, the new design is freaking sexy. Probably my favorite laptop of all time.

  I ordered this for my wife. It is perfect for her to surf the Internet and check email quickly. As others have said, the screen could be better. The screen is not good when viewed at from an angle. But then, it's an inexpensive item. It's the first Chromebook I've ever purchased. The speed is great. It boots almost instantly. It has great battery life. It is very light. The keyboard is responsive. It has to USB 3.0 ports and bluetooth. I connected an inexpensive bluetooth mouse to the system without a problem. My wife could not be happier.

  I bought 2 of these computers for my kids for virtual learning.  One works great, the other started having problems just 1-2 weeks after school started.  I tried to return/exchange at that time and I was connected with HP support.  HP support assured me this was a one time issue and not to return, but to troubleshoot.  I troubleshooted for about 2 hours and the problem appeared to be fixed.  But now, 3 weeks later (and now out of the ""return period""), and the same issue happening, plus it will not start up at all.  Now I cannot return and HP is requesting $$ for me to ship to them so they can fix it.  Extremely disappointed.

  I have had a few laptops in the last couple years and I must say, this purchase I am most fond of. I like how light weight and compact it is and still do what I need done for my business as for memory. I am a mobile company and the durability is outstanding. I have always been a fan of HP and was skeptical about going with a miniature laptop for travel purposes and I am happy I made the choice with HP.

  Great little computer, I have only had it for 4 days, but so far so good. I purchased this for my son who will be doing remote learning when school starts back up next month. The set up was easy, the computer talks you through the whole process if you allow it to by selecting the voice prompt. My son loves it, especially the blue metallic color, its small but for an elementary school student, its perfect. Now the only question is will it last, I did get the warranty, just in case.

  Purchased as a gift for a student. She is so pleased! Highly recommended! Not for gaming and that sort, but working well for academic purposes!

  This laptop wasn't what I expected but it's functional. It has very little storage space so an external drive is a must unless you rely on storing in a cloud. Did not have room to install alot of the applications I use daily, like the Microsoft Office suite or Gmail. The windows system on it was very hard to manage making it impossible to install what you need without going through Microsoft Office store and getting a knock-off version of the app you really want so it was a bit of a nuisance.  Did not have the ports that I need for an Ethernet hookup. Even though it has wireless capability, I like the option to connect when the WiFi is not strong. I would recommend this for small children as a starter laptop.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Windows Tablet 10in, Ultra Slim Windows 10 Tablet PC - 4GB RAM 64GB Storage, 5MP and 2MP Cameras, 1280x800 IPS HD Display, Black",$240.59,2.0,"
  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  Yo he tenido laptops HP que me han durado pero lamentablemente en esta ocasión no tuve la misma suerte con este modelo y proveedor ya que desde el primer día tuvo problemas con la actualización e inicio para ingresar al sistema. Toda esta semana he estado llamando a soporte de HP y no se ha logrado resetear el sistema por lo que decidí iniciar el proceso de reembolso y devolución. Ha sido mucho desgaste mental en lidiar con una laptop que se supone que al ser nueva debe trabajar óptimamente. Solo espero que la resolución de reembolso y devolución termine bien con Amazon ya que el envío de devolucion desde Costa Rica costo mucho dinero por lo que ojalá este comentario llegue al proveedor que por supuesto no lo recomiendo. Ya lo pensaré bien en adquirir otra laptop desde este medio ya que se complica la devolución. Así que les recomiendo que compren con calma.

  I have had good luck with HP computers and this is not an exception. All hardware features seem good, though Bluetooth is sometimes flaky. Though not specifically an HP issue, on the down side MS Windows is too insistent that you use their browser, login to an MS account (why?), and download only their apps. Funny, I thought I paid for Windows when I bought the computer but I guess MS believes they have the right to nag the user forever.

  This is a good decent laptop for school kids or college students. Not for business use. The specs on the sellers site are deceiving. The screen quality is not what it says. It's just a typical LCD screen that has a little more brightness than it's older predecessor. It does not have backlit keys and the keyboard lettering can't hardly be seen.The laptop feels cheap and fragile. I get worried when carrying it. Hard drive is not upgradeable. The battery life does not last as long as stated in the Sellers site. We ran tests using several programs and browsing the internet. Overall, it is not designed for creative design. As stated it is good for home use, school kids and college students. Not good for traveling even though it is a little light and it is overpriced. We donated ours to a school.

  I've had this product for about a month and really have no complaints.  Boots up quick with no delay.  My only issue is with the on/off switch.  It's too small.  Also, I miss not having an indicator light showing when ""caps lock"" is on.  Other than these two issues I really like the unit!

  Great laptop. Even tho its a 3070 you still gotta mess w nvidias 3D settings and with the games internal vsync settings to really optimize each game. 360 hz is awsome but don't play demanding games at high settings with 360 hz cause the screen completely glitches out. Took me a week of internal pain to figure that out. They run smooth at 60hz w vsync (depending on game) though. For games that don't have a refresh rate option in their settings (weird but games such as Sniper Elite 4 don't have it) go to the razer synapses and change it in the performance tab to 60. Then when ur done playing go back and change it to 360 if you want. Kinda a hassle but that's what you get with a machine like this. You just can't win lol. Overall awsome powerhouse that's so slim and fits right in your backpack without taking much space. But omg the power supply is so thiccc. Battery life is awsome, given that it's an insanely powerful gaming laptop. Lasts almost 3 hours when using google nonstop. Look if you want battery life get a Mac. But for gaming this thing rocks. Just have some patience and once you set up everything you'll begin planning your wedding to this thing. Peace.

  The computer is really nice. I'm not an expert on gaming computers or anything like that. It is my first gaming laptop. When playing games, the computer does get decently hot. The fans start running harder almost instantly when running a game but the way it looks and feels, is totally great.

  I was actually surprised at how well this computer performs while multitasking. I use this laptop with an external monitor as well as a Bluetooth mechanical keyboard. Right now it’s my daily driver for a workstation until my new desktop comes in and it’s getting the job done. It is capable of getting 144fps in Fortnite I haven’t tried any other games on it though.

  First things first, I am writing this review on this laptop right now, and it's absolutely amazing for typing, the touchpad is nice and responsive, and the screen is vibrant and bright. My only gripes are with two things. One:  The battery management system, tries its best to switch between the Nvidia gpu and the integrated one, but ultimately doesn't pick the one I would have wanted 30% of the time, and I need to go into the Nvidia contol panel to change it, then restart the laptop. Also, due to the fact that drainning a lithium battery too quickly damages it, the laptop reduces the maximum performance when not plugged in. I can reasonably get 5 or 6 hours of use out of it when I'm not doing more than browsing or watching a video, but if you plan on gaming while on bettery you're looking at no more than an hour and a half.Two: The surface finish is impossible to keep clean. it looks great if you wipe it down with a microfiber cloth, but as soon as you touch it, there's fingerprints everywhere, and it looks like I just mashed a greasey cheeseburger all over it. I might get a vinyl skin for the lid and the palm rest, but i'll wait and see how bad it really is. This next part is not Razer's fault, but just a problem I had with Corsair's Icue peripheral service. I installed Icue to integrate with mouse and my headphones, and I noticed that I was getting only 2 hours of bettery life, which confused me. It turns out the driver was hitting the cpu with just enough requests that it was running at its full frequency all the time. I had to just uninstall it to get my 6 hours of battery life back. Other than that, this laptop manages to pack an insane amount of power and performance into a surprisingly thin but dense package, and I love that about it. It feels solid and has almost no plastic and no cheap feeling parts. When it's plugged in I can barely tell the difference bewteen it and my desktop at home which really shows just how far technology has improved in just a year. Funnily enough, the silicon shortage has hit other manufactureres so bad, that their cheaper plastic laptops with the same parts are actually more expensive that this much nicer product. I plan on keeping this for a long time, and I can definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a product that they plan on using for workstation or gaming purposes.

  I purchased this because my son needed my laptop. At first, I thought it was great. All I really did was search the web and visit sites. It's fast and nice for that. Once I downloaded my Silhouette Studio program, I have trouble now doing anything due to low disc space. This is pretty upsetting since this is the only program I have downloaded. I don't stream Netflix or anything like that. I didn't realize how bad it was until months later now that I need to work on projects with this software. I don't recommend using this for a cricut or silhouette.

  I purchased this computer purposely for school and web surfing. The computer has nice looking features and it hasn’t given me any problems. However, I would not recommend it for anything other than web surfing, reading articles, doing research and typing up documents. This computer has very little storage room. I am unable to save all of my school related documents due to this issue. Other than that, it’s great. Also, you’ll have to get a mouse. Using the finger touch mouse on the lap top can get annoying.

  I bought this laptop for my daughter to use for school.  She is ten.  We received it and almost immediately, it stopped charging.  I thought, no big deal, it's probably a defective charger.  I bought a new charger.  Same thing.  So I contacted HP Support.  They fixed the computer and sent it back to me.  However, they reinstalled Windows 10, which deleted my one year free trial of Microsoft Office.  I contacted them about this and they said that I would just have to download the one month free trial or purchase it for $69.99.  I specifically purchased this laptop for the one year free trial and HP refuses to fix the problem that is THEIR fault.  If it hadn't been for a faulty laptop in the first place, it wouldn't have needed to have Windows reinstalled.  I will never again purchase an HP product.  Buyer, beware!

  Honestly if you wanna computer for school with the basic needs this computer is for you. I don’t get how people complain about the storage but honestly you can buy the SD card and put it in your computer and you can have more storage at the beginning I was debating Whether to buy it but I ended up buying it and it works amazing and it looks fabulous on my desk. love the color couldn’t ask for more . The way they pack the computer to ship it to you is well done.I’m really happy with my purchase :)

  I have been looking at many models of laptops for gaming.  It was coming down to the blade, asus zephyrus m15 or the msi gs66.  I ended up with the blade because I just thought screw it and went with the most expensive one.  I have researched ALOT leading up to me deciding which to buy.  Ive seen and read the horror stories people posted on reviews and reddit about Razer's QC.  I also have seen very satisfied customers too so I prayed for the best.  Luckily my unit after I have been using for about 3,4 days now have no problem at all.  I see no major screen bleeding at all there is very small bleed on the right hand corner but basically that's it.The keyboards are not very to my liking.  I was using Lenovo Y520 before this and even on that cheap model, the keyboards were way better for me.  I think that the blade keyboards are abit too mushy for me.The speakers are also abit on the weaker side.  I wish they would just be a little more meaty.  I'm not sure how to explain it but even my old Lenovo was better and i hated those.The top part of the chassis near the screen gets VERY hot when under heavy loud like gaming.  I couldnt touch it for more than 3,4 seconds, but then again noone touches that area anyway so it doesnt really matter.  It also got cool to the touch very fast though after you stop gaming which really surprised me.All in all those are really the only thing I ""dislike"".  They really are nit picky but im actually really pleased with this device.  I will try to post here again if i encounter any problems later on.  For now i think they are great.  I also mostly see reported problems on last year's model with the i7 9th gen and this years 1660ti gpu model.  If I were you I would try to avoid those and get the more expensive one just in case.  All in all this is a good buy for me, just pray you get a good working model and you wont regret it!

  Shortly after arrival the laptop needed to be returned due to a fan issue.  It arrived back at the manufacturer one week ago.  Manufacturer support has been very polite in responding to my grandsons inquiries and informing him a new laptop would be sent.  He is disappointed and anxious and was told today that it will be shipped in 3-5 days.  He loved it for about 2 weeks before it had to be returned and what was supposed to be a special gift is now more concern than celebration.  As the purchaser, I'd like a definitive response to when it will arrive.  If that isn't possible, I'd prefer a refund for the laptop and the protection plan.

  Laptop is wonderful. well built, sleek and compact. the screen is beautiful and it runs very demanding games, albeit at pretty high temps. seriously gets hot, but it's a gaming laptop. only other gripe with the laptop itself is the rubber bumpers on the bottom are uneven and makes it wobble a bit. shouldn't be a terribly hard fix though.Amazon on the other had is what drags this review down. They have some false advertisements on the page. the main one being the store page says it has a touch screen, while it doesn't.  Had to talk to 4 reps trying to add the insurance to the purchase (store page says you can add it up to 30 days from purchase) only to be told they couldn't do it. 3 of the people just hung up without saying a word. The last one said all I can do to get what I wanted is to return the laptop, wait 2-3 weeks for amazon to receive it (even though I got it in one) and then wait another week for my refund, then repurchase the laptop and add the insurance. while I would like very much to do that, I need this laptop for work as well as gaming so I can't really be without it for so long.Oh, and as it's an expensive delivery, they require a signature for drop off. I took the day off and hangout waiting for the delivery only for the amazon driver to just throw it on my porch and leave without so much as ringing the bell.TLDR; laptop is great, purchase it if you see a decent sale, just don't bother purchasing through amazon. Too much hassle to deal with their incompetence.

  I could immediately tell from the packaging that Razer is not messing around. Everything was professionally packaged and upon opening, everything is high quality and created with love of gaming in mind.This computer runs great, plays all my games on max settings and doesn't get too loud. The screen, keyboard, speakers, trackpad, RGB, everything is top notch as I expected it to be. I bought a Bluetooth Razer mouse to go along with it and I now have the ultimate laptop gaming setup.Thank you Razer.

  This laptop was clearly not functional within an hour of setting it up.  It bluescreens constantly, and none of the typical things you'd do to diagnose and fix the bluescreens fixed it.  This included a total fresh reinstall of Windows as well as a number of software diagnostics recommended by Lenovo.  None of it worked.  This is clearly a hardware problem, so I returned it.  Amazon's return policy states that if they disagree with your assessment that the computer doesn't work, they'll charge you a fee ($165) for restocking.  That's what they did to me.  So they intend to sell you the same broken laptop they sold me.  Buyer beware!

  This is my 1st gaming laptop and I did a ton of research before pulling the trigger. For the price, it's a beast. Unfortunately mine is defective and drops 15-21% of frames in high resolution video playback. I bought it for 4k video editing as well as gaming so this is a BIG issue. I'm now wrestling with Lenovo to get it fixed or replaced. I 'd like to return it but at this point I wish I had researched the seller a little. Please don't misunderstand, their price was great, shipping was very fast but their return policy is so harshly rigid its clear they do not actually accept returns.  Words of warning: if you order from them, keep everything associated w your package and keep it in perfect condition. If you try for a return(good luck!) repack everything so that it looks as though the box was never opened, if not it will be rejected and you are paying shipping both ways. I will update this review once my machine is fixed or replaced.

  love the design not only is this laptop a beast at gaming ,but also looks and feels sleek and doesn't just look like a gaming laptop. The main games i play are rust and modern warfare , they run amazing at high settings. The fan noise isn't to bad either i have owned a older laptop before hand and that one was much much louder. screen is a bit small for me for gaming ,but thats because im used to a 27 inch monitor from my desk top. The only  thing i can think about disliking is the 512 ssd storage ,but you can always just unscrew the 11 screws on the bottom and plug a 2 tb ssd right next to it so not really a big deal. If you need a portable ,fast ,sleek gaming laptop this is the one for you.

  A vertical line appeared on the screen, I read reviews of the 1660ti variant and some users have had the same issue. I used this laptop very  lightly and carefully during 2 weeks, sometimes I opened it and the screen was black and sometimes I couldn't adjust brightness.

  The laptop shipped quickly.  It appears pretty sturdy, though a bit plasticky.  The keyboard is great, much better feel than my work laptop or my older samsung laptop.  The screeen is bright and sharp.  I'm impressed by the system speed.  Proper dual channel 3200MHz ram, fast 4800H cpu.  While running a few quick tests, the system was running 4.09GHz all core for the cpu-z stress test.  The fans are quiet and the keyboard and deck area were cool during ~20 minutes of gaming.  There are always better products on the horizon, but overall I'm pleased with this laptop.Update 5-10-21:  I continue to be impressed with this laptop.  It runs newer games very well and older games at ridiculous frame rates ( Portal and Talos Principle running at 200+ FPS).  The cooling system works very well and the integrated graphics can run many of my games at reasonable frame rates.  The battery life isn't that great, but long enough to watch a movie. Very pleased for the price.

  Laptop came factory sealed and in perfect condition. Beast Amd 2060 115w!*1 month update*I've traveled with it and used it pretty heavily and can say that this thing is amazing. Games run smooth, cyber punk on ultra with rtx on dlss on balanced I get about 55 fps, no rtx I can get 70+ on ultra. Temps are ridiculously low, gpu never goes over 70c at 97 to 99% performance. I'm coming from console so I was very skeptical of gaming on a laptop but I'm pretty sure I'll never buy a console ever again. After playing on ultra in a few games trying to play games on ps4 looks awful, I understand why pc players never turn back to consoles. This laptop provides the same games with better graphics at higher frame rates and its portable!

  This laptop has everything you need to game. RTX 2060 115W variant? Yes sir and also a chasis and cooling system good enough to handle it. AMD Ryzen 7 4800H? 8 cores and 16 threads? 4.2Ghz core speed? Oh yeah, best mobile CPU of 2020, yeah Intel i7 10750H can turbo 1 core to 5Ghz and gains like 3-5 FPS more, but its a 6 core CPU with heating issues unless you undervolt.

  This HP Chromebook looks and feels far more expensive and better made than its price led me to believe. The keyboard is outstanding with a soft but firm touch. My wife has never been a fan of touch pads, but she likes this touch pad so much that she no longer connects a mouse to use with this HP. The convertible and touch screen are just great added bonuses.We purchased this as an Amazon refurbished model and were thrilled that it actually did arrive ""like new"".

  I've been breaking in this puppy for a week now and feel motivated to write a review.  First off there are a couple of inaccuracies in the description--the computer DOES have a touch screen, and the RAM speed is 1600MHz, not 3200Mhz.  Beyond that all is described okay.I spent a couple of days burning in the computer with the freeware benchmarking program SiSoft Sandra Lite...no real surprises there.  The system outranked 87 percent of their database, with excellent scores for the processor, SSD drive and RAM (even though it's only 1600MHz).  It only garnered poor scores for its graphics, so if you're at all into 3D gaming look elsewhere.  For my uses it should be fine, though I would have liked to see a graphics score that wasn't bottom of the barrel.  My only other minor gripe is the color quality--initially videos appeared too dark.  I downloaded AMD's Radeon Software package, which allows me to adjust the brightness, hue and color temperature and I'm still dialing it in.So what do I like about it?  Lots of things.  I appreciate the backlit keyboard.  Though I use a mouse, the touchpad is better than many I've experienced.  The keyboard feel is good.  One reason I went for a 15-incher over a 14 was the numeric keypad, which I like.  Though I've used it very little so far, the touch screen simplifies some tasks.  I appreciate the full-HD 1920 x 1080 screen resolution--My last laptop was 1024 x 768 and this has much less eyestrain.  I like the 15.6"" screen much better than a 14"".  The screen is also visible from different angles.  I like the thin case and the light weight.  The 16GB RAM is overkill for me but it's nice to have it there for multi-tasking and video editing if I need it.This beast is a full-featured computer for well under $1000.  It's about the same price as those glorified tablets from Microsoft, Google and Apple with 10""-12"" screens, tiny drives and slower processors.  It hits a sweet spot in several areas for me...I spent a lot of time researching the purchase to include all the features I wanted.

  I found this laptop to be very snappy & high quality. The specs speak for themselves. The screen is beautiful & the touchscreen feature is nice to have. The battery life is excellent & this thing is very lightweight. It's a powerful Windows machine that doesn't sacrifice anything for its ultra sleekness. You will not be disappointed in the least.

  It has been like this for hours, can't shut down can't do anything! Haven't even used it for 2 days.... dont make the same mistake, sure its pretty and has slick design with decent specs, but I would never buy this again... other people in the reviews were right! Just pay little more and buy something proper

  What initially attracted me to the laptop was the price for the specs and processor offered. it's a durable laptop with a nice display and the laptop is very fast with an SSD. The fingerprint reader is also great I thought that was a nice touch. Unfortunately just like everything else in this world this item has flaws. The first flaw I would like to mention is it overheats very quickly.  Also, the battery isn't very good I assume the battery life is average though. It also isn't the best laptop for running games it does better on some games more than others. Just depends on what games you like. Granted, this laptop wasn't made for running games. Overall, I would still reccomend this laptop to a friend.

  I was so disappointed. This laptop had everything that I had hoped for except that the screen was so dim. Unfortunately I did return it because I couldn’t stand that even on full brightness it was lackluster. Other than screen brightness this laptop has it all.

  I needed a more powerful graphics card than my ancient desktop AiO for modern image processing software. This one fit the bill. One of the approved processors was a Radeon. Since I was getting a Radeon, I got a Ryzen 7 4700U. Plenty of power.My only real complaint is the micro SD card slot instead of a full size. I took an old 32 GB card and put it in as an additional drive. I use a USB adapter for full size SD cards. Waste not, want not.Add a wireless mouse and done. I'm still looking for a good prop to elevate the keyboard a bit. The power brick works. So does the umbrella from my briefcase. Both are a bit higher than I need, although the umbrella has a nice damped feel.5/12 Update: There were too many dongles, so I added:A bit more memory--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0887P21Z2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_3SB2H3CXT0H0F1JFN968?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1A Bluetooth mouse--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07C2NL5HK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_2RT9G4WET9CRGTEMPR1M?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1A USB-C card reader for full sized SD cards--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07ZKRM12C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_VYKCAADQWBETHN337JG1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

  I've only had this laptop for a few days so I am writing a review accordingly. So to start off, I'm not a huge tech person at all. I have a smart  Phone and have done everything from that period the last time that I had a laptop was probably  about 7 years ago.I recently started a business where I will be shipping products and printing invoices and  things of that nature. I knew I would either need a laptop or a desktop to do so. I figured a laptop would be perfect for now since its portable and I can take it anywhere.I initially ordered a chromebook off of Walmart.com and was so disappointed.  The screen and picture was so dim that it hurted my eyes. There was no way to adjust brightness.  There was no cap lock button and several other disturbing things...lol it went back the next day.Came to Amazon and saw this beautiful red hp laptop.  Took a chance and so far I'm loving it. Again,  I'm not a super tech gal or anything like that so I can't tell you how storage and all the specs will work. I like this laptop because it's semi huge. I'm a female with big hands and the keyboard is perfect for me.The Chromebook I sent back would load web pages super slow even when sitting right next to my modem.  As for this hp laptop, I'm out on my back porch and modem is upstairs and it's still loading with n0 problem at all.I wasn't quite sure what S mode was when I ordered it but it took 2 minutes to get it out of S mode. I went to gmail.com to check my emails and a message from gmail popped up in the right hand corner that said you are not using a Google browser and click her to get Google browser.  That's it that's all and my laptop is out of S mode.I have used it to create several word documents for my website so far.  Hooked up perfectly to my printer. Beautiful Color!! Keyboard is not backlight but its really nice so who cares. So far so good. Also shipping was really fast.  It was due on Wednesday but got her on Monday.

  My husband only likes HP computers. He had been wanting a laptop that he could use to pay bills, watch some youtube videos and surf the internet and not have to use his phone.I order this for him for Father's Day. It came in S mode but that was super easy to remove. The color is nice and its a nice size for viewing videos.

  I needed a notebook type laptop with built-in camera and audio to conduct meetings on Zoom, stream Netflix, surf/ browse the internet, compose Microsoft documents (I purchased and installed my own Microsoft office 2019)..... In other words nothing heavy duty/schmancy. Have had it a few weeks, is performing very well, good battery life lightweight and thin. Good screen quality/ resolution. It would be nice if the keyboard was backlit, but it's not.....

  It has been just over a month since I got it. For what I do, email, read articles, shop, play poker, this is a great machine. It came within a reasonable time. My only complaint is that it comes with Windows 10 S. It says it comes with Windows 10 (check the chart), but it was in the S mode. It seemed simple to remove or shut off but it would not and after repeated attempts and some foul language at the Microsoft site, I appealed to their Community and went to bed. The second response the next day solved the issue and after following the prompts I was able to get it out of S mode. Props to the Microsoft Community. Now I can add any App (hello Chrome, bye Edge) I want regardless of Microsoft's feelings. If the chart had been correct or this had come without the S Mode this would be a 5-star review.It is thin and has a large screen. It has a louder volume from the speakers than my older HP Pavillion. That is a good thing as the last one was not loud enough. It is also lighter than my last one and the battery lasts about 4x as long. If there is a fan I can not hear it, but there seems to be very little heat.  So far so good.

  Worse experience ever for two reasons..I was willing to pay for 2 day shipping and handling to get a laptop as quickly as possible..what I didnt realize is two day doesnt mean two days in seller and Amazon equation..mailed on 7/30 didnt receive until Aug 4th..open it up..doesnt work..hp support thinks it is adaptor or board itself..Never again..

  I bought this Dell laptop, and the day it arrived, the screen illumination dimmer stopped working, but only after I had dimmed it all the way down!  Then while was working, I saw an announcement that said something like, ""This computer is experiencing a problem,"" and it suddenly and without warning began a reboot!  Imagine if I had been on a Zoom call with a client!  Lastly, I decided to send the laptop back, and I've learned the seller charges a 10% restocking fee, and Amazon requires postage for the return (on a Prime item, nonetheless)!

  I am not interested in gaming or streaming movies, so I can't help with an opinion on those activities.  I am more into utilitarian things like internet access, spreadsheets, word processing and database.  Most of that comes along iwth MS 365, though I don't know if Access is included since I already had that in my subscription. Anyway, this computer came in good shape and a few days before promised and was all I expected.  Definitely acceptable and I'd recommend it for the sort of purposes I know about.

  This vendor (PCOnline365) had a laptop configuration that was what I wanted and at a price that was reasonable.  I bought it.  The process was easy and I was able to get it in a short time (not PRIME eligible).  I especially like not having it loaded with programs and applications I didn't want.  Their follow-up was polite and appropriate.  In the areas that matter - they exceeded expectations.  Recommended for your needs.

  Great overall.  This laptop is lightweight and slim, easy to travel with. Processor and memory are good and haven't seen any slowness in operation or applications.  Haven't noticed any overheating. Battery lasts, of course dependant of screen brightness and use. No problems so far.  Luckily, for the future, dell laptops are easy to work on if and when replacement parts are needed.  Will be planning on replacing the 1tb hd with a 1tb ssd.

  Loads Windows 10 (s-mode) quickly , about 25 seconds. Set screen brightness at 75% and tilt slightly back a little further than normal to correct washed out appearance. Battery life is running at about 7 hrs. with intermittent use. I did shut down all unnecessary apps from running in the background in the settings. I'm not a fan of Windows 10 s-mode which limits the user to apps from the Microsoft Store. You can switch to win. 10 home for free which does not require this limitation, however I have a 250 gb ssd in my unit so I have not switched and I'm trying to work with  the S-mode, I may switch sometime in the future. I do recommend this laptop for general use around the home, my only complaint is that the graphics could be better., Ok I used this laptop for about 2 more weeks and I would add that I have switched it out of the Windows 10 s-mode without any problems. There was no significant issue or change to the amount of used space on the 250 gb hard drive and it is operating normally in the Win 10 standard (home) mode which is a free switch so it will now accept apps from outside the windows store.

  My old 2012 ThinkPad, that I used for a few things to keep those things off my newer computer, finally died. I selected this Ideapad as a reasonable option for those uses.As most people know, ThinkPads have the best keyboard in the business. This machine can't meet that standard, but it is pretty good for a laptop. I'm a fast touch typists and I got along with it.The screen looks good but is only 1366x768 which isn't very inspiring for a 15 inch screen. This machine is not meant for gaming or high class photo and video editing!One very nice feature that many computer makers don't provide: The top row of keys has shifted options for various features of the computer. This machine, like most competitors comes set so the those extra options are not shifted. You have to press Fn+F key to get a function key to work. Not very good for people who know Windows short cut keys or who have software that regularly uses function keys. Fortunately this machine has an option in the BIOS to restore the keys to the proper function. I almost never use those extra key features but routinely use the actual function keys, so this makes the computer much more pleasant to use.In comparison to the old ThinkPad which I had downgraded to 4gig of ram and an old 360 gig HD, this machine is blazing fast with 12 gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD. It is also very slim and light so it is much easier to carry. However I was surprised it didn't charge via USB and the power brick has fixed prongs, not folding prongs. That is a minor complaint but still surprising. I haven't used it long enough to test the battery life.Big warning: This machine comes with Windows 10S which I thought I heard had been withdrawn by MS? If you don't want to be limited to using only apps from the Windows Store, be sure to Google how to switch from 10S back to Windows Home. I would have returned this machine if I couldn't switch back to real Windows 10.Also, if you prefer using local accounts on the machine, rather than a Microsoft Account, be sure to ignore the option to link to WiFi during the setup. Only if it doesn't have a network connection will it allow you to set up a local account. You can always connect to WiFi after finishing the setup.

  After spending a couple hours on initial setup, I attempted to install my primary software, and discovered that this machine came with Windows in S mode. Say what?  I had specifically bought this particular model over some other choices because it did NOT say it was coming with Windows S mode. So I figured, ok, no big deal. Switching out of S mode is supposed to be fairly simple. I follow the instructions on Microsoft's site, and it directs me to the Windows Store to get the ""Switch out of S mode"" app. Weird, but okay...So I try to ""get"" the app, and instead all I see is a vague error saying ""something happened and we couldn't start the upgrade"". Lovely.I tried for the next few hours everything I could find online to fix it, but with no progress.I called Lenovo, who basically told me to pound sand, unless I wanted to pay them for ""premium software support"". Oh no, I'm not paying you to get my brand new laptop working!I finally got on the phone with Microsoft directly, and spoke with a nice lady who was able to remote into the machine (using Quick Assist), and verify the error.After trying everything she knew (including setting up a new user account with a Microsoft account auto-login), she finally gave up and we performed a clean install of Windows 10 Home, using a custom config file she helped me inject into the iso file I downloaded from MS servers.So now my machine is finally up and running regular Windows 10 Home, version 20H2, without all the Lenovo bloatware.All-in-all, this was a truly painful process, and a complete waste of time. This machine never should have come with the pointless S mode enabled to begin with. I blame Lenovo for that, since I have 2 other Lenovo laptops (an S340 and another Ideapad 3), both bought within the past 6 months, and neither of them came in S mode.

  Negative- The battery lasts an only an hour even when in battery saving mode.  I'm constantly having to plug in.  Camera quality is very poor, looks extremely grainy and dark in virtual meetings.  Graphics are not great. Poor ventilation.Positive- touchscreen works properly, plenty of memory, good processor; moves pretty fast.  Overall, for the price I paid I am satisfied. I was not concerned about graphics when I purchase but disappointed mainly in the battery life.

  After my previous chromebook died, I was in a bit of a pinch to find something decently powerful with at least 4 cpu threads and 64gb of storage.this machine was the best value I could find at $250~. running chrome apps, the thing is quite snappy and responds well.6-8gb of RAM and a higher resolution screen would be my only two asks to make this into the perfect machine. other than these items, the computer does everything I need.I can run Steam Remote Play to play games from my desktop (little to no lag), with linux (beta) enabled, you can install flatpak and the flathub repo and use all the flatpaks you want. Most flatpaks work without issues, however some may be a bit buggy.Running AppImages also works fine, you just have to start them using the terminal emulator vs double clicking on them. (note you have to run chmod a+x to allow them to run).Running the Ultimaker Cura AppImage works well enough, but this doesnt quite have enough power to make it run the smoothest. Despite this, it will certainly get the job don if you are mildly patient and dont get click happy.Huge plus of this device is that the usb c ports are 3.1 and displayport 2.1. with the displayport 2.1 ports allow you to use a USB C docking station like the ""HP USB-C Dock G4"" docking station will allow you to use up to 3 displays (including the chromebook's built in display) at the same time.I did test this with a Dell WD19 docking station and can report that it will not output a display signal with that docking station despite all of the other functions of the docking station working.TL;DR not sure how I would have done better on short notice with similar money. I highly recommend this product if you are in the ""sub $300 - $350 chromebook"" price range.

  Took a very long time for the Google and security software to update. Was about to give up but then it magically completed the process and now this chromebook works very well. Keyboard is a little on the cheap side but for the price it is perfect for my son's remote learning. I have been able to load a couple of security related extensions to monitor my son's usage where the school computer would not allow me to do. Battery life appears to be as advertised. This chromebook serves its purpose.

  This computer is a renewed product, but I would never have guessed by looking at it or using it.  It arrived packaged as if it were brand-new.  It looks and operates as well as a new computer as well.  It charges fine and holds a charge too.  I have had it for a week and only charged it once.  I bought it to use in my graduate program and I already know it is going to be just what I wanted!

  Chromebooks are great for daily tasks on a budget. Choosing a refurbished product makes it an even better deal. I got this for my mother in law who needs to check email, watch some online videos, and play spider solitaire.

The display is nice (sharp, clear, and sufficiently bright) and the B&O sound system works great!

  It's as if I bought it new! Everything works great! Im so pleased with my purchase. I will purchase a couple more. The only annoyance so far is that the wifi disconnects if it powers down, sits too long without use, or when you use the mirror function. The wifi will disconnect in about 5 minutes of non activity.

  This was a great price for a refurbished device.I will say that it does exactly what I expected it to do.

  ive seen people say that the battery life isn't good, but I don't think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on, youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop. the picture quality is ecxcellent. the specs overall are great for under 1k. its upgradable. it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd.ive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on. ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO. with no use, the light goes off. all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they'll come back on. im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked. I actually prefer that to minimize battery use.while using without gaming, the battery life is actually pretty good.so far ive played terraria and fallout 76, and they both play great on ultra settings. I think im going to install battlefield 5 and see how it runs. not a big fan of the game itself, but that's the most resource intense game I own, kinda curious how itll run.the laptop is more than vr readyI love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing.oh, ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving.... mine didn't either, YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY, LOLoh, and I also received the laptop within a day and a half. ordered friday night, and got it sunday.overall I highly recommend

  Being an electronics technician and having built many computers over the years, I have hot to say that the pavillion line of gaming computers is the best bang for your buck that I have seen in years. I have owned many different laptop brands and my HP laptops last the longest with the least problems. I am not a bigtime FPS gamer like I used to be but I can play world of warcraft on full graphics without any video lag whatsoever.

  I was able to run Sims 4 and all of my expansion and game packs with no issues whatsoever. The game now starts quick and loads faster. It’s great for both gaming and school work. I like the thin, sleeker design. The battery is pretty good depending on what you’re doing and the light up keyboard allows me to see what I’m doing even in dimly lit rooms. I’ve had no issues whatsoever with it. Very happy I bought this laptop

  This has been a great computer, plays everything that I've thrown at it, not at top specs but more then enough for me.  Thermal control is better then expected, it can be a little loud but nothing near my last asus ROG machine.  I upgraded to 16GB ram and windows ran better but didn't notice a ton in games.Pros:-Bang for your buck-USB-C-easy to upgrade-Looks like a gaming laptop without being obnoxious-Power brick is really compact for this type of computerCons:-The middle hinge is a little scary, you have to open it from the middle.  If you open it with the corners it flexes the screen a lot.-Wish the power button was on the side so I don't have to open it when it's plugged into my monitor-Battery life is good for a gaming laptop but realistically 3-4 hours of normal use.  1-2 hours of gaming maybe.-USB-C isn't thunderbolt

  So as you all know, earlier this year I bought the HP Pavilion Gaming 15 core i5-8300H and had a hiccup that was resolved if you read my review on that one.  This time I bought the newer core i5-9300H model for a friend and I must say I love this new design.  It has larger vents for better air flow; 2 settings for the light in the keyboard (dim and bright green); the monitor is a bit more sturdy then the first which is a plus.  Overall this machine is definitely a 5 out of 5 for the price bracket.

  Pretty good, for those that are wondering. When I received this laptop, it only arrived with an M.2. No sata. Housing for the sata, but no sata only a blank box so the housing could mount. Still a solid computer, good for gaming and strong fans. Easy maintenance, thermal pads and paste are easily accessible. All though this was bought at walmart and everyone including these people have upped the price, but still a solid computer for the extra $200+ they slapped on it. This is an hp originally sold at walmart for around 545 dollars. Hope this review is helpful, enjoy the laptop.

  Aspire 5, Ryzen 3, Vega 3 Graphics, 16GB RAM DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD:On mine, the upgraded boot SSD came as a Kingston and the memory modules were Crucial brand. I was happy to see brand names that I recognized.I installed an expansion 1GB WD Blue SSD myself and am extremely happy with this little PC. The boot SSD does indeed run at NVMe speeds, 1646/929 MB/s sequential read/write. The WD Blue SSD that I installed runs 392/303 MB/s. I am pretty sure that the motherboard is the limiting factor on these speeds.The Windows 10 Task Manager shows the GPU as having reserved 2GB of RAM and is sharing 7GB Ram with the system. That seems reasonable to me.You can just buy the base model Aspire 5 and add all of this stuff yourself, saving some serious $. I had already upgraded the boot NVMe SSD on a different PC and just did not want to deal with that again, too many headaches for me getting Windows 10 uefi BIOS set up. The RAM and additional SSD are fairly simple DIY projects. This was a good purchase for me.

  I have zero negatives about this laptop or seller. As everyone does I researched the hell out of laptops before I made my purchase. The best recommended product was this exact Acer laptop & Thrilled it was selling on Amazon, MY FAV!I also made certain to read as many reviews as possible here on Amazon before putting my money down. I have never been happier purchasing a laptop. It came earlier than scheduled & packaged like new so I am giving high marks to the seller!It was larger than the company laptop I was working on but thinner & lighter, Yeah! The set up took less than 20 minutes & I have been loving it ever since. I highly recommend this laptop even if you have a large budget to spend.I did spend the extra money to get the warranty but did not purchase any of the additions they recommend, ie office, adobe, etc. Since I read the reviews & saw how many people were unhappy with them I chose not to purchase & happy I didn't. I have not needed any additions, my Acer has everything I need already built in.

  this computer is expensive to get the bigger hard drive 1TB. and it comes loaded with old software from2014 mostly and is STUCK in Windows ""S MODE"". sure there are ways that are SUPPOSED to remove it but they dont work - so you are stuck with lots and lots of Microsoft pop=ups constantly trying to sell you things thru Microsift Store AND bombarding your email which you must provide to activate Windows at all.  S MODE allows you opnly to add apps that are sold and ""approved"" by Microsoft. I've been thru all of their help garbage, talked to them and Acer, but still stuck in S Mode. its crap. its annoying. I'm not paying Microsoft for every little thing I may want to add to this computer- It doesnt even let you run Microsoft Office with paying for an additional upgrade.  almost $700 to have my privacy constantly invaded and my every movement tracked. ridiculous. stay with your old laptop and just upgrade the hard drive and save yourself 100's of dollars.

  The other reviews do not understate the quality of the webcam - it is horrendous. Much lesser of quality than I would expect for a $1600 2020 laptop.Love the keyboard. I'm a mechanical-keyboard type of person, and while I typically hate low-profiles, I liked the keyboard on this laptop enough that it was the decision-making factor when it came down to a few options. Handles smaller games great, professional looking and would recommend to anyone using it for non-webcam related purposes.Update: Some serious graphical glitches came with this laptop. It's behaving like motherboard failure. Seems like this is a problem with XPS's in general. Returning and not chancing it - I suspected the laptop was a return to begin with, and the packaging was pretty badly damaged when it came (previously ripped open multiple times). I still like the laptop, but I'm replacing it with a unit from the manufacturer.

  I received an open box product. It struggled to function with a wireless mouse and keyboard combo via USB hub.  Several times it crashed if I unplugged it and closed the lid.  Also, recently the fingerprint reader and IR camera for face recognition are no longer recognized.  too many issues in the first two weeks to keep.  However, i am very happy with the laptop as a whole and will be ordering from Dell.  I am sorry that Amazon would send an open box of an obviously defective product to a long-time consumer, especially at this price point.Sorry to return. I saw several other reviews about open items.

  I’m not too keen on this. It’s the same computer as the one I bought in 2017 except it’s different. One thing I loathe is that I needed to buy a dongle so I could hook up my monitor, my keyboard, and my mouse. Didn’t have to on the other one. The fingerprint reader is finicky, which is annoying because I keep logging in and getting that error message, but my biggest issue is the keyboard. Idk what they did with it, but it’s not chiclet style like the older model it’s almost too flat for my preference it feels like I’m going to break the keys. And the hinge feels subpar kind of cheap. Just not happy that I paid all the money for this.

  Purchased fully loaded, Dell XPS 13 (11th gen).  Everything as expected EXCEPT the micro SD slot does not allow the micro SD card to eject.  After researching on the web, this has been reported to Dell as a problem on the XPS 13 (9300 series) as early as 2019;  obviously still a problem.Updated 5-May-21:  Never Dell again.  Sent to Dell for repair, Dell said that, as the microSD port on the Motherboard was damaged, and as not covered by BASIC warranty, I had to pay 259 plus tax to get repaired.  I am having them return the laptop, and am investigating how to return to Amazon as ""received as damaged"".

  The good: I like the back lit keyboard, the fast, quiet solid state memory, the long battery life, the big 15.6 screen.  Used as a simple school or business tool it is a perfectly good computer.The not great: The 4gb ram is a limiting factor on this unit.  You cannot ever install additional ram to handle modern software or games, as it has no slots for ram at all. The 4gb ram is simply soldered in to the unit.Be aware of this when making this purchase.On the plus side, You can easily greatly expand on the 128gb solid drive by plugging in an internal m.2 SSD card.  An empty m.2 slot is provided. The speed of this computer is only slow when used for multi tasking with intense business software. Regular use is fine, in fact its pretty snappy with good performance. I did have to disable the windows 10 S mode. Disabling 10S is a built in option, allowing a return to regular windows. 10s would not function with the business software and non microsoft add ons I require. I am now running regular windows 10 with no issues.

   The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you're using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. I'm evaluating my replacement options right now but it seems it's hard to get an unit without this or worse issues.Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works.Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue.Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is really bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google: ""flex to click xps 9500"").

  I love everything about this laptop except for the webcam; it is embarrassingly bad. Like...really REALLY bad.

  This laptop is fantastic, and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  But let's talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: ""Is this a new product?"".  Given the $2000 price tag, it's only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving.  I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself.For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before.  With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival.  The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place.Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from ""Dell Returns"" located in Lebanon, Tennessee.  So I did some quick investigating.  I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee.  These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns.  Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these ""new unused"" products at a cheaper price tag.  So yes, I believe this product is ""NEW"", but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards.  This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of.For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon.  Now, considering all of these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL!  You are getting Dell's UHD+ touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro.  If you were buying this same laptop configuration off of Dell's official website, it run you close to ~$2500.  On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on a Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly.  The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel.  The display is gorgeous and crisp.  The touchscreen is super responsive.  The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop.  I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having.Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning pretty hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings.  Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks.  I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender.  And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is definitely a fingerprint magnet lol.All in all, this laptop is absolutely stunning.  The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out.

  I was a little nervous reading reviews that stated that computers come used, not working etc. I can confirm that Amazon delivered to me a pristine machine - working perfectly, is new and exactly to the spec Amazon advertised. Very happy with the purchase. I purchased UHD+ Touchscreen 10th gen i7 - the screen is perfect, on par or better than new MacBook Pro that I also use. Overall new XPS 15 is well designed, solid machine with fast processor and outstanding UHD+ screen. I also like that I can upgrade it to 64GB or RAM for about $300 (2933MHz DDR4 CL17 SODIMM Laptop Memory).P.S. For non technical people, please run both Dell updater (lots of drivers / bios updates there) and Windows updates.

  I love everything about this laptop... EXCEPT THE WEBCAM. I bought this to conduct telehealth sessions and this one thing matters more than anything and it's the one truly horrible thing about it. I look blurry, pixelated, and ghost-like. I spent a lot of money on this and now I have to buy a Webcam.

  I had a chromebook for a couple of years because it was cheap.  When I finally got tired of the limitations of that laptop I started searching on-line for the best reasonably priced computer.  I looked at all the big name models  with touch screen and without.  My wife had an ASUS for several years and I was impressed with the features.  When I saw this one with a 17 inch screen, solid state storage, fast processor and windows 10 not 10S I jumped on it.  I bought it for less than $500.  Can't beat that.  Couldn't get a better one cheaper at Costco.

  In the past two months I have purchased and returned a Lenovo (highest volume was maybe HALF of any other computer I've had and boot up was incredibly slow); an HP (despite reload of Windows10 with HP tech giving instructions by phone, still couldn't get laptop to recognize internal DVD drive and I bought it to load music on to) and now I have come to the conclusion I need to return this ASUS. I only kept it this long because I just could not believe I was in this position for a third time... WTF?!!This VivoBook17 crashes at least once a night EVERY NIGHT. I think it has to do with the auto updates. It freezes for as long as 5 minutes and Ctrl/Alt/Del does not work. Maybe I should call ASUS support but I'm so disheartened, I may not waste my time. If something brand new doesn't work properly, do you want to fix it or do you want something that is perfect right out of the box? I returned the Lenovo to Office Depot up the street. I had to pay $40 to return the HP to an Amazon seller who did not provide for free returns. This one was purchased from Amazon so I am hopeful the return will be free.I bought this laptop because I wanted the largest possible screen (17.3) for my heavy-use streaming (Hulu, Netflix, Prime, HBO, etc.). I also wanted to finally load all my music on one of my computers and it might as well be the newest one. This one is going back but here's how I would rate it:Pros: the screen is large enough for good viewing, the color and clarity are sharp and the volume is great. It boots up quickly and I like the large keyboard buttons. I like that the weight is moderate and not too heavy. The appearance is okay, although I like the look of my old (2013) red ASUS better. My old ASUS had TERRIBLE wireless connectivity and I was happy to find this one had no connectivity issues.Cons: I HATE Windows10 and I believe the issues with this computer are due to the OS and not the equipment itself, but I am not a tech expert and I don't care WHY the problem is, I only want a working and reliable laptop with a 17-inch screen. So here I go back to shopping. Don't know if I'll stick with ASUS or try a fourth brand since, apparently, getting a good product has more to do with luck than with brand name or reputation.

  Computer boots fast and operates quickly. Those are pluses. The big negative for me is the battery life. I have had the computer for just about two weeks, and the longest it has stayed on with a full battery is 90 minutes. That's inconvenient when I am in a meeting that lasts more than that time.

  Seems great, everything installed correctly and booted up normally. Bought this laptop for my father who is going to be using it for work after having back surgery.Laptop is nice in size, but the reason I rated it only 2 stars is because there is a mark on the top side of the laptop which makes me believe this is a used model? I’ve never purchased a tech item that is scratched before, and the listing showed new.Pretty disappointed and cannot return due to this taking almost a week to get to me and he needs it for work. Next time I will look somewhere else for a laptop.

  Product description says this has backlighting for the keyboard; it does not. The lettering is difficult-to-impossible to read in any kind of lighting. Looking at the keyboard it is easy to believe it was INTENDED to have backlighting in the original design but someone forgot to include it in the construction. To 'see' the letters, I had to shine a flashlight at an angle to the keyboard. Tech support responded this was not a glitch, the computer doesn't have it. Can't say much about other features as this was a deal-breaker, and I re-boxed it shortly after starting it.

  I've had this laptop for a couple months now. Here are my pros/cons, especially where the laptop differs from my expectations. Overall I'd definitely recommend this laptop to people, though.The screen is great. I love the full HD 1920x1080 resolution. At 15"" that's a bit dense, and if your eyes are getting old you may find things too small. But it's a beautiful screen overall! Bright, high contrast, sharp.The solid state drive and lots of RAM make this very fast. I can't believe how fast it boots.The power button feels flimsy. This button is not going to last 10 years if I'm pressing it every day. Mostly I put it in ""sleep"" mode when not using it, and can wake it with any key on the keyboard. I end up using the actual power button maybe once every week or two, so hopefully that makes it last longer.Sometimes when I put it in ""sleep"" mode, it wakes up on its own. I don't understand why. It's probably some setting somewhere. I did discover that the external USB mouse I had attached was automatically configured to be a device that can wake the laptop from sleep, if the mouse moves. I disabled that, and that reduced how often the laptop wakes up on its own, but didn't entirely eliminate it.The keyboard is generous, for a laptop. It even has the 10-key on the right side. Some of the key placements are not what I'm used to, but laptop keyboards always make compromises. And the keys are very comfortable. The function keys (F1-F12 across the top) default to a *different* use (e.g., bright/dim the screen, volume up/down, etc.) and to use them for traditional F1-F12 functions (e.g., F2 = rename, F5 = refresh, etc.) you have to hold down a new ""Fn"" key down by Ctrl/Shift/Alt. I find this unfortunate because 9 times out of 10 I want the F1-F12 functions, not the others.The laptop has 4 rubberized feet on the bottom. However, when you flip up the screen, the hinge extends downward and actually lifts the laptop up off its back two rubberized feet. This is obviously by design, but wow that's a weird design. The laptop spends most of its time sitting on the hinge in the back, and the front two rubberized feet.Only two USB ports is a bit of a disappointment. I immediately bought two Sabrent 4-port USB hubs, one for each laptop port. Now I'm good to go at home, and when on travel I rarely need even the two built-in ports. Having USB-3 speeds is sure nice if you have external hard drives or other devices that can handle it!Only one HDMI port (and no other external monitor port) makes it hard to have this laptop drive two big monitors. I had to end up with one external monitor plus the built-in screen, which I don't like because they are such different sizes. There are external USB-C ""docking"" stations that solve this, but I have not tried one.

  First laptop I've bought and I must say I'm very disappointed. I bought it because of the Specs yet it doesn't perform much different from a $300 laptop. It froze completely on the 1st day just playin a game called League Of Legends for those who don't know its not even a game that requires much power to run yet it has happened several times(I have videos). Now overall the laptop lags from time to time specially when I plug in the charger which on top of it the battery is not that great but I could live with that. The Laptop is updated I have good internet and I've only had it for like 2 weeks now. Build quality is nice but that's about the best thing about it, for the cost it falls short on every other aspect. I'll look for options when it comes to returns cause I'm definitely not satisfied.

  I really wanted to love this laptop, as the specs for the price are a great value. However, the fan is very loud and it wouldn’t stop running... and it was brand new! I called HP and they suggested that I ship the laptop to them and I would get it back in 2-3 weeks. Who can be without a computer for that long nowadays? Not me! Anyway, I returned it. :( Still shopping for a new laptop now.

  MAJOR SCREEN ISSUES, see other reviews.  Touchpad is comparable to popping the bubble in the board game “Trouble”.  Extremely unresponsive (have to press hard to register a click) and inconsistent (clicking in the same spot will register a click one minute, nothing the next).  Screen is very dark after setting all possible brightness to maximum.  Very dark when placed side by side with my 3 year old HP.  Simple game with no lag on 3 yr old HP lags on this one.  If you don’t use Microsoft email the email interface is the most basic I have ever seen, you are better off going to through the browser.  The keyboard layout is very awkward; they shifted everything left and off center in order to add a number pad on the right (there are still numbers above the letters.  Before you buy, line you hands up centered, at a normal laptop, then slide them 3 keys to the left and see how that feels.  Mid-range price wise but serious design/usability issues.

  Good performance.  Annoying HP bloatware.  Bought to do video editing and it excels at that.  Fast boot.  Decent keyboard.  Paired with blutooth Logitech M585 mouse that works well (only 2 regular USB ports).  My main complaint is the misleading USB-C port.  Yes it will connect and charge my cell phone,  but any $3 hardware store adapter could do that!  I bought a USC-C to HDMI cable to support a 3rd monitor... worthless...NO display thru USC-C, just data or charging.  I have bought HP for decades but this is just ""made in China"" mediocre crud that I  wouldn't have purchased had I  known. Last test will be to connect to 4k/3820dpi monitor thru HDMI port.  If it can't do that,  it will be Ebay ""dump it"" computer.  There is no DVD player/ recorder but they are  $25 at Walmart for LG / USB unit that worked well.  Windows 10 has no software to play a DVD  movie so hunt for that.  Price?  3x price any laptop I ever bought as I like desktops for a REAL computer. Fast enough.  Hope it lasts. Apparently laptops are in short supply this year... this is better than most but it's still a compromise.

  Set it up initially and went through Windows update to make sure I had the latest versions of everything. After about two weeks, Win 10 would say the Bluetooth  hardware was not installed even though it had been working properly.  Tried reloading drivers through Win 10, but it said I had the latest drivers. Eventually tried the Dell support site and downloaded their SupportAssist. It loaded different drivers than the Win 10 ones and that fixed my problem.  Don't understand why the laptop didn't come from Dell with the correct drivers. Also would have saved me a lot of time if the SupportAssist was already on the laptop and available to use.

  Love this laptop.  Had a 8 to 10 year old Dell and when I got this new one I was prepared to take some time to adapt.  Not at all!  Only a few things gave me pause, but overall I went straight into using it as if I had had it for years.  I am 7over 70 so it was a very welcome experience.  I love this laptop and with the addition of a separate disc drive, it is perfect.  It is much lighter than my old one, too which is a big plus. The display is great, and since I do a lot of Zoom, I appreciate the camera quality and the sound.  The storage size is much greater than I will ver use, and since it was such a small increase over the smaller storage, I was really happy to be able to afford it.

  This has been the absolute worst buying experience that I’ve had in years. I order this on July 27th and it arrives in a timely fashion on the 29th. After three hours of the mildest use possible (loading programs, etc - getting it ready for an editing job), it is dead. Simply plugging the power supply into the laptop will shunt the power supply, forcing the power supply itself to shut down.Dell was and has been utterly useless to talk to. Amazon has been running me around in some recursive “support” loop for 13 hours now. I’ve offered at least five times to hand deliver this defective laptop to the Amazon facility that shipped it, in return for a new non-defective unit. “Support” has been all but supportive. I am going to lose this job over this.If this problem isn’t rectified by the morning of August 4th, I’m going to dispute the charges against my card and let Amazon and Dell bicker over who will come and get this expensive doorstop.

  Update: Returned the laptop. Would constantly overheat and shut off within 15 minutes of moderate gaming. Can't call this a good gaming laptop if the laptop can't property handle the hardware.This laptop has quite an impressive spec sheet for the price, but with some issues within an hour of unboxing, I'm not sure if the laptop will last.The laptop came out of the box without WiFi drivers, so I had to run to the store and grab an ethernet cable to finish setting it up online. After a few programs and Windows updates installed, I restarted the PC and got a Bitlocker recovery screen requiring me to input the key. I thought ""Okay, good thing I went online and signed in with my MS account"" and got all that fixed.After installing two more programs (MS Office and Notepad++), I restarted my PC and got an light error code (power light blinked 7 times white, 2 times amber) and looked it up online, which told me it was some LCD screen failure. After about 15 minutes of just letting it sit there thinking of what I'd have to do, it started up fine and is working without any further issues now. I have no idea how it fixed itself, but somewhere in those 15 minutes it figured out how to turn itself back on I guess.I've had a number of issues in the first 4 hours of having it today, and am a bit afraid of it just not turning on some day with how it's going so far. I'd say it's a good price, but the hardware/software is abnormally horrible for a new PC.  Only other grievance I've noticed so far is how hot it can get on the bottom of the PC. I know it has a dedicated graphics card in it, but coming from my previous PC (the Dell Inspiron 15 5000 5577), it never got too hot to touch & was very quiet.

  It's taken me a week or so to fully digest the functionality and pros/cons of this laptop. Overall, if you read the product description (and know anything about electronics) it's pretty straight forward what you're getting. That being said, I feel it's important to outline a few cool features as well as drawbacks you may overlook.Initial Impression: Materially, this is a really solid piece of equipment. Though somewhat heavier than I expected, this is typical with a gaming laptop. The power adapter is massive however, and unnecessarily so. I don't know if this has anything to do with requiring more energy for intense gaming, but it's literally a quarter the size of the laptop itself. The keys are backlit (which can be turned on and off with the press of a button), and there are ports for virtually everything you could imagine. The screen itself is somewhat of a matte texture which is something I'm not used to, but after a few hours of use I appreciated how it prevents glare. As with most laptops, the brightness is adjustable on the keyboard - something to take into consideration when trying to preserve battery life. That being said, startup was a nightmare... but this was due largely in part to my internet being down - an essential requirement to get up and running. I'm very much a ""plug and play"" kind of guy, so you can imagine my frustration when the computer repeatedly froze on a black screen until I was able to get online to download essential updates and software components (all of which should be pre-installed for a device this new). Trying to add a secondary user was equally frustrating as it also needed to re-download many of the same components as my setup, once again freezing repeatedly. Once past all the initial turmoil, everything was a breeze.Extended use: After a full charge, the battery lasted roughly 2.5-3 hours while I browsed the internet and worked on documents. With streaming and game play, the battery life is surprisingly close to the same (roughly 2 hours depending how much multi-tasking you're doing). The dual fan system is incredibly quiet and kept the laptop from heating more than say your average smartphone after prolonged use.Cortana is your virtual assistant (similar to Siri). While she is accessible from your desktop, you can also enable ""Hey Cortana"" in the settings which will allow her to respond to voice commands.Link your phone using the edge app. This allows you to sync browsing history, favorites, and alternate seamlessly between devices (simply by logging into your Microsoft account). It is worth noting the functionality for Apple products is more limited than Android (which allows you to see/sync SMS, MMS, pictures, and video). I have an iPhone, so I cannot personally attest to whether or not the additional Android features actually work, but the information showed up while setting up my device.Game Shift, a function controlled by a button on your keyboard, is said to increase the fan speed to cool the processor, and prioritizes game data over annoying popups or background apps (and updates). Basically, it is supposed to optimize the resources needed during gaming (processor, video card, memory, etc). I attempted to test this function with several games and did not notice a difference or receive the on-screen prompt that it was working. Perhaps I need to update a driver for this? It wouldn't surprise me given the number of essentials I had to install during setup. That being said, the gaming I did was pretty seamless and ran without issues.It's worth mentioning there is no CD/DVD drive. I completely overlooked this prior to ordering, and the vast majority of my software is on discs. This is easily resolvable with an external drive which costs virtually nothing nowadays.The webcam has an indicator light next to it to ensure privacy (so you know when it's on). The resolution is average, but consistent with other laptop cams on the market.Lastly, a few quick notes. As an avid gamer and video editor, I will say one thing I found discouraging is the computer's memory. Though this is something easily resolved with an external drive, all of these ""plug in"" devices begin to defeat the purpose and simplicity of a laptop. Additionally, the included manual indicates a fingerprint reader on/by the power button... this is NOT a standard feature with all G3 models.Summary: When utilized for office use (or basic functionality) this laptop is superior in terms of speed and software capabilities. For standard gaming it's average, and for the professional gamer it might be underwhelming in some of the areas outlined above. Still, when put to the test it's a reliable laptop that I'd consider a nice addition to Dell's product line.

  I've had the laptop for about a week know and it's been working great. The screen is really good, my previous laptop had a 60hz screen and the difference is definitely noticeable, if it were a bit brighter it'd be perfect.  I've mostly been playing borderlands 3 on it, running the visuals on high. The game runs smoothly, the only catch is that the laptop gets pretty warm. So if you're planning on gaming with this machine I'd definitely recommend a laptop stand.

  Best laptop I have owned.  A lot of tech for the money.  Runs smoothly no matter the task.  Games like Microsoft Flight Sim and Halo run great.  I don’t find that it gets too hot.  Fans spin up, but that is expected.  Beautiful screen.  I had low expectations here, so surprised. Movies look amazing.  Very user upgradable.  I added a second HD (1 TB).  I upgraded to 32G RAM.  Super easy.  Battery life is just ok, but didn’t expect too much from a gaming laptop.  Keyboard and backlight is nice.  Dell software for updates and maintenance is a nice plus.  Alien Software also a nice surprise,.  Laptop is nice just for web browsing, personal/business work and when want to play games it performs.  Highly recommended.  I like the design.  Plenty of ports and I find they are well placed.

  Got this for my wife since she needed a new laptop BADLY, and was starting a new job where she wouldnt have her work laptop for about a month after her start date. This machine is plenty fast, the screen is very good quality and the laptop is thin and light. Everything you would need in a laptop you need for work or travel. My wife absolutely loves the laptop and being the tech nerd husband, I was the one who picked out the options based on specs and she picked out the style/color/size and everything else about it. The Ryzen 7 4700u is the best ultrabook low powered processor on the market, 8 cores 8 threads, and with 16gb of RAM your ready to go in handling all of the normal tasks youd need to with ease. I especially recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a powerful machine, but likes the lightweight and small size convenience to be able to take it with you when traveling no problem.

  It's taking some time getting use to it, since I had a15.6"".  I'm use to having the numbers on the right side of keyboard, big adjustment. Dislike the type c charging cable since it has a round point power port. Have no use for the HDMI port.  Wish it had a Ethernet port instead. Only 2 USB ports, I bet the cable mfg love it selling adapters and docking ports, and adapters. I don't use it for games, and haven't tried touch screen. Over all I like the unit beats the old HHD. Like the flexibility of it make it a tablet. So many things I wish to try.

  I bought this laptop so I could work at places other than my office. My more device-savvy kid picked the laptop and the specs, so if you’re looking for a technical review, this isn’t it. I’m running Office in whatever version they’re calling it these days. 365? My bread & butter is running QuickBooks Desktop (QBDT) and that program can be a bit of a resource hog. My new ThinPad has handled it beautifully. I liked that I could add the Lenovo app and customize my settings even more than what windows offers. This laptop is super light and thin - she’s practically a supermodel. I love that I can toggle a slide and a red dot shows me the camera is closed. The slide is a little hard to see because it’s black in black so I took a metallic silver sharpie and marked it. Problem solved. I like the feel of the 10-key, but I have smaller hands. Someone with larger hands might not find it roomy enough. The matte surface is pretty, but it definitely shows fingerprints. I was cleaning the cover pretty much daily. That got old quick so I got a cute skin. Always a work around.  Keep in mind, I’m not an expert, I’m an end user and I think this laptop  will do nicely. When the box arrived the charger was missing. I immediately emailed the seller and they sent one right out. Mistakes happen, but they were very responsive.

  Bought this computer for personal use, No Gaming, No Video watching, Just for internet access, occasional Word and Excel use.  Within the first hour of use, I got an error message "" Critical Process Died"" message, and everything froze up.  Had to turn the computer off and restart which cleared the message and allowed me to use it again.  Now I can't run for more than an hour without it CRASHING again and again with the same error message.  After searching the web for user blogs, I found that this problem has been around for years with Lenovo products.

  My order arrived on time and was undamaged.  Great purchase, had no issues with upgrades or connection to wifi. I was able to immediately use the Thinkpad, missing the longer battery life. The computer starts quickly and was able to download 57MB in a few minutes.  Note it's a bit older so not an intel Core i7 or fingerprint unlock functionality.  Otherwise, it's a pretty decent purchase for business computer.

  I got this computer specifically for the keyboard.  4 months into it, the bracket breaks on my ""k"" key.  It's under waranty, so Lenovo will fix it, but it will take 3+ weeks and I won't be able to wor.  I can't get a loaner, because I didn't purchase the laptop directly from Lenovo, so I have no way to mae a claim.  It's pretty frustrating.  Outside of an obscenely long repair job from the manufacturer, the seller who purchased it (Issaquah Highlands Tech) from Lenovo is washing their hands because it lasted more than a month (lol) which is the minimum that amazon requires (lol).  So I would avoid using this seller, and I would advise considering buying directly from the manufacturer purchases like these.  This is my second Lenovo, the first being a Yoga 910 that lasted many years.  The eyboard on this one lasted 4 months, and that's specifically why I got it.  Pretty frustrating to say the least.Also, the camera is very low quality, the screen is not very bright at certain angles, and while the layout of the keys is very nice, the quality of the eyboard is questionable at best.  If I could do it over, I would definitely not have chosen this computer or this seller.

I only got this laptop was because my computer tech son did the research for me and suggested it.

  The unit I received (16GB RAM, 512 GB NVME SSD) was unable to wake up after going to sleep due to idle. If you use the [Start]->Power->Sleep menu option in Win10, it was able to wake up. This was also a 1st gen E15, not the latest 2nd Gen E15 that is widely available. The SSD was an aftermarket brand ""OEM Genuine"" with what appears to be a solid Silicon Motion controller. Otherwise the keyboard was comfortable and the design looks and feels sharp. I am just very disappointed with the inability to wake up from sleep - and I wonder if this has anything to do with the aftermarket upgrades.

  It's a good laptop. I was nervous because of the 4 GB and worried it will run slow. I had to download Zoom and had to switch out of S mode....then I realized the computer was running extremely slow. Then I found out you can't actually go back to S mode....so then I restarted it and it was running fine. So do not switch out of S mode unless you REALLY have to. You get what you pay for.

  I bought this laptop for a little over 400$, but it can be boightten new at Walmart for a little over 200$. I've only used it twice and so far I've had trouble getting it to come on and now my wifi will not connect, won't even pull up and wifi networks to connect to. Also the camera is really blurry/crappy. Is a very thin, cute, weightless laptop though.

It's impossible to get red color one in Japan,so I'm very happy and enjoy this laptop. And renewed is almost like new one. No problems. Great purchase.Thank you very much.

  I'm very impressed with this laptop being that is a renewed product. I've got the 128GB SDD and for what I need it is perfect. The condition is like new, literally, like new. Way faster than your classic HDD.

  So i finally found what i was looking for. I haven't had a laptop since my oldest son ""Borrow"" it, so close to 4 years. but mom's do that.  So when i opened the box the color of it Had me right there. a beautiful Red. i was scared to get it out but i finally did and have been on it constantly. Easy to use perfect size (for me) it is a beautiful wonderful laptop. It came with all the bells and whistles. and is easy to load new apps. has up to date apps also. But i did my research and wanted an HP. they are reliable constant and keeps growing.

  This was a gift for my papa & he loves it! His computer was like 15 years old so he needed an upgrade. So far it’s been perfect since all he does is check emails and social media along with some online shopping

  I had a 2016 MBP and noticed that when editing 4k video it was almost impossible. I am not an editing pro but its been a hobby for 18 years. I was very hopeful that upgrading to the new M1 chip would help that. my old computer was only an 8Gig so I upgraded to a 16Gig. even though Adobe PP does not support the M1 chip yet. it still was lightning fast. rendering video that used to take 4 hours now take on average 20 min. Now when I think about doing a video project I get excited and not discouraged. If you are looking for an upgrade. you will not be disappointed.

  What was once a difficult thing to accomplish on a Mac is now a dream! This thing plays games just like you would on your ps4. Comparable quality for sure. Not sure about ps5 since I don’t own one. But definitely enjoy it now as much as playing on my ps4.

  This thing is complete garbage. I bought it for my dad, and I spent an hour setting it up, but it immediately disabled the touchpad (as in completely wiped it from the system). Any effort to restore it failed, so I had to do a complete reset on it just to get back one of the most basic features of any such device.This is the last time I will ever buy a Lenovo product. Not remotely worth the frustration.

  The 10th gen i3 gets the job done. We're not using it for gaming; just needed a replacement for my wife's aging Chromebook. It's super snappy and smooth with everyday web browsing, Office app usage, etc. I do wish they put a backlight in the keyboard, but not a deal breaker. Have also seen a few reviews online complaining about screen ""wash out"" but we have seen none of that. I'm not sure how many people use their laptops outside.. the brightness is perfect indoors but no clue how it would perform outside (not something we'll ever need). Good purchase, great seller.

  This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.

  The FHD (1920x1080p) version of the Lenovo S330 definitely does NOT have an IPS display. The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients.Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's. It'll work...but why?

  ... you receive a written promise from Lenovo quality control that they'll pay YOU for the time you'll need to spend doing their job for them. I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue.The value proposition for this Chromebook is that you can simply open the box, and get started working, hassle-free.  Value has not been delivered. If I wanted this much aggravation, I'd run one of my old Dell's with Vista.UPDATE: 4/23. Ran powerwash two more times. Spoke with Amazon. Spoke with Lenovo. Ran complete recovery of Chrome OS. Still freezes and crashes. Just ordered a second one for arrival 4/23, and am returning this one. Perhaps this one is just a lemon. If the second machine works as it should, I'll update here. If it doesn't, I'll return it also and post a second review. Total time wasted so far: 12 hours and counting.

  I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. However, it arrived as scheduled in great condition. We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it. Would recommend!

  UPDATE March 23, 2020:It's been a month-and-a-half since my original review (below). I still very much love this laptop. Admittedly, the ""Bad"" list (below) might sound overly negative, but I'm just being real. The laptop isn't perfect, but *for me* the pros still outweigh the cons and I'd still buy this again in an instant. It's totally understandable if some of these things are deal-breakers for other people -- but if you still get the laptop, hopefully this review helps you understand what you're getting.Good:- Still love the large screen and light weight (doesn't feel bulky to me)- Still enjoy the keyboard layout and number pad- So far, no bends or dents. The lid hinge is still tight/stable.- Trackpad works well, feels good.- The screen and resolution are bright and crisp enough for me.Bad (although none of these are deal-breakers for me, some of them are annoying):- The included charger charges SOOOO slowly. The laptop takes hours to charge. Even going from 20% to say 70% takes forever -- it's only a little better if you shut it off/standby/hibernate first. This is my biggest complaint.- The WiFi takes forever to reconnect when resuming Windows from standby or hibernate. This is my second biggest complaint. It seems to happen on different WiFi networks and a none of my other laptops have had this problem on those same WiFi networks. I Googled a lot to try to fix this, but nothing worked -- including latest drivers. This is probably more of a Windows config/driver problem, but it's still happening on my laptop and I can't fix it.- Battery life isn't great. When studying I get maybe 5 hours before draining to 20ish%. Obviously this will be different for everyone because we all run different apps or have different things running in the background, but I'm surprised it isn't better.- Speakers aren't very good. They're not super loud but not very clear either. Pretty disappointing. They sound like they vibrate/resonate when playing particular frequencies. The speakers aren't blown for sure, they just rattle in those very specific instances for some reason.- I've resorted to only using hibernate when I close the laptop lid (versus just going into standby). The laptop doesn't seem to handle standby well and still runs for quite a while before actually going to standby (if at all). Sometimes I put the laptop in a fitted soft case and I later find out that Windows never really went on standby and I now have a dead battery or I find that the laptop is really hot from running while trapped in the case. Hibernate is fine and it's not slow, but it's annoying that standby doesn't work like it does for other laptops. Probably a Windows issue if anything, but I couldn't find any fixes for this -- and I've tried a lot.- I wish the track pad was centered relative to the keyboard's home row and space bar, i.e. a little bit more to the left.- The CPU has throttled down to 0.4 GHz (400 MHz) on occasion. Not a lot though. I wasn't doing anything intensive. Maybe Windows was indexing? Generally, doesn't seem to thermal throttle much though.=====ORIGINAL REVIEW February 4, 2020:I decided I wanted a lightweight, large screen laptop so the LG Gram 17 was really the only option -- other light laptops aren't 17"", and other 17"" laptops aren't lightweight. Because of this I admit that this laptop is on the pricey side, but that's to be expected if there are no direct competitors. I've been waiting for the 10th Gen Intel processor. It runs at a lower clock speed than the previous 8th Gen processor, but according to benchmarks it's faster and has better power efficiency. The 10 nm vs the 8th Gen 14 nm manufacturing helps. I haven't had this long enough yet to comment on everyday use, but I'll tell you my first impressions.Similar to the previous model, it's lightweight with a large screen. The CPU isn't super fast, but that wasn't what was important to me. I wanted long battery life and a large screen. I'm a student so both of these benefit me more than a super-fast processor. The processor is fast enough for what I need it for. A lot of YouTube reviewers don't like this laptop because they think the CPU is under-powered -- they think the only people who want 17"" screens are content creators like them, but they're not understanding the audience that actually appreciate what this laptop has to offer. My previous laptop had a 4k 15"" touchscreen. I'll have to say that I thought I'd use those options more than I really did. I appreciate that this laptop has a lower resolution (but still high enough to be crisp) to help with battery life. Also, I didn't find the touchscreen useful at all so I'm glad this doesn't have it.Some of the things I've read from the previous year's model is that the laptop would consume more power than it could charge when under load (maybe high CPU-intensive tasks? or charging a phone on USB?). So essentially people would say that their battery would drain even while charging, which I think is pretty bad. Hopefully the power-efficiency of the new CPU will help with that, but I don't know if that's still a problem. Also, people said that the CPU would thermal throttle with the 8th Gen Intel. Again, not sure yet if this model will do that, but I'm hoping that the lower clock speed and the better efficiency of the 10th Gen will alleviate that. Also, an LG spokesperson somewhere said that this laptop has ""better cooling"" than the previous gen. I don't know if that's true, but if it is, hopefully that helps as well.Here are my other first impressions. The keyboard keys are quiet but a little mushy. Not the best, but it's good enough. Also, the new keyboard layout with the expanded backspace and enter keys and the four-column number pad seem better than the previous model. When I first typed on the keyboard, I, like a lot of other reviewers, wasn't used to shifting my typing to the left of the screen, but I'm confident that I'll get used to it. I don't use the number pad a lot, but on my desktop I do use it from time to time, so I think the laptop having it isn't a con. Having the proper number pad layout was important to me though because I type by muscle memory and am really fast with the number pad when I need it. The screen is bright enough. I don't like how glossy it is, but this is easily fixable. All my previous laptops had glossy screens and I always covered it up with anti-glare screen protectors. If you can install them correctly, then it's just as good as having an OEM anti-glare screen. People who complain about glossy screens don't usually know that they can correct the issue pretty easily. The trackpad works really well. It's smooth and has a good texture and feels similar to a Macbook Pro which is a good thing. The clickiness of it though is a bit mushy and soft (meaning the travel to push down on the trackpad to click isn't super-deep and it doesn't have a terribly satisfying click to it), but it's adequate and not horrible. I think it's fine. The fingerprint reader worked well, just as good as other laptops I've had. One thing I don't like is that it has Windows 10 Home instead of Pro. Personally I use Bitlocker and would have preferred Pro for this. I may upgrade, but it's an extra cost.Spec-wise, here are some things that I noticed that some people might find useful. The memory is faster than the previous model's. It runs at 3200 MHz instead of 2400 MHz (see screenshot). The CPU base clock speed is slower (1.3 GHz vs 1.8 GHz) and the turbo is slower (3.9 GHz vs 4.6 GHz), but according to benchmarks if the 10th Gen has better processing power, better efficiency, runs cooler, and contributes to longer battery life, then I think this is a win. People would say that the 8th Gen would thermal throttle so getting the max turbo wasn't attainable anyway, so hopefully the new CPU will fix this. One thing I didn't like was that they include two 512 GB M.2 SSDs. Why not just one 1 TB? I saw that another store has the same LG model but with only one 512 GB for $350 cheaper. Looking back on it, I should've bought that and use the difference to upgrade to one 1 TB or 2 TB SSD and sell the 512 GB. I was really hoping they would have at least set up the two SSDs in a RAID 0 configuration so I could have one logical 1 TB drive, but they don't. I included a screenshot of the SSDs that are included (Samsung MZVLB512HAJQ, M.2, 3000 MB/s seq. read, 270K IOPS ran. read, PRIe Gen 3 x4, 1800 MB/s seq. write, 420K IOPS ran. write -- according to Samsung's web site). I also included the TPM information that's listed in the BIOS. Again, because Bitlocker is important to me, I was interested in the TPM. My family's phones and WiFi router all use WiFi 6 (802.11ax) so I'm glad this laptop has it to take advantage of my home network's infrastructure. I can confirm that this laptop also supports the new WPA3 which my router and phones are also using.The things included with the laptop are just the tiny power brick and an Ethernet to USB-C adapter. I love how small and light the power brick is, but I guess we'll have to see if it's under-powered. I've also read that you can charge this laptop using USB-C power delivery. I'm not sure of the wattage it allows, but this is something that I'd like to look into.So all in all, it's too soon for me to really give a long-term review, but I did want to give some information which isn't really shown anywhere else (LG's website, etc.). Yes, the laptop is pricey for what it is, but again, it's the only lightweight laptop that comes in 17"". LG probably won't lower the price until there's more competition in this area, so the high price is expected. Also, this is a niche product. Only certain people want the big screen, the light weight, and moderate processing power. All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase so far. I really do appreciate the better keyboard layout. A non-standard keyboard layout (3-column number pad) is a deal breaker for me, which is why I waited for this version of the laptop rather than getting the previous version.

  Initial impressions of the laptop (weight, battery life, size) are great as written by other reviewers. But after service, driver support and warranty (which no reviewers wrote about) are where the problems are with this laptop. I learnt all this the hard way.Warranty is void on this computer the moment you open the back cover to upgrade your SSD or RAM. This is an up-gradable laptop with an empty SSD slot, and a removable RAM slot.All the Youtube influences talk about how lightweight and configurable the laptop is but they don't tell you that the warranty is void when you open the back cover.Also, if there is a problem with the laptop, you need to send it with the SSD inside to their Michigan repair center, and it will take ten business days for them to ship your laptop back. If you want to remove the SSD (it contains all your information and passwords), before sending a defective laptop, warranty is again void.I learn't all this by speaking with their call center agent. When I asked them why have an empty SSD slot then? The answer was, ""You should upgrade it after the warranty period is over! "".What they are doing is illegal in the United States. This is a violation of Magnuson-Moss Warrany Act. Companies can't void a consumer's warranty or deny warranty coverage solely because the consumer uses a part made by someone else or gets someone not authorized by the company to perform service on the product.There should be a way Amazon forces these companies to clearly state the warranty of their products on Amazon's website for their customers benefit. 1800$ is not chump change.Four Months after Use:1. Update drivers are not present on LG Website.2. Customer wait times are horrible when you call technical support. Email support is non existent. You cannot reply back to the email, technical support will send you. You will be directed to a chatbot, that doesn't even automatically take you to the right division in LG - In this case computers.3. Computer has a Windows App called LG Update Center, where you can update drivers, software etc for the laptop. The issue is, they don't tell you the release date, release notes, or anything about the update on the App.4. When I emailed technical support about this issue (was trying to update the BIOS, and I asked the release date of the bios, as it wasn't present in the LG Update Center App), they directed me to go to Phoenix Bios website and download from there directly the latest drivers. Problem is Phoenix bios makes you install spamware and charges your credit card. Do not install the biosagentplus spamware. You will waste another one day cleaning up the LG computer.I do like the weight of the laptop. But after service doesn't exist. Warranty is useless. Company is good at making Washing Machines and Dryers and they tried to make Cell-Phones, and failed. Now they are trying to make laptops, and don't have a clue of how to go about software updates, customer support and Warranty issues.

  I use my computer to work, listen to music, stream movies.  I'm hard of hearing and often have the volume all the way up.  You can't do that with this one, the voices sound like they are in a tin can.  For as much as this cost ($1700), I would have expected better speakers.  My previous computer, at less than half the cost of this one, had better speakers.Update: I also watch education webinars for work.  Every since video from here, netflix or amazon prime, doesn't line up the video with the audio.  I can go to 2 other computers in the house and have no issue.  A new computer should not work like this.

  Laptop was delivered within a week. Arrived as described. Windows setup has certainly improved. Almost idiot proof. On the other side, I thought I purchased windows operation system without the Win S mode. ( This allows app download only through Microsoft store. Had to figure out how disable Win S mode first thing. ) Great laptop for my use, fast shipping. Overall great experience.

  Unlike other products I've had, the setup was quick and easy. I do miss my back-lit keyboard and wish the markings on the keys were a little more distinct since I'm slightly vision challenged at this point in life, but I'm happy that it's so quick and responsive!

  I bought this laptop for college, being a freshman I was looking for something affordable that would last. I got the core i5 10th gen and I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I had thought about getting a mac but price wise it was out of range. The pavilion is very smooth and crisp in a way. I use it for online class and I have to run some programs for my science classes. It has NOT let me down. I've been using it for about a month now and it still works like new. The setup took me like 15 minutes when I first got it. The only things that I believe could be a con for some is that the battery will not last a whole day. I start class at around 8:20 am and around 12 pm the battery is dead, there is a battery saver button tho and it usually let's my battery last an extra hour or so. Tablet mode is fun, I don't usually use it so I have no comment on that. Regardless, very good product for the price. Would 100% recommend for college students. I don't think this would be a good choice for gaming tho. (sorry for the stickers!)Edit: it has been almost a year since I bought this laptop. It's very sturdy tho it seems light, I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. I take it with me on my backpack (usually besides my tennis racket) again, no dents or scratches. I dropped water on it too a few times, works like new (not saying that it is waterproof, maybe I was lucky) but very strong overall. I've taken a few coding classes that include python, HTML, and CSS and it runs it with no problem. It is very fast, very very fast, personally I keep photos, music, documents and such in an USB which leaves my laptop pretty empty so it could be because of that. Camera is pretty good, gets you through zoom, speakers are good as well. Overall, a year later and I still think this laptop is a 5/5.

  Many things I love about this laptop. Great battery life, it is lightweight it is touchscreen and has tablet mode. I picked it because it had a backlit keyboard in the specs but it does not (but not bugged enough to send it back). I am annoyed at the placement of the power button it is on the side where you grab the laptop to move it and I keep bumping it and turning off the computer. Getting knocked out of Zoom meetings is really annoying. Again I will deal with it but will definitely think about his when I am looking for a new computer.

  HP Pavilion x360 14-inch 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD Storage, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Amazon Alexa Voice Compatible (14-dh2011nr, Natural Silver)Look and FeelWith the exception of the hinges, the laptop shell is entirely made of plastic.  The finish on the top (opposite the screen) is painted to mimic the look of  brushed aluminum.  It looks pretty convincing whilst it's new but I expect that as it gets scratched over the course of its lifetime it will be very obvious even from a distance that it's just painted plastic.The hinge is very nicely designed, moves smoothly and holds sturdily.  There's no wiggle or play, it's just very solid.The whole thing weighs in at 3 lb 9 oz. not counting the power adapter.KeyboardThe keyboard layout is comfortable and doesn't have any unusual key placement or size.  This may not seem noteworthy if you've never used a laptop that did something strange with the keyboard (I'm looking at you Lenovo), but trust me, it matters.Another nice thing about a fairly standardized keyboard layout is the ready availability of keyboard covers.  Although this model is not specifically listed as compatible, this cover fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KKYXXR.  I've had more than one device saved by silicone keyboard covers like this and I strongly recommend them for anyone buying one of these. (I'm not recommending any cover specifically, merely providing an example of one that perfectly fits.  This way you can take the model numbers from that listing and look for others if you like)The keys themselves are well-designed low-profile keys. They're quiet and responsive.  I don't have any problems with bounce and the (mostly) full-width keys are still comfortable under my large hands.The keyboard backlight is very well designed.  Each of the keys including its alternate function (punction etc...) are illuminated cleanly.  There are three backlight levels, though I find the lower intensity unnecessary as the default setting is bright enough to see in a brightly lit room and not overpowering in a dark room.TouchpadThe touchpad is basically standard fare.  It's designed well enough that I didn't find myself accidentally moving the mouse pointer while typing.  Though I still prefer a USB mouse, the touchpad is very serviceable.DisplayThe screen is extremely glossy and will reflect absolute anything remotely bright behind you.  It's not terribly noticeable when you're working with bright/white content on the screen - such as in a word processor or reading most web pages, but when there is darker content on the screen as often happens when watching videos it's surface becomes like a mirror.  That didn't seem like a good design choice to me but maybe having a mirror finish is necessary because it's a touch-screen?The edge-lit IPS does offer a bright and clear image, though it's not as bright as I would like.  Since I don't have a reliable method for measuring nits my evaluation of its brightness is going to be subjective. In summer noontime daylight it's noticeably dimmer than other 300 nit screens I have tested, though it is still somewhat readable if you stay in the shade so I would guestimate it's brightness between 230 and 250 nits.  I would consider this screen as being mostly for indoor use though, as I said, it is marginally usable outdoors on a sunny day provided you have ample shade.  If used in a darker environment the screen is bright but does suffer from typical LCD uniformity problems (see the image of a blank screen attached to this review).The refresh rate of the display seems to be locked at 59Hz.  Being an IPS screen it has very fast switching so it passed the blur-busters tests just fine - motion blur is all but non-existent making it great for watching video.The capacitive touch screen is very responsive and feels accurate even with my giant fingers.  I don't have a stylus to test so I can't comment on compatibility or accuracy of that.Real-Life Windows 10 (Not S Mode!)A lot of this 2-in-1 style of laptop come with an operating system called “Windows 10 Home in S Mode”.  “S Mode” is a highly limited implementation of Windows 10 that only allows you to use the Edge browser and only allows you to run software from the Microsoft App Store.  The inclusion of “S Mode” rather than a real-life Windows 10 is usually an indication that the vendor was not confident that the hardware provided would actually be able to run Windows 10.  Thankfully this laptop comes with a fully enabled implementation of Windows 10 Home and in my testing it performed just fine.Included SoftwareWhat would setting up a new machine be without going through and removing all of the pre-loaded garbage vendors always like to cram in?  This machine comes with a pretty standard complement of bloatware, “free trial” and offer software.  In case those terms don't mean anything to you, it basically referrs to apps that are more about getting you on the hook for paying fees for services than they are about increasing your productivity.Some of the trialware/offerware is built in to Windows 10 itself, some of it comes from HP.  I can't really provide a comprehensive list of what I think you should immediately remove from this laptop upon powering it up, but I will recommend two that you should immediately get rid of.  First is McAfee LiveSafe which is a waste of space that will soak up resources without actually protecting your computer then expire in a year or six months or whenever and beg for more money.  Just uninstall it and reboot – your machine will automatically switch to the built-in Windows Defender anti-malware which is free with Windows, won't kill your battery and actually does a much better job stopping and cleaning malware.  The second thing I recommend you immediately get rid of is “WildTangent Games”.  You'll need to remove both the “App” and the installed program to get rid of it entirely.  I'm deeply disappointed that HP thinks so little of its customers that it would ship this machine with WildTangent Games pre-installed.  During my days as a PC tech WildTangent Games were a universally despised vehicle for spyware.There were quite a few other things I removed right away like Express VPN, Dropbox Offer, Microsoft Office etc... If you don't remove these they will periodically pop up and annoy you by either trying to talk you or scare you into signing up for new services.  If you want cloud-based backup signing up for a Microsoft Account gets you some free “OneDrive” space and if you need more it's worth paying for it – you don't need both Dropbox and OneDrive. The Microsoft Office stuff gives you minimal access to Microsoft Word and tries to get you to sign up for paid services to get the rest.  I switched to OpenOffice years ago and have never looked back.  If you need a VPN service and don't already have one, I suggest you shop around a little rather than just go for Express VPN.  But I digress.  I strongly recommend you go through the installed “Apps” and remove anything that says “Offer” next to it.Convertible / 2-in-1 featuresThe ability to use the “convertible” features was the thing that most attracted me to this machine.  I enjoy watching movies without having to be tethered to any particular room (and when traveling)Laptop ModeIn laptop mode this is just like any other slim-line laptop.  This configuration offers the best/clearest sound as the speakers fire up from the far side of the keyboard, and the best overall ergonomics.Tent ModeIn Tent Mode the laptop is folded into an upside-down V shape and propped up on a surface.  This is by far my favorite mode for watching movies and TV with this machine, but it does come with extra considerations.  In this mode the speakers are pointed away from you, though in my testing I was still able to hear things just fine.  It would have been nice if they had included some silicone or rubber bumpers on the edge to keep the laptop from slipping or to keep rough surfaces from scuffing up the edge of laptop itself.Tablet ModeTablet mode is a bit of a mixed bag.  Essentially you fold the laptop closed backwards with the keyboard and screen on the outside.  The keyboard is disabled in this mode.  While you can use this laptop sort of like you would a tablet, its extra bulk is a definite factor.  The larger difficulty I had, however, was in holding it in a way that did not result in accidentally activating some control or scrolling to the bottom of a page because my fingers tickled the edge of the touch screen.  Switching to ""Tablet Mode"" in Windows 10 did very little to alleviate this.  Also in tablet mode it's difficult to adjust the screen brightness or volume.  I think this mode would be much better if they would provide volume and brightness controls on the edge of the machine and some software adjustment to move controls away from the edges where you're likely to accidently activate them while just trying to hold the ""tablet"" in place.SpeakersMuch is made of the ""Audio by Bang and Olufsen"".  For such small speakers they do sound remarkably clear and present a wider dynamic range than I would expect, but that being said don't expect miracles.  I had to max out the volume in a couple of instances while watching shows in tent mode and even then it did not sound particularly loud.Battery LifeWithout trying to apply any scientific process to judge battery life, I noted while using it that I was able to get about 4-5 hours out of a charge when just browsing the web, watching the occasional YouTube video and writing in a word processor.  It was only about 2.5 to 3 hours while watching Netflix or other videos at full brightness.  At 3470mAh the capacity isn't terribly impressive, but for such a lightweight system it seems just right.WiFi speedThe multi-function Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in one chip provided with this laptop provides thoroughly average performance.  In practice I was able to get transfer speeds of almost 10MB/s (Bytes not bits), which is more than enough for most day-to day activities, but doesn't come close to the performance tuned chips in some of the other laptops I've reviewed, some of which were able to more than double that throughput.  Again, I don't consider this a drawback because it provides perfectly adequate performance for general purpose computing.Webcam / MicrophoneThe built in webcam is very generic with a 720x1280 sensor.  Like most generic webcams, it has a very low ISO sensitivity and therefore requires a decent amount of ambient light to show a clear picture.  In a darker environment the image becomes grainy and video smears as the camera tries to compensate for low light.  I wouldn't try to record for YouTube on it, but it's perfectly serviceable for web conferencing as long as you're in a well-lit room.The built-in microphone on the other hand actually sounds pretty good, picking up voice clean and clear.  The documentation doesn't say for sure, but it's possible the mic was also designed by B&O. In any case I think they did a terrific job for a built-in mic.StorageOne of the things I look for in a laptop is the ability to upgrade the primary storage.  In general if you see ""eMMC"" listed on the description it means that the primary storage (i.e. hard drive) is soldered in and is generally more trouble than it's worth to swap out.  I'm happy to report that this laptop actually has full M.2 NVMe SSD which can, if the need arises, be replaced with a larger capacity drive, though the 512GB drive it ships with is plenty big for my needs. This laptop was clearly not designed to be upgraded or serviced by end users as evidenced by how annoying they made it to take apart, but once I had the back off it looks like it was designed to incorporate a full SATA SSD as well with a spot carved out under the right palm rest and an unpopulated ribbon socket labeled ""HDD1"".  I could not find any documentation on this (as of the time of this review), so I'm not sure if it's an either-or where you have to pick one or the other or if you can use both a SATA and M.2 drive at the same time. I was unable to test this because I don't have the proprietary adapter to connect the drive to the board.The supplied 512GB NVMe drive perfomed adequately but maxed out at ~1GB/s writes and  ~1.5GB/s reads.  This is somewhat normal for a budget drive but about half the potential of the NVMe spec.  As it would have involved re-installing Windows 10, I did not wish to try out a faster NVMe drive to see if the limitation lies with the drive itself or the controller.  Since you're not going to be gaming on this laptop, the drive speeds are absolutely fine.CPU/GPU Performance / ThrottlingSo does this laptop throttle the CPU?  While my default is to assume that it throttles the CPU/GPU until proven otherwise, most of my attempts to verify one way or the other have been stymied by the unavailability of system hooks used by the Intel XTU (which flat out refuses to install) or MSI Afterburner (installs but can't actually see anything). With a base frequency of 1GHz the machine runs pretty cool most of the time.  The fan isn't really capable of moving much heat so I seriously doubt that you will ever see a ""burst"" to 3.6GHz, but again unless you're trying to game on this machine that's largely immaterial.In my testing what games I was able to get running ran reasonably well at medium to high settings - older games ran fine at high settings, newer ones needed to be dialed back.  Even though this isn't a gaming machine it's a good indication of what its capable of.I had no trouble editing large images with GIMP, including computationally complex operations such as perspective shift and de-noise algorithms.The full-sized HDMI port makes it easy to connect a second monitor up to 4k@60 (it will default to 4k@30, but can be switched to 60Hz and in my testing works without any issues).  Likewise it was able to render web pages and video in 4K just as smoothly as it did in 1080p.GamingThis isn't a gaming laptop – which is probably obvious to anyone reading this, but even the most businesslike user may be tempted to dabble now and again.  I had considerable trouble getting games to run reliably on this.  Most titles crashed to desktop after one to five minutes without so much as a helpful error message.  What I did have some luck with were older titles like BioShock, Deus Ex Human Revolution etc...Watching VideoFor video playback I tested a variety of scenarios.  Playback of H265 10-bit 4K (HDMI Outputs 4K) content was basically smooth and flawless as was Blu-ray playback via VLC and libaacs. Both YouTube and Netflix had occasional stuttering on 1080p content but I'm being very nit-picky.  If I was not paying specific attention to how smooth playback was I would probably not have noticed.Miscellaneous- Unfortunately the 14-dh2011nr doesn't support Power Delivery which means that it can't be charged via the USB-C port like some of the higher-end x360's can.  In my opinion this is a huge missed opportunity as the ability to charge via USB-C makes it easier to purchase extra power adapters (one for home one for the office, etc...) and opens up the possibility of extending runtime while traveling by using a large power bank that supports PD.- Had to use compatibility mode to get certain apps (OpenOffice) to properly scale fonts etc... This is generally caused by the display drivers not being full featured enough to support the DPI mode being set from the app.- Like most laptop power adapters, there is no obvious way to wrap the cord to minimize the space it takes up inside your bag.- The USB ports had no trouble delivering enough power to power external spinning hard drives and optical drives without needing to use a second power source. This also means that if you use this laptop's ports to charge other devices over USB they may charge faster if the device is designed to take advantage of higher-amperage power sources.Conclusion:The 14-dh2011nr isn't the most powerful, doesn't have the brightest screen, isn't the fastest, but it has all around great features and performance for this price range.  It's perfect for surfing the web, web conferencing, editing photos, and watching movies or shows.  It's one of the best priced 2-in-1 laptops I've seen that's capable of running full-blown Windows 10 Home and doesn't feel sluggish in the slightest.  It's quiet, has good battery life, lightweight and an all around pleasure to use.  In short it's exactly what I was looking for.Pros:- Lightweight and thin- Full-sized standard keyboard (compatible with available keyboard covers)- Full-sized HDMI socket - supports 4K@60 just fine- Full Windows 10 Home (NOT ""S Mode"")- Good battery life- Convertable has great options for watching video or working without a keyboard- Quiet fan - even going full blast it's barely above a whisper- Decent amount of storage - 512GB- Legit M.2 drive (so it's upgradeable)- Great built-in mic- The full-sized USB 3.0 ports deliver enough amperage to support power-hungry devices like external hard drives and external DVD/Blu-ray drivesCons:- Shiny reflective screen surface can be really distracting  (mostly during dark scenes in videos)- No ""bumpers"" or rubber feet to protect the edge and stop slipping in Tent Mode- Screen is only around ~240 nits makes it only marginally usable in daylight - this is really an indoor screen- Pre-loaded with bloatware/nagware software including the spyware ""WildTangent Games""Neutral Observations:- Can't really game on it (newer titles seem to run okay but almost all of them crash out in the first minute)- Tablet mode is novel but difficult to use because controls are on the edge where you're holding your fingers- The GPU is extremely basic and lacks any options for monitoring- The CPU lacks the normal system hooks for monitoring

  After two weeks of use, I like the feel and action of the keyboard and that it is lighted. Everyday light computing will not tax this machine but I am not sure how it would be for gaming or intensive graphic manipulation. Battery life is less than 3-4 hours of light computing. I'm not sure I'll keep this machine, mostly because of the battery life and feeling unsure of whether it truly has DDR 4 ram.

  The first one I received quickly locked up and prevented downloading items from Microsoft store or even windows updates.  No matter what I tried, it would not work right.  During discussions with Amazon to return item, It was recommended that I try another one.  I did and that one has worked really, really well.  The start up time is pronominal, everything seems to work very well except for the battery life.  It goes quickly.  However, I am so happy with the rest of the laptop that I have chosen to ignore the number of times I have to hook up to charge.  Overall, it's a very good laptop which I did not think I would say based on the first one I got.  I gave it four stars because of all the problems with the first laptop.

  I love that it is lightweight and smaller. It's not tablet size, but its not bulky like other laptops. I bought it for my home based business and it works great. The down side is that when you first start it up and set it up it is set as Windows 10 S and you are unable to install apps that are not Microsoft approved like Chrome, Firefox, Facebook Messenger, and Adobe Acrobat. However, you can find similar apps on the Microsoft store. If you would rather have Win 10 then you can switch to it from either the Microsoft store or your settings. You will lose some of the Windows 10 S features like the extra security protection. Another reason I gave 4 stars on storage capacity is that there is only 5 gigs of one drive space. You can either upgrade or if you have a family or business version of Microsoft Office 365 then you'll have the full 1TB of one drive space. I plan to upgrade the hard drive in the future to a 1TB.Overall, it is a great buy and perfect for what I need it for. I chose to keep the Win 10 S as the operating system. And I just transferred my files to my one drive account I have associated with Microsoft Family so I have all my files. I just delete what I don't need from my main account after it has been uploaded to my secondary account. Just a word of warning you are not able to link Microsoft accounts to each other so make sure when you set up your laptop that you choose the account you want to login with because once it is set it cannot be changed.

  Update - The seller came through and now I have the correct AC adapter. As I stated earlier once I switched to the standard Windows 10 Home, everything is working great and much faster than my old laptop.I had to switch to windows 10 home, that was simple so I could install quickbooks. It runs fast, but it came with the wrong ac adapter, I had to use my old one, I hope amazon or the seller sees this and sends me the right one.

  Laptop was good but incredibly basic and too much money for its limited capability, also too small for my interest, so I returned it. The seller made me pay a $100 restocking fee!!! I've never seen something like that before and its ridiculous. It was deducted from my refund. Definitely don't buy unless you're sure. Its a good laptop you get what you ask for but the seller is unreasonable in the refund aspect. And It took 10 days after they received the item for me to even get my heavily deducted refund.

  On the advise of my son I upped the features of my new laptop. My last laptop was 6 years old and cost $250. I got my monies worth. This new computer is lighter, faster and works as soon as I turn it on. I guess I kept my old computer too long when I think that is one of it's best features! This keyboard does not have the number keypad on the right hand side so I will have to get used to that. I used a flash drive to move all of my files and pictures over. So far, I would say it is a great purchase.

  I’m always hesitant with purchasing electronics on any marketplace (I.e Amazon ) but everything is perfect and exactly what I’ve been looking for. It’s worth the money you’ll spend on it for sure! If you’re anything like me I know you have to scroll through a few more reviews to be convinced but trust me when I tell you if ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING was wrong from the time I purchased to the time I received my laptop I would say it. It also came super quick.

  I use this for personal and business computing at home - currently independent contractor.  Screen size is good - can use stand-alone (when I travel) but add larger screen at home for second screen.  Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.  I am not a Google fan so the Microsoft suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) work fine for me - although Edge I am not crazy about.  Google and other aps work fine.I only gave 4 stars as every new computer set up is a pain.  Dell has been a reliable partner of mine for years.

  As expected. It is fantastic! Light weight and well made. It performs smooth and quietly. We just needed a laptop for day to day office work and we had a small budget. The price was unbelievable and the performance has my two tombs up. The delivery was made way ahead of time, the package was well wrapped and padded. Wow! Thank you.

  I am very happy with the laptop. Since all of the wireless mouse, that I have gotten, were not a success, it was great to find that, all I need use is a finger. Plus, it does have USB 2.0 (socket) that allows me to my corded mouse, and my printer.

  The Dell model 3583 is specified (Dell Specs p.12) with an 8th generation Intel core i3, i5, or i7 CPU. I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD.  That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream! In addition - 3583 comes spec'd with Win 10 Home (not S mode). S mode sucks and the time it takes to dump it is a pain. 2cts.

  Do not waste your money or your time and energy. Please! I felt like everyone else who gave this a chance. I was nervous buying a refurbished computer, but this site had pretty good reviews overall. I was definitely wrong. The laptop shipped quick, but as soon as I pulled it out of the box- it wouldn’t turn on. I tried everything, eventually the following day I brought it to the Apple store to just make sure it wasn’t something as easy as the charger not working. NOPE! That’s when they were able to tell me the laptop had this weird covering on the bottom of it- which covered all the computers info. Turns out, it came from a school. They said it was definitely sketchy and had a hardware issue. I sent it back- it’s taken almost 2 weeks since I sent it out to get my refund- they issued it today, but it still says it would take 3-5 days to get in my account. What a freaking headache and waste!!

  I was expecting a computer with scratches and obvious wear, but there were only two scuffs on the side of the computer which are barely noticeable and well-hidden with a plastic hard-case protector. The computer is rather small and light-weight. Think: iPad Pro with an attached keyboard.The battery life is pretty good for this kind of computer, but that’s just coming from a college student who only uses it to write essays and browse the internet; I don’t use it for more professional tasks like video-editing . Someone previously said the screen is yellowish but that wasn’t the case for me. All in all, it’s a really good, functional computer for the price. I’ll change my review if I encounter problems.

  I was nervous about buying a refurbished Mac after reading so many negative reviews, but I'm glad I did!  This is a great computer, updated with the latest OS and from early 2015.  For me, this is great for what I need it for.  I purchased the additional warranty just incase.  So far, I'm happy with my purchase!  My best advice is to read the seller's feedback page before buying.

  I ordered this Mac Book Air, and reading from the description, I was thinking it would be wonderful. It was a good price, and I'm very familiar with Mac Books. I ordered this sometime in July, and it has worked perfectly. I decorated the outside with some of my favorite stickers, and I had all my information on there. It was my favorite thing I bought.""Oh, well why did you give it one star?"" you're probably wondering. Well friend, you see, this product came without 2 essential parts on the backside of the keyboard. When December came, my keyboard stopped responding to the computer completely. I called Apple about the issue, and what they told me over phone did not work. I had to visit Apple in person, so they could look at it. I was there for hours, and nothing got solved. So I then visited a Professional Computer-Repairman, and when he took apart the backside of the keyboard, he saw nothing wrong, until he looked deeper. He found that I was missing 2 essential parts to my laptop. He tried ordering these parts from China, but they have not responded.I have tried contacting Amazon many times, and they're not willing to help me out since my computer was purchased months ago, so it passed the 90 day rule. I feel as though this special situation should grant me a refund. But nope. Next time I order a laptop I will go to a Repair shop, have them take it apart, and see if anything is wrong. If there is, at least I can send it back within 90 days :).Ohhhh wait, I can't order a new laptop! I'm a poor college student and only had enough money for a laptop when I originally bought this one. And it was a complete dud! Can't wait to spend the rest of my college days in a computer lab. I don't think I'll ever buy from Amazon again. I'm sorry.

  After conducting research, I chose this laptop for my business purposes: both running day to day online operations, but more importantly powerful enough to use in 3D modeling for new development of physical products and additive manufacturing.The machine arrived quickly, but I should have expected something to be wrong when I noted there was no packaging material in the shipping box.  I opened the interior package containing the laptop and the factory packaging appeared undamaged as well as reasonably robust.Then I began the process of starting up my new device.  In the middle of the screen the system was clearly having problems.  Note the attached pictures.  I went went to the manufacturer's website and made sure the latest drivers were downloaded and installed.  I conducted the manufacturers online tests and this did not remedy the issue.  Sadly I would have to return/replace this.Here is where it becomes absurd.  I drove to the Amazon store at Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree, Colorado.  I wanted to expedite the return process, and I conceived of Amazon being interested in getting a replacement to me quickly.  I offered to come back to this location the next day if they could replace it quickly.  They would not be able to replace it quickly. Not only was this not possible (and I may have been too hopeful for this outcome) the Amazon store would NOT accept the return at the location.  Instead I was required to drive to a UPS store to make the return.Along with this laptop I ordered a laptop fan to aid in keeping the device cool and performing well.  Since I was not keeping the laptop I returned this item right there at the Amazon store.  However, I was not allowed to turn return this broken laptop costing over $2000 in the same location.  This makes NO SENSE.  Why would a company that sold a product require the customer to use more third parties rather than its own agent/location in order to return it?  The customer service person on-site had no explanation.I drove another 9 miles across town to the nearest UPS store.  Just before it closed.  I re-initiated the return process via my smart phone.  Instead of being providing a scan code to provide to UPS... I was required to email myself, and the UPS store a copy of the shipping label, then pay the UPS store additional money to print Amazon's return label.The process was absurd.I was really looking forward to using this device as the online reviews (not necessarily Amazon's) led me to believe this was a great computer.  I do not know if the damaged screen was caused by shipment or a factory flaw.I do know that Amazon made this process difficult.  I will now be waiting for ""7 days"" to get my refund issued, so that I can find a replacement and it will not be from Amazon.I will not be taking the risk of buying high-end electronics through Amazon again.  At this point it may be better to buy directly from the manufacturer or a local store.UPDATE:  Between Amazon's absurd return requirements, and UPS incompetence, my time and money were totally wasted.  After two weeks of waiting, worrying, tracking and nonsense, I still do not have my money back for a defective product.  DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.  They are the 21st Century version of ""The telephone company"".  Too big to care.

  I have always wanted an Alienware and was happy to choose this one. When it works, it works very well. It's also beautiful to look at.The problem is my PC crashes all the time - generally daily. I get the dumbest errors like Hard Drive - Not Installed. Dell support is useless. They try to funnel you to automated systems rather than humans and leave you wasting your time until you get frustrated and give up. It's almost like they're trying to frustrate you long enough with crappy tech support that your warranty expires before you recover your mental health.

  I gave 4 stars Cus its wrong description. As same as the first man who reviewed this item. the description didn’t match the description in terms of graphics, only a 2070 rather than a super! (Originally it showed 2070 super, now it changed) the laptop is good, but can be better. It can run most 3A game smoothly. The temperature of CPU runs as 76 degree centigrade, but it will not decrease frame rate. Cannot feel pretty hot on the keyboard. The other thing I have to mention that I paid $24XX for the laptop. However, it has $230 off discount now. Ready to return it in a few days! Already buy another one from Alienware website, which is 2080s. Generally, I like this laptop, and it can be better!

  First the big big pro is the weight is way lighter than the old 15r2 way less that is great, the only con on this is that there is no metal frame anywhere.So far I have noticed the temperature and fans action when installing some games and primarily with the battery charger plugged in. I have not yet evaluated the battery usage, I will prefer the dark one but this was with almost 400 usd discount so I took it. This does have the 2070 super inside as advertised. I will review some more in a couple of months. But alienware is my preferred gaming brand of laptops.Also this does not have SB audio card nether the Klipsch speakers it is a sad thing but how can you light weight ?

  What else can I say?  I did nothing more than run the suggested Windows/Dell updates and play World of Warcraft.  The machine ran the game very well, though it did run a bit hot as other mentioned.  I experienced the occasional screen-tearing, and some weird hangs where whatever applications were running would stutter for about a second.  This is already behavior I had not experienced in another laptop, but I mostly ignored it.Then the machine bricked.  Just shut down without warning and would not turn back on... sad.

  Fantastic product, handles everything you can throw at it with ease. Beautiful screen, keyboard is nice and responsive as well. Only concern is the heating. To play some high end games at max graphics quality it is imperative to have it on the full speed settings for fan. CPU temps even with this sometimes high north of 100 celcius. Recommend buying a cooling pad for extended gaming sessions. Otherwise, 10/10

  This is the slowest computer I have ever messed with. I literally recieved this 40 minutes ago and have gotten so many unresponsive pages and had to force close them. I thought it was my internet even though it is running as usual. I was able to do everything I needed on my other laptop before this one even loaded the page I needed to be on.

  The Lenovo Ideapad 3 14 laptop is a very solid laptop and a must-buy for just $450.To start off with the pros,This laptop is very light, portable, fast, and powerful. I'm a college student going into I.T. and I edit videos a lot. The RAM, GPU, and CPU can easily handle that type of workload for 1080p video. The Ryzen 5 3500U with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics is more than capable of handling light gaming, 1080p editing, Unity/Unreal/Blender rendering, and absolutely blazes through everyday tasks.The keyboard has a phenomenal feel to it. While it's definitely no Thinkpad keyboard, it feels much better than most laptop keyboards out there. The membranes give a nice, tactile, solid feel to each large key, providing a comfortable, solid, satisfying typing experience.The 256GB NVMe SSD gives the laptop a very snappy speed, with a near-instant boot time. While the storage capacity is definitely not vast, it makes up for it in speed. The Ideapad 3 also includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, so an external SSD/HDD is definitely a viable option if you want more storage on the laptop. (it's what I did.)The 1080p display is crisp, sharp , and beautiful (if you spend some time color adjusting the screen in the Radeon settings.) It's definitely more than viable for watching movies, streaming TV shows, or editing videos in 1080p.Now for the cons,The Ideapad 3's battery is definitely not a poor one, but it's far from great. On max performance mode, I rarely get more than 2 hours of battery life out of this computer on full brightness. However, running this on the ""better battery"" mode barely sacrifices any performance for me, and I've been able to get a significant 4-6 hours of battery life when running that mode.The trackpad is a very smooth experience, yet moving your finger around on it produces a weird knocking sound occasionally, but I've found this to quiet down as the laptop is used more often. Minor gripe.I know a lot of people have complained about the screen on this computer, but honestly, it's far from a bad display. Sure, it only goes up to 220 nits (from my testing) so it can't realistically be used outside on a sunny day, but for indoor use, even in a bright room, the display is easy to look at and is bright enough to be very clear. Now, keep in mind, the screen comes with all the downfalls of a TN panel, with viewing angles being rather lackluster, but while looking straight at the computer, there's few displays you can get that beats this one for a sub $500 laptop paired with this powerful hardware.In conclusion,If you're looking for a good laptop for under $500 that doesn't look or feel cheap despite the (very solid in my opinion) plastic construction, this Lenovo is an absolute no-brainer. The Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 provides performance akin to laptops over double this one's price. If portability, power, and convenience are what you're keeping an eye out for, I can easily highly recommend this computer.Qualifications:- Information Technology Major-Computer Repairman for 4 years (both desktop and laptop)-PC system builder-Overall Computer EnthusiastThanks for reading my review!

  I normally don't do reviews but, if you're like me you also scoured the internet and found nothing on this laptop based on the model number provide or the pictures. There's conflicting information from the representative and the photos/specs provided so this is the specs as it sits in my hands.Specs:All plastic shellIdeaPad 3 14ADA05 81W0003QUSRyzen 5 3500u3 USB-A ports, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, there is no USB-C on this device. Do not use the answer from the representative as correct on this one. I even asked a more clarifying question and was told there is a USB-C, but you cannot charge over it.The screen is a 1920x1080 TN panel, no touch screen256GB NVME drive - no spinning HDD, so disregard the section that says 7200rpm on the description page8gb of DDR4 ram at 2400mhz3 cell battery - seems okay power saving options gives it roughly 8hrs depending on what you're doing and your tolerable screen brightness (but your mileage may vary)There is no back lit keyboard. The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it.Review:This appears to be Lenovo's answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU.Compared to my wife's Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that's not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the ""New"" model and $699 for a used model.Conclusion:If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you're getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait.If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point. Even if they come at a higher price point it will drive the price of the 3500u down.

  Note, there are 3 components of this REVISED review. The 1st regarding the product, the 2nd regarding the vendor. And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty.-----TL,DR: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. With a very low effort refurb process there appears to be a higher than average number of purchased units quickly failing, and the vendor fails to honor the warranty by providing false or misleading correspondence to warranty inquiries.-----1.) I admit I wasn't expecting much as far as the Chromebook itself. I was specifically looking for a decent, stable, used/refurb older Chromebook, modestly priced unit to use for testing, debugging, and experimentation in an educational environment. It is not my primary machine, so I didn't need it to be super snappy. This model is particularity geared towards the school/student market, so I figured it would be reliably sturdy. I was pleased to find that this unit was extremely clean, well functioning, and very speedy and responsive even beyond my basic needs. The only drawback of using an older refurb unit is battery performance. This one doesn't last very long, or hold a charge well. But I'm pretty proficient with this tech, and already knew that this battery design is only optimally rated for an approximate 18 month window, after which a steady decline in battery performance should be expected. It's just part of the territory. Replacing these batteries is not very complicated. Anyone considering a refurbished model that has more than a couple of years under it should consider doing the same. This unit (true to the model line in general) has sturdy, solid feel, a responsive and snappy keyboard, a clear bright screen, and nice audio.2.) As far as the vendor, I initially could not have been more satisfied. Not only was the price lower than I expected to have to pay for a modest refurb unit, but shipping was almost immediate, and FAST! I expected a 2-day shipment via Amazon Prime, but my delivery arrived less than 23 hours after placing the order. I don't live in an area where faster than 2-day service is typically an option, so this was an especially great surprise.--------HOWEVER.......3.) After less than two months of very sparse and careful use (a combined use of under 3 hours) the unit simply died, no longer booting up.After ensuring the battery was fully charged I applied the 3-key reset method (esc-refresh-pwr) and the screen flickered the ""Chrome OS is missing...."" message before pixelating into random lines and colors, quickly seizing up. Repeated attempts produced the same results.Being proficient with this tech (I am a Chromebook administrator on a school site) it was quickly evident the unit was suffering logic board failure. Presuming that any tech support will still want to go through all the paces, I still proceeded with an attempt to freshly install Chrome OS, but it continued to freeze, flicker and pixelate upon any attempt to boot up. A call into Amazon's tech support to isolate symptoms confirmed my diagnosis of logic board failure. This is despite having very light use of this unit for less than a total of 3 hours since purchase. I was not worried as the unit has died well within the vendor's 90-day warranty, and after having been so thoroughly surprised by their very speedy purchase fulfillment, I fully expected them to honor that warranty. However the several communications I have had with this vendor have produced confusing responses with no indication thus far that they will honor the warranty and replace the unit or refund the purchase.I initially notified the vendor regarding the failure of the unit, and hoped to elicit information about their warranty coverage. I also attached the transcript of the chat with Amazon's tech support identifying logic board failure. Their response was the following:""Your message has been assigned to me, and I am reviewing it as a high priority. I will follow up with you very soon. Blazing Prices is committed to your satisfaction, and I will make every effort to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. Thanks for choosing Blazing Prices!""Have a great day!Thank you,Blazing Prizes""That is all good and well, but I took note that their response did not include an actual service representative's name to correspond with the noted ""me"" in their response. An actual contact person is usually identified in context of following a ticket through a tech support chain. This was an early indicator of a pat automated response.Two days later I received a followup email that appeared similarly automated, but with the additional note that I should contact the manufacturer for warranty assistance, stating that the manufacturer has been notified of my query and that they stand ready to assist me.Now, at this point I knew that the response was laughably suspect. Not only did they not provide any identifying contact information about whom (or how) to contact ""the manufacturer"", but I knew for a fact that this manufacturer (Dell in this case) was absolutely not poised to offer warranty assistance for a 3+ year old 2nd-hand low-end Chromebook. In short, Blazing Prices outright lied.I responded to their email about ""the manufacturer"" to see what they would say if I I asked for more information about following up with the manufacturer. I received the above-mentioned automated reply.I knew by then that I would get nowhere with the vendor. Still, I have continued to follow up with additional queries in the weeks following. As I post this I still have a few days left within the 90-day warranty period. But each response from the vendor has likewise mirrored the previously noted automated response.They are not necessarily a scammer. They sold me a product at what on the surface should have been a very competitive price. If it continued to function at least beyond the warranty period the vendor would have met their obligation decently. However it is clear by my experience, as well as those of other reviewers, that this vendor has falsified some of the claims on the product page. They certainly are not able to account for the integrity of the product  - and in such cases that is what gives a supposed 90-day warranty its value - but this vendor also has shown no indication that they will honor that warranty - so having added it to the product listing constitutes fraud.I already have a tech support ticket in to Amazon regarding this purchase, and am following up with them regarding Blazing Prices fraudulence in skirting their warranty obligation.Do not purchase from this vendor.

  At first I was very pleased with the computer, but after one month it started flickering on the screen. I contacted the seller who responded quickly. After a few informational email exchanges, I have not heard back from him about resolving the issue. I was leery about purchasing a refurbished computer and now wish I had not.

  These Dell Chrome Books are really nice! We got them for our boys ages 13 and 11 for Christmas. They use them for homework and playing games! It’s one game that they really play that they can’t play on this chrome book because it doesn’t have windows. Rowblocks is the name of the game I think! Lol.... about two months after getting the books we noticed that they wouldn’t charge and they could only use them if they were plugged in. We contacted the company and sent them back and two weeks later they sent them out knew books. These are working great! Turns out the both of the books had bad battery packs. Customer service was great and I would definitely buy from them again!

  I thought that when you got refurbished that it worked. I had to replace the battery, the only way you could use this is if it was plugged in. It was also very scratched. Not someplace I would use again.

   This detachable magnetic keyboard two-in-one tablet computer is adorable in that it is so much smaller than any other laptop that I’ve owned. This Haobook106 has Micro USB port, USB3.0 port, HDMI port, DC jack, earphone jack, mic and TF card slot. It has a super thin 1280x800 IPS 10 inch high-definition touch screen display that works so effortlessly! Some of the specs are it has a 2GB RAM, 32GB of storage when support of TF card slot which can expand the storage up to 512GB! It has a very decent Camera 0.3MP+2.0MP (front and back camera). The battery is 6000mah and lasts me for days because it works so well.  The Operating system is Windows 10 which works like a charm on this device.My favorite aspect of this product is the detachable magnetic screen. It comes off so easily and quickly becomes a tablet for convenience of doing many things, but then it can fold up and be put away with added protection unlike most tablets that are exposed.I have a lot of future use in this product and look forward to experiencing it’s full potential. I would highly recommend this for a college student or for someone who likes and appreciates the multifunctional tablet to laptop capabilities. You must stay aware so that you do not pick it up by the screen because or disconnects so easily, which is a huge part of what I love about it. Just be aware.

  I ordered 2 of these tablet/laptops for my kids for Christmas. I was looking for a Windows based machine as the Google Chromebooks can't do some of the online games that they like. So, I researched and this one came up with pretty good reviews. It was a nightmare! First, just getting it set up was a pain but we got through all that and got the kids going. However, even though they weren't doing anything with major graphics or anything, the machines were SUPER slow. I have good internet and use multiple devices on it without this issue, so it isn't that. It was only slow on these machines. Additionally, it was so slow that many things wouldn't load or function at all. Really, just didn't have the capacity to do much of anything. I asked the kids and so now the laptops are on their way back in (For a $43 restocking fee per laptop btw). Cost me $86 for useless machines. Will never do again!

  We purchased this as an extra tablet to use with our label printer for our ecommerce business.  The sole use of this computer was to use the internet to generate shipping labels and then print the labels.  It stopped connecting to the internet after about 6 weeks and stopped connecting to the label printer (via USB) after about 7 weeks.  Extremely slow.  Honestly very painful to use especially considering we were only using it for one purpose.

  It stopped working and it over heats. The ROM and RAM is too low, and it frequently hangs. It’s keyboard is so small and gets jammed after 10 days or using it. I would rather go buy an acer or chrome book which costs the same price, rather than buying this China useless product

  Don’t buy it!  If you do, be very careful when opening it in “laptop” mode.  The tablet/top portion has 2 flimsy plastic tabs and one of them broke the 3rd time we used it.  Because one of the tabs broke, the top portion will not connect to the bottom/keyboard portion.  As such, it is useless.

   The days of paying $400 to $500 for even a entry level laptop is definitely gone. With these brands that are coming out, not only you can afford an entry level laptop for less than $300, they perform as good as some of the $500 laptops out there.This is one of the reasons why I bought a second laptop as our children are homeschooled and the technology seems to accelerate faster and the devices get outdated quickly. This laptop is very fast for its price range and it can do just more than light gaming as well as daily surfing and work-related tasks. The screen is nice and bright and can play HD videos and was able to play Roblox which seems to be very popular with kids nowadays without it lagging.The Wi-Fi also has the standard 5 gigahertz and 2.4 GHz antenna as well as Bluetooth connection so most modern devices will connect to this laptop perfectly fine. The surface area for the the touchpad is also large outside of using a mouse but it's nice and lightweight, it's thin, and for the price you can't beat it 😃👍

  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it!

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install. Everything is working as intended. I would recommend This Laptop. I like the auto on feature and the 4 digit pin login, makes it easy to get to work.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

  Revised: 05/29/21Laptop completely froze - non responsive keys, mouse, even Ctrl-Alt-Del non functional.Had to turn off and back on. All my windows were recovered at least, but this is concerning. Also noticed some periodic screen flickering.  I have not yet used this for any gaming or heavy duty processing - just emails and web surfing so far. About 30 hours usage since new.---Note there are 2 models - one with touchscreen, one without. The Galaxy Book Pro does not have a touchscreen. I currently have a laptop with a touchscreen and found I used this feature very rarely. It always seemed awkward on a laptop sized screen. I use my tablet when I want/need to use this capability. I've only had this Galaxy Book Pro a couple days, but so far am pleased with it. Amazing how light it is. And so far my downloads, internet work, and Office applications are performing better than any previous computer I've had (and I've had a lot.)  Screen is clear and bright. Sound is good. For my go to, everyday computing needs, I rate this 5 stars. I may even purchase one for my 90+ year old  Dad who spends much of his day web surfing. :)

  I did a lot of research before buying this laptop and I am extremely satisfied with it.  The only difficulty was with MS Windows needing to do a lot of updates before things stabilized but that is true for ANY new Windows PC.  Some of the online reviews had negative comments but I found them not to be a problem.  Here's some examples:  Some said the display was too dim but I felt that it was plenty bright in daylight or in a dim room.  Yes, there is some flexing in the keyboard but for normal typing it was not even noticeable.  The speakers, though not fantastic, I found to be better than I expected.  Granted that my previous HP laptop had up firing speakers which sounded better and the Samsung speakers are under the laptop body firing down but they sounded pretty good.  Based on the negative speaker reviews for the Samsung I was expecting the sound to be terrible but it was actually pretty good.  Another reviewer had problems with the Wi Fi speed he was getting but I ran a speed test and got the full speed I always get from my Wi Fi.The overall performance and graphics is very good and the light weight and size are excellent.  I had to wait a little longer to get the Mystic Silver but I really didn't want the blue one.  The wait was worth it!!

  The screen is amazing. Laptop.is extremely thin. Lightweight. Only con, is the the mousepad ""click"" is horribly loud and feels extremely cheap. Beautiful laptop. Very satisfied. Charges with USB type C 65w charger. Had a issue with the $100 gift card you're supposed to get but Amazon realized quickly.

  (5.20.2021)I feel I may need to update this review, for the 15.6"" Galaxy Pro i7, later at some point because currently I am not impressed.The display is nice, the laptop is lightweight and its performance seems to be quick - boot time is satisfyingly quick.It is the overall build quality that I am unimpressed with; the bottom of the laptop bows out a small bit.  Laptop body feels like cheap plastic - if you're purchasing this, get a protective sleeve for it.Samsung will be releasing a clear case for this at some point, but it currently is not available for purchasing.If you are not careful with how you pick up the laptop, the body can flex just enough to click the trackpad as if it were a mouse click.Only reason I may change my review is depending on the quality of productivity-levels I can get to with this as well as using a Samsung Galaxy S7+ to operate as the second monitor for the laptop.

  Coming from a Pixelbook, even after just 1 day of using the Pixelbook Go, I am finding that I prefer so many things about it, particularly the excellent keyboard, speakers, and battery life. The trackpad is also very good. The screen seems very good to me with plenty of brightness and good resolution for internet browsing, documents, photos, spreadsheets, and the like. I like that the Go is a bit smaller and lighter than the Pixelbook. It feels very solid to me, more so than the Pixelbook. It's a keeper for me. I have the cheapest version with the M3 processor and it seems perfectly fine for general use. I haven't run into any slowdowns yet, but I also don't do any gaming or video editing, just general internet use.

  Let’s be honest, a laptop is a laptop, at the end of the day not much to them except screen, looks and how it all is put together.  I have a windows pc for gaming, but when I want an easy to use all arounder I love using chromebooks.  I have a pixel slate but wanted a regular laptop for school work to take with me anywhere I am going to go.  Rather than go over another typical laptop review I mean there is really nothing I can add except tell you why I choose it over the competition.What I want in a laptop:  looks, good battery life, good keyboard, nice display, thin/light, reliable, good price and decent performance.The go versus:Asus 425/433/434:  these are probably the biggest competition in price, looks and performance,  The issue with the 434 is the lack of reliability with numerous reports for users. At 3.2 lbs it is kinda heavy, and the 433 has a cheap keyboard deckHp/Dell 14 inch:  I put these both together because they are similar and they both are very heavy approaching closer to 4 lbs.  To give you an idea my 15.6 gaming laptop weighs 4.8 lbs. The dell is not very attractive to me and more bland.  The HP is attractive but still heavy, not a bad choice, but not the best option IMO.Acer Spin 13:  very premium,  but more of an industrial design, also heavy, great performance though.  UHD display.Pixelbook:  probably the best alternative, and checks a lot of boxes but I find the large bezels very dated. Still expensive if you want to buy it new.Samsung plus V2:  another good alternative with a metal lid.  Under 3 lbs and not bad looking.  The bottom portion is plastic and it does feel like it.  Plain 1080p panel.The pixelbook go has a good 1080p panel which you don’t find often in chromebooks unfortunately.  Outside of the pixelbook the go is the only other one under 2.5 lbs.  It is also thin.  Slim side bezels.  Great speakers and keyboard.  The go checks all my boxes for a laptop perfect for this my masters program.When I first heard the go announced I was upset in the pricing, but then I compared it to the competition.  At regular price almost all the competition sells at $599.  The base pixelbook go that I bought is $649.  The go is $50 dollars more but compared to the rivals it has a leg up on build quality and looks with many of them.  Now most of the other laptops I mention they have been on sale for significantly lower than msrp so you might want to consider that.  There also is no fold-able display like many of the others, which for me has less meaning for the way I use the device.What google did was refine the basic laptop and wrapped it in a pretty bow, which is the same thing that surface laptop, macbook air have done.

  Brilliant laptop! The build quality is top notch and everything from the keyboard and track pad to the full HD screen is a very pleasant and premium experience.  I got the base model and I think for most people that's all you need unless you need more storage. Chrome OS is lightweight already, so the laptop has absolutely zero performance issues with it's configuration.  The battery is stellar, I'm getting nearly 12 hours before having to charge, and it has fast-charging capabilities when you do have to.  The only limitations are Chrome OS, which isn't a problem for me since I'm only using things like google docs and sheets for school. If you need programs for heavy photo or video editing or if you're planning to play anything more intense than an android game than this laptop isn't for you. But if you need a beautiful, fast and simple OS that allows you to answer emails, write a few documents and watch some Netflix with ease than look no further than this machine.

  I really wanted to love this unit but it's got a screen flicker bug and support is refusing to provide a timeline for updates.  As with most things google, if it works great, if you have trouble expect to get lost in a maze of different departments all of whom have no real answers.  You get the software when they deliver it and if there is a problem you wait months for them to resolve it.For those that might be using this as an alternative to linux.  There is still a lot of things you can't do.  You can't attach USB devices to the linux container ( unless it's android ) so things like Ethernet or other devices are right out.  You can't have inbound port access without 3rd party chrome apps which do port redirection ( and clobber the originating IP ), while they claim GPU support it's pretty lackluster at this point.  They are making movements to removing hyper-threading totally from the software which would be a 30-40% negative impact on performance compared to similar outfitted notebooks.EDIT:After nearly a month they appear to have corrected one of the flickering issues, the most annoying one at least.  Raising review two 3 stars for the time being.

  Want to sort some data in Excel? No.Want to open two Word documents at the same time? Nope.Want to right click on a misspelled word? JK. LOL. Nope.Want to save a file and then attach it to an email? Not today my man! (Note: There is a weird workaround where you can save things into the Download folder on the hard-drive and then attach from there. Otherwise it's useless.)I cannot begin to image what makes this an expensive computer. It is alarmingly difficult to perform the most basic functions. I'm a graduate school student and bought it for online classes. It fails so miserably that I have to do all of my work at the office.

  Very nice laptop. Had to turn off ""S Mode"" to install software other than Microsoft apps. Camera is good quality and output on Zoom meetings.

  It is a nice external looking laptop, but I am really disappointed with its performance, it was bought for educational purposes, in order to give opportunities for low-income artist children in Venezuela to learn design applications, but from the beginning the computer came with pixels dead on the screen and unfortunately the processor has not been enough for tasks that our old i5 computers that we have if they could do.

  I just received the laptop today and was very excited for the sleek design and touch screen feature.  However, after the initial set up is completed, while I and my wife were happily enjoying youtube movies, the laptop crashed multiple times for no reason - I made sure all the windows updates are completed (e.g.., accepted the windows updates and restarted multiple times). Made sure the laptop was using power cord, and also tried with a battery power only...  The symptoms are either the screen went frozen completely & no response on keyboard.  I had to press and hold the power key for like 10 seconds to force the laptop to reboot!!  Such crash happened like 8 times or more.  Frustrated!

  It is a great 2 in 1 laptop for the price. There are only a couple of issues. Firstly, the battery life is not as long as other high-tier laptops. Secondly, the graphics card also is subpar in comparison with other high-tier laptops. Nevertheless, these two aspects are to be expected from a mid-tier laptop. The touch screen is great, and also the cpu, ram and storage. It is a great product for personal and professional use. It needs to be noted that if you are into graphic design, the colors in this laptop are a bit opaque.All in all, an awesome laptop at an awesome price, 5/5!

  Be aware that the Dell ""pen"" that is suggested for bundling with this laptop does NOT work with this model.  The info provided by Dell online has conflicting information.  I had ordered and returned the ""pen"".  Other than that, it's a great laptop.

  I purchased the above noted computer and used it a few about 12 hours over 6 days.  This morning the screen failed to come on.  At first I thought it was not turning on, but when I started to pack it into the box for the return, the laptop was hot.  I got it powered down and packed it up for return.I do not think this laptop was new.  The box had a shipping label from some distributor (not HP), shipping it to a Best Buy in NJ.  The Windows build on it was nearly a year old so I think it is likely this was a refurbed machine or it has been sitting on a shelf for quite a while and acquired by the Amazon seller.I'm out $100 as I paid to get the files from my old laptop transferred to the new one and had to pay for shipping with insurance.  I understand why Amazon doesn't include many of these laptops under Prime - I'm sure you can figure it out yourself.

  Well, here’s what 1000 nits looks like.I was expecting super bright, and that it is. Here are the positives of this laptop:  *Thin and light  *Virtually edge to edge screen (did I mention, it’s bright?)  *Plenty fast  *Fingerprint reader works really well  *Half a terabyte SSD  *Privacy share screen can be turned off (really dims display)  *Getting awfully close to Spectre quality  *Keyboard has short but good tactile feel  *About any sale $$ makes this a darn good value  *Charges really fast  *Backlit keyboard helps (low-contrast) keys  *Newer Iris graphics has a punchHere are the negatives (to me):  *Movable lower ‘lip’ on USB-A ports are certain to break off (but at least it has a USB-A!)  *Battery life definitely not 11-13 hours, but good (not sure what EVO was supposed to guarantee)  *No pen or HP leather case came with mine  *No advanced power option sucks (but that’s a Windows thing) so can’t adjust fan or stretch out battery  *That nice screen shifts backlighting emphasis as you adjust the screen angle (annoying). My Dells don’t do this.  *Dells just seem a bit more ‘solid’, but that’s subjectiveVery nice laptop—especially at this price level. I don’t do gaming, so I can’t speak to that. The ‘high’ is the screen—SO bright! The low is that screen—brightness ‘rolls’ in intensity as you adjust screen angle.

  This laptop is light and fast. The keyboard is responsive. Its backlit function starts working once you type, so I haven't had to switch it on to get it to work. the fingerprint function is very efficient. If you have difficulty getting all your print in for one finger as it prompts you, it allows you to enter print for another finger. Once you do that, your access every time takes only a moment. You can type and do a lot of work with it for several hours without having to recharge. The ports are accessible and there are enough ports for all identified uses. I compared its specifications with those of the same model at HP and the match was perfect. In other words, it's like ordering it at a much higher price directly from HP. I haven't used it for gaming yet.

  I purchased this laptop September 15, 2020 and received it on September 21. It took me a few weeks to get everything like I wanted it, and then in mid-October I started getting a black error screen stating that the cooling fan on the computer was not operating correctly. The computer would shut down and I could log back in with no issue.  At first this only happened rarely, then began to do it multiple times a day, and also the fan would make a very loud sound. I contacted HP Support and they arranged for me to send it back for repair.  I am pretty disgusted to have paid so much for a laptop and have to send it back for repair less than 3 months into using it.  I have owned several Dell laptops and never had an issue like this.  I'm not impressed with the laptop, but the customer service was #1.

  Well, the laptop overall is awesome!! For more details just go to the Asus page or Youtube.Now, for the hard part. I am currently living in Mexico and this model won't be available here and that is why I decided to get this laptop from a third party seller (more $) trough Amazon (+ import fees $ + shipping cost $). I know there are probably cheaper ways to get this but I decided to go with Amazon convinced they will handle all the paperwork and the import process.Unfortunately I was wrong. For my particular case, Mexican government has a set of rules called NOMs (Mexican Official Norms), and those apply for any foreign product with a cost higher than &1,000.00 USD. There are several NOMs a product has to comply with and getting the certificates is a rather long process that involves sending the product to a specialized lab for testing and a really long time waiting on the federal agencies for any response. The NOMs are in place to ensure a foreign product can be used with out harm within Mexican territory.While I was researching all these ""fun"" rules and their applications, I got to realize that they are aimed to the big importing companies. The ones that get a foreign product to be sold in Mexico, and in my case I am just a final customer looking to buy an awesome laptop.In my opinion, getting this certificates is the job of the ones like Amazon or the third party seller I got the laptop from: Michael Electronics; since they are selling and importing this product to a foreign country.I went trough a rather worrisome process where my laptop got hold on customs office for over 10 days. During this time I was in constant communication with Amazon and Michael Electronics and although they were super polite, they were NOT helpful.In order to get my laptop released I had to obtain an especial letter from Mexican government to exempt 2 (of many) NOMs. Surprisingly, Mexican federal agencies where extremely helpful and they got me the letter in 5 business days. I then submitted the letter to the customs officials and finally got my laptop.In summary:I don't believe this laptop should be sold by Amazon without the required documentation, the risk of the product getting stalled in customs offices is very high and there is no warranty that Amazon will issue a full refund (according to the representatives I spoke with). I could complain about the NOMs but foreign country laws are way out of our control and then again this is WHY we use big selling companies like Amazon. I believe Michael Electronics shares responsibility too but I also believe this is WHY they choose to sell their products trough Amazon. According to Mexican government agencies Amazon has A LOT of issues related to Mexican NOMs so to them: PLEASE, it is not a new topic and I am NOT the only one.For everyone looking to import this awesome laptop from America beware of what happened to me.Best regards!

  I won’t write a lot because it’s a great laptop with a competitive price!And for me it’s the best you can buy write now!About my expectations:1. I didn’t expected a small scratch from the back!Which seems that I could have got an open-box piece. And if that is the case, it would be a disappointment!2. The battery 🔋 has a long lifetime which is good of course. But if you were doing your research without trying the laptop your self, you could find that they were exaggerating a little bit3. I really didn’t expected that there are versions do not include anime matrix but that didn’t bother me anyway because I would not go for it with an increase in ( price, available date, weight, thickness and whatever small wattage amount it would take)4. Finally, webcam. The second day I received the laptop, I needed to make a video call. Guess what, I spent almost an hour to check where is the cam 😂I mean it would not bother them to add one even in keyboard like HUAWEI matebook d14 for instance!

  You get a ryzen 9, an rtx 2060 and a 1080p 120hz display, this is one of the combinations with the best performance per dollar. Out of the box, the PC worked perfectly for me without much tweaking, only problem I had was that it came with windows 10 home rather than pro, which for my case, needed an upgrade; hope it's possible to ship pro versions in future. For the power it packs, this pc is thinner than most, definitely not MacBook pro thin but not much thicker than it, which is a definite plus; it's also a lot lighter than my MacBook with markedly better performance - that ryzen chip trades punches with the i9 in the Mac and gpu performance isn't even a question - for meI also like the fact that the pc comes with minimum bloatware, I didnt have to Uninstall anything at the very beginning, it's a clean, well designed and properly executed piece of hardware, gold stars to AsusI love this PC but I objectively have two issues with it:1. The success rate of the fingerprint scanning-caching function is abominable - 6/10 times I genuinely have to enter my pin and 9/10 times I have to rescan my finger, usually a different finger to get through windows hello. I really hope that Asus has a fix coming in soon, if it's a software related issue2. The backlight for the keyboard is uneven and if you're in a well lit room, then it's easier to see the keys with the backlight off. In my case, I use it late at night when I really need the backlight but otherwise by default it's offFor price to performance, it's a buy, right now prices are going down due to the upcoming 5000 series cpu and 30 series gpu models, if you'd want to wait for those, absolutely - from the looks of it, Asus has made a great pc even better in 2021, but nothing would beat the price for last year's model.

  I really like this computer. It is powerful and can run programs I could never run on my previous laptop. Just two main complaints...it does not come with a built in camera...that one is my fault as I should have read the details more closely but cameras are such standard issue that i did not bother to search that one out...second, the keys are nearly impossible to read at certain angles...it's like they purposively sat down and determined angles at which the markings on the keys would just disappear...it is not horrible as I am a touch key typist, but there are times I need to read the keyboard and this laptop is just not very friendly on that aspect...great computer otherwise...haha

  EDIT: Ya i got a bad model, but IMO Microsoft has more than enough money to make a laptop reliable especially as its competing with the most reliable laptop brand there is. The surface laptop isn't bad but it's not worth a thousand dollars or more when your own phone will likely out-live it. Also for the same price you can buy a laptop with almost twice the specs. Save your money don't support them and they'll have to get better if they want to compete.Update: it took about a month but they contacted me back. I have received a refund.  I will never purchase hardware from microsoft again. I will only support them through ms office and xbox. These laptops are too much design and way too little quality (minus aluminum case.) Expect a working model to work for only 2 years.Brand new started up kinda laggy and glitchy then suddenly I go through the start up process and change my wallpaper and everything seems kinda odd and slow for a brand new device.. so I go to restart it in a proper manner and boom. Now the screen glitches out and you cant do anything. Once you're able to log on with mininfreezes every 3 seconds and screen blinking, the desktop is empty and wont load any icons or even the task bar. Will stay like this for minutes and do nothing but blink on and off, and then most AMAZINGLY return to the log on screen. I lightly tap the underside of the laptop and notice the screen flicker more as I do it. It's like the hardware is so close together its touching and shorting out everywhere. I was hoping that microsoft would build laptops that actually do compete with apple but a quick google search shows 25 percent failure rates in microsoft laptops within 2 years, compared to 10 percent apple (leading competitor for qc and the surface laptop in my opinion.)

  I got the matte black lowest configuration 13.5"" for productivity purposes only. No gaming. I do plan on uploading a review video on my tech YouTube channel in case anyone is curious to know my user experience. But as the title says, so far so good, no issues. I will give it more time and will adjust my rating on this product accordingly if anything changes. The only thing that bothers me which also seems to be a common complaint regarding all surface products is the random adaptive brightness that you can't turn off. I've browsed many forums and other sources for solutions, people going as far as editing the registry... you should not have to jump through that many loops to toggle this display feature. Microsoft, PLEASE GIVE US THE ONE UPDATE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT. Other than that, I do like everything else about the Surface Laptop. Because I can't give half a star, I'm going to give 5/5 hoping Microsoft can just fix this one issue.

  Works good no problems. Matte black will show fingerprints easily but I don't care if you do get a different color. People complaining about the laptop being ""laggy"" need to change the power saver mode to performance the laptop auto sets it to save battery life which will make the computer slower. (This is on all Microsoft laptops now and has been for awhile) I would not recommend this for gaming thats not what it's intended for its a work laptop. If you want to play games get a desktop.

  Love this product. I got it in Matte Black, and I was expecting much worse for the finger print issue. This is very light and doesn’t bother me.I also have not experienced any lagginess as shown in other reviews. I have the i7 version.My screen does change brightness automatically from low to high without change in room, which is annoying but will get fixed soon hopefully.Overall, very stylish and capable, the keyboard and trackpad feels nice and I love the format of the screen (higher than your regular 13”).Also love being able to charge it with USB C!

  Buying this laptop was a bad mistake. I bought it in Jan and did not open it until late Feb / early march, I now realise that not opening it and checking the computer as soon as I received it was a huge mistake. When I did open it about 4 weeks later I realised it was faulty and now I'm stuck with the laptop as the refund option has disappeared from my Amazon purchase history.Upon turning on the laptop I noticed a thin blue vertical line on the left of the screen. I tried to find a solution on Google only to discover that the likely culprit is a hardware issue either with the display or graphics card. Today I logged into my Amazon account only to realise that the ""return/refund"" button is no longer there, so I am stuck with a new laptop that has a blue line down the screen. I tried to do a screen capture to show the blue line but the line does not appear in the screen capture, so this to me indicates that its the LED itself which is faulty. I have never heard of or seen this before. I decided to take some picture with my phone, here you will see the line, it looks black in the photos but its actually blue.Amazon or seller please help as I need this laptop replaced or refunded.

  When a mouse is plugged into a USB C hub the laptop just can’t handle it. The mouse lags and jumps around. Other laptops handle the hub fine, so I tried another hub and the same issue persists. Seems like I’ll have to plug it in separately, defeating the purpose of USB C.

  This is a very good laptop that is very capable of AAA gaming at high settings. It was packaged well with seals to prevent any kind of tampering during shipping. Included was a very basic, but free neoprene sleeve for the laptop. There are no straps or pouches but it is soft and will protect the laptop during travel better than if it were left exposed, but I would still suggest getting a carrying case or a backpack if you do plan on being portable with this. Also included was an HDD upgrade cable and screws in case you want to add a your own 2.5'' drive to the empty bay on the motherboard.The 1080p 3ms 144hz IPS display looks great and also has great viewing angles. If you've never used a 144hz Panel before, you can never go back to 60Ghz monitors for gaming again. 144Hz ruined my last gaming laptop because the difference is extremely noticeable (in general, it feels smoother when you move in games) compared to 60Hz panels. The webcam is passable at 720p. It's fine for chatting with friends or zoom meetings but not recommended for anything beyond that. It also cannot work with Windows Hello. The 10th gen Intel i7-10750H 6core 2.6Ghz base clock speed processor is very efficient, powerful, and has decent integrated graphics (which the laptop will prefer to use when you aren't playing games or doing any kind of intensive work that would require more GPU power). There's a lot of value in this laptop given that this CPU alone is sold for $400 and the laptop also has an RTX 2060 6GB. The RTX is the newest architecture that has the ability to do ray-tracing. If you don't know what that is, it's realistic lighting effects that developers are putting into games now, but you need a card that has the ability to process it or you can't take advantage of the feature.The RTX 2060 GPU is very capable. My average FPS with very high settings on Assassin's Creed Odyssey was 70. In GTA V on high settings, it was 115. Interestingly, this laptop has a button called Turbo. Now, there's no overt explanation for what it does when you take the laptop out of the box and don't read the manual, but it essentially overclocks the GPU for you and kicks the fans into hyper-drive to compensate for the extra heat involved with overclocking it. In terms of performance, on the two games I tested the FPS on, it gave me an average of a 10FPS increase. It is noisy though when the fans are on full blast. I have to give credit to the fans which Acer advertises as ""4th Gen AeroBlade™ 3D technology"" and the thermal management of this design because even when the CPU and GPU are being stressed, the laptop stays at a reasonable temperature, and by that I mean you can game with it on your laptop while sitting down without it becoming too uncomfortable. Aside from the Turbo button, there's also a Predator button on the keyboard. Pressing this opens an application that shows you the current temperatures of CPU/GPU and even ambient temperature inside the laptop itself overall. You can customize your lighting profile here, overclock your GPU with 3 speeds (normal, fast, extreme), and you can set your fan speeds to a custom setting or leave it on automatic. Because Acer has this application that controls these settings from OS, the UEFI BIOS is pretty sparse. You can't customize voltages or do any kind of manual overclocking, but since the application does all that for you, and many gamers don't overclock their system because they think it might be too complicated or risky, this makes it easy to do so with a simple click of the turbo button or drop down menus in the application. Speaking of the BIOS, you're going to want to go into it (spam F2 when the laptop is powering on), and disable the annoying POST sound. By default, when you turn the laptop on, it plays a sound file that sounds like a jet engine firing up for some reason. I turned it off because I found it incredibly annoying, but I'm thankful the option to do that existed in the BIOS. Other than that, there isn't a whole lot of customization to do in the BIOS. It also has WiFi 6! It comes with 16GB of RAM (two @ 8GB) but the DIMMS are user serviceable so you can put 32GB (two 16GB) if you wanted to with no issues.The OS comes per-configured somewhat, using performance metrics for the OS (such as not using the Aero theme). There is some bloatware which I recommend removing.In terms of build quality...this is where the laptop starts to show its low price point. The entire laptop is made out of plastic, and it flexes really easily, especially the panel. The plastic trackpad is just OK, it will function for web browsing and light tasks but it's not that responsive overall. The two small cutouts for the sound underneath the laptop is a really bad design flaw I wish more laptop manufacturers would get away from. Please just include top facing speakers. The speakers themselves are already not great, so when they're shooting downwards it makes it even harder to hear some games even when the volume in game is at 100 and the operating system volume is also at 100. For this reason, you'll want headphones to go along with the laptop.The ports available are:Left side--Kensington lock, RJ45 ethernet, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, 3.5mm audio jackRight side--Mini-displayport, HDMI, USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port (gen 2 adds charging capabilities even when the laptop is powered off), and USB-C using 3.2 Gen 2.Behind--Charging port. Kudos to Acer for putting the charging port in the center behind the laptop.Acer rates the battery as being up to 6 hours, but don't expect to do heavy gaming on this laptop while you aren't plugged in. I got about 2 with some minor downtime between games.One thing I want to talk about is the design of the laptop. It does look good, but I think Acer needs to think about the type of person buying this laptop. It's going to be mostly students who want a gaming laptop that they can also use to bring to class. I don't think that gaming laptops necessarily need to look like ""gaming laptops"". A more subtle design and the removal of any kind of LEDs on the exterior of the laptop would appeal to a much wider audience in my opinion.Overall, this laptop is an incredible deal. For what you pay, you're getting an incredible capable gaming laptop

  I bought this laptop as a last second mobile CAD workhorse (I'm an Engineering Technician). I did a TON of research on laptops close to the $1K mark that were also prime available on amazon. There are a few configurations of this laptop on Amazon, this being the entry level RTX version. So far, I've been blown away by the build quality and performance of this Helios 300. ACER has been my go-to for reliable computing for awhile now. Let's get to it:PROS:X2 M.2 slots for storage PLUS a SATA bay for even moreRGB zoned keyboard (and a great feeling one for gaming / everyday tasks)BIG vents on rear and sides, PLENTY of intake area on bottomThe thing just looks awesome, props to the design team for making a gaming laptop that looks professionalPredator sense UI is clean, loads quickly, and easy to useWith ray tracing on I saw around 60 fps on COD war zone with settings maxed.Not so much CONS:Fans get loud under load, but they react quickly and bring temps down FAST. It's an RTX machine, what can I say?Audio could be improved, especially BASS... but you've read this before with any laptop ad I know you'll be using headphones for gamesPower connector is in the rear center, you have to account for hardware layout here howeverBATTERY LIFE - probably the biggest complaint here, I would have absolutely spent an extra $100-$200 for better battery life if possibleSTORAGE CAPACITY - Would have liked a configuration on Amazon with 1TB + of this amazing nvme SSDIncluded case feels nice, but should have an extra pocket for the power brick (considering you'll almost always need it)All in all a lot of this goes without saying, but what is worth repeating is that this computer has 100% exceeded my expectations. This is the laptop to get mid-late 2020 if you want a 10th gen Intel chip and RTX. Thank you ACER!

  If you’ve heard of the Helios 300 then you’ve heard it’s one of the best, if not the best price to performance machines you can get. For $1,200 you’re getting a beautiful 144hz/3ms 1080p display that’s very crisp and looks great. The aesthetics remain similar to last year’a model with the exception of the back vents look way more aggressive, very nice looking. It has in take slits above the keyboard for increased cooling. The 10th gen intel and rocking a 2060 or 2070max q depending on your configuration. Well, let me get to the meaty parts. Easily upgradable, non soldered ram, dual channel, WiFi 6 non soldered, two nvme slots and one 2.5 SSD slot. The cooling is PHENOMENAL. I was going to repaste but I wanted to see how it performed with factory paste. Well, the highest it reached was 91c and dropped down to 88c immediately. It was averaging 80-88c while gaming for over an hour(far cry 5 max settings). I will repaste just because I like tinkering with my stuff, but the average user not need worry about this. The GPU stays even cooler. Those intake slits they added above the keyboard makes all the difference. Let’s see what else... the sound is good, typical laptop speakers, use a headphone. The material feels very nice. It does not feel like a “budget” gaming laptop at all. In a sea of overpriced gaming laptops with similar or higher price tags, this one is truly the winner. Also, I know ryzen is great, and you’ll read all about “8 cores vs 6 cores maaaaan!” I went through 3 ryzen laptops. While the extra cores and threads were nice, they’re meaningless for gaming, especially when they run slower and hotter.

  This laptop has a lot of bang for the buck.  I searched for a long time and have not seen another laptop with this price that was loaded like this.  Every other laptop had something that made it not as good.  When I got it, it exceeded my expectations.  It's fast!  It runs all of my games at the highest settings.  I love it!

  When I received this macbook and turned it on for the first time, it displayed an error message indicating that it was not able to find the mac operating system. I'm not sure what happened but I ended up having to call amazon who then transferred me to apple who then transferred me to someone else at apple who the had to talk me through reinstalling the OS. Overall, I had to spend ~4 hours of my life trying to fix a problem that this product shouldn't have had in the first place. I'm not sure what happened but I am extremely disappointed. You would think they would check to see if the OS was on the laptop before sending it out. But maybe I'm expecting too much

  So I was hesitant to buy a refirbushed computer but it arrived today and I am so happy I did. I read through the other reviews and checked all the negatives first. USB port works, runs fast, its 8GB as listed, not a scratch on the computer. Not one scratch!  No issues with set up. Camera works. Doesn’t come with extra long charger cord but description did not say it did. I’ll update again in a month but for the price you cannot beat this! Mine looks new. :)

  Bought a Macbook Air for my son - supposed to be refurbished and ready to go.  His current laptop died and he needed a new one urgently for college.  This one arrived on Sunday and when he booted it up it was showing that it was still under remote management of some public school system.  No way any quality control was done on this laptop before being shipped out - it would not even boot to a usable state. Extremely disappointed - had to send him to best buy to buy a brand new one on Sunday for an extra $250.

  Arrived with many distracting scratches or something in the middle of the display. Little black marks that won't come off. 90 day warranty says they won't accept returns for ""cosmetics"" so I figured we would just have to deal with it. I spent about 7 or 8 hours transferring all of my gf's nursing school stuff from the PC to the MacBook. Today, we discovered that we can't sign in to iCloud, iMessage or FaceTime (even with a valid Apple ID). After several hours of trying troubleshooting from the internet, we caved in and called Apple support.After about a half hour on the phone with them, they found that whomever ""refurbished"" this macbook formatted the SSD incorrectly. I had to completely erase the SSD in order to reformat it to the correct format. I lost all of that time spent transferring yesterday.....but it gets worse. After having erased the drive, reformatting it and trying to ""restore"" it to an older OS so I could properly upgrade it, it bricked. I now have a $700 paperweight that I can't return.

  Nothing much to complain about really. It's good. Just felt suspicuous about it. Like it felt like someone was trying to track where the computer went or something. The blue tooth was left on and the laptop turns on as soon as you lift the top up. I found that wierd. Very weird.

  Yo he tenido laptops HP que me han durado pero lamentablemente en esta ocasión no tuve la misma suerte con este modelo y proveedor ya que desde el primer día tuvo problemas con la actualización e inicio para ingresar al sistema. Toda esta semana he estado llamando a soporte de HP y no se ha logrado resetear el sistema por lo que decidí iniciar el proceso de reembolso y devolución. Ha sido mucho desgaste mental en lidiar con una laptop que se supone que al ser nueva debe trabajar óptimamente. Solo espero que la resolución de reembolso y devolución termine bien con Amazon ya que el envío de devolucion desde Costa Rica costo mucho dinero por lo que ojalá este comentario llegue al proveedor que por supuesto no lo recomiendo.

  I have had good luck with HP computers and this is not an exception. All hardware features seem good, though Bluetooth is sometimes flaky. Though not specifically an HP issue, on the down side MS Windows is too insistent that you use their browser, login to an MS account (why?), and download only their apps. Funny, I thought I paid for Windows when I bought the computer but I guess MS believes they have the right to nag the user forever.

  I bought this machine to run Linux and did not wait long to install the latest Ubuntu 21.04. It works well and so I proceeded to upgrade it to 16GB memory with modules I already had as well as with an extra disk drive in the form of a 2.5 inch SSD to complement the built-in NVMe SSD. After removing the back cover this was easy to do and I am perfectly happy with the result. Couple of warnings, though:* battery life under Linux is poor. I cannot comment on Windows but I get only about 3 hours of usage out of it before I need the charger again. I turned off Bluetooth and activated the 'power saver' setting in Ubuntu. I have not yet played with other power management options in Linux as these tend to be more involved.* Because I need to run virtual machines, I decided to try and upgrade memory to 32GB. Some websites suggest the machine can take this. I was aware of the risk that it would not work and only proceeded because I had another box that I could stick the memory into. Turns out that with 32GB installed the machine would not proceed past the power on self test. It reports memory issues with two orange blinks followed by four white blinks of the power LED. The memory works find in another machine. Btw. Dell documentation states 16GB max and question here on Amazon says it is 8GB per DIMM slot.* I made the mistake of booting into Windows once and connecting to the network. After this I tried to install windows in a VM using the license key from the BIOS (can be extracted under Linux, google it). Microsoft's crazy policies foiled the attempt. If you buy this and intend to run Linux better never boot the pre-installed Windows!Things I like about this laptop:+ matt display, which has a decent 1080p resolution that works great at this size+ extensibility, will add more storage later on once 2TB SSDs are more affordable+ Ethernet port!+ plastic case is actually not as flimsy as some reports made it sound+ pretty good value for moneyThings I don't like:- sound is thin and for video conferencing a headset is needed - business laptop!- USB 2.0 port only on the right-hand side.- can get pretty warm underneath - this is an Intel/AMD box after allHope this helps.

  The laptop my wife used mostly was starting to show its age.  The power cord was looking twisted and like it was going to fail, and came out of the laptop way too easy.Then recently, my wife was getting prompts that CHKDSK was running when she started it, and sometimes ran for about 10 minutes before she could use it.I'm a retired IT guy, so I calculated that with the age of the current laptop, its processor speed, RAM, video etc., that it was time to get a new one.My wife does some web searches, eMail, and plays some card games, so we didn't need a gaming computer.  This one is very affordable, and even folded, it's half as thick as her previous one.With that said, this is far from a business class laptop.  It is worth what you pay for it, but that is not a bad thing.  The processor is good, plenty of RAM for her needs, fingerprint logon (she now loves), and a solid state drive (no moving parts).The monitor is nice and bright and very easy to read, even in our sun room.  Battery life is about 3 hours.Also, understand that there is not a CD/DVD drive in this computer.  If you need to install something, you will have to put it on a thumbdrive from your desktop or other computer.  If you know networking like me, I just shared a drive on my home office PC and connected to it.This comes with Windows 10 Home.  You can go into the System settings and you can do an update to Windows 10 Professional if you need an OS that you can connect to a work network.  Price for that is $99.Everyday since we got it, my wife has thanked me for getting this for her.  That may not seem much to some, but from my wife, that's a homerun!

  Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can’t tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can’t see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as well👍🏼 So happy with it! Thank you!

  All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details.

  I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn’t work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed

  This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it.

  When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time.

  It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks.

  I was so hesitant on purchasing this laptop because I never had any Acer equipment. I am beginning a work from home and needed a laptop with an Ethernet port. I’d seen many laptops without an Ethernet port and a need to purchase an additional connector. I did not want to do this. Eventually, I came across the Acer Aspire 3 that had all I needed! It’s was delivered extremely fast; much sooner than expected. The set up was fast and easy. It looks and works great!!! No complaints as of yet.

  When the computer arrived we unpacked it.  Came back later to set up and found the cord missing.  Thought maybe like printers, it doesnt come with.  So I left a three star rating.

  Okay wow! I am so pleasantly surprised and so glad I took a chance. Even if I received a faulty one, I could just exchange for another but based off of negative reviews I was still a little nervous. This laptop is nearly perfect! Hardly any scratches, none that are even noticeable unless you’re looking for them. Keys work perfect, battery power seems great so far. Seems like a brand new laptop for a fraction of the price. Win, win

  I was very concerned about buying a refurbished item from Amazon, but after received the MacBook Air yesterday I have changed my mind. First of all let me tell you the item is in great condition, small scuff and dins in the back due to the normal use, display in excellent condition as Keyboard and trackpad. Battery hold the charge for 4 hours, better than expected and described on apple website. I was able to upgrade to IOS Mojave last night without any problem. I've bought a Mosiso plastic hard cover with Keyboard cover for $13 as you can see in picture. In conclusion, despite some bad reviews I can say I got an amazing Macbook for a very good price, that means an excellent deal was made, so I recommended 100% and you can return it anyway if you are not satisfied. Happy customer

  Best equipment I've ever purchased.  MacBooks are very expensive and I cannot afford a brand new one.  I am beyond happy!  the response time on this refurbished macbook air is so much faster than my HP laptop.  I don't think I'm ever going back to a windows based platform

  Item arrived in blank discreet packaging and was well packaged and well protected.  The physical appearance and condition of this MacBook was as close to new as could be and the performance the same.  There was not one scuff mark, scratch, smudge, or dent whatsoever.  There were two factors that gave away that it was refurbished--battery life doesn't seem to last as long as it should which at this point is not a huge deal, but within 6 mos to a year, may become problematic and require a battery replacement.  This isn't a huge deal for me because my husband and I own an iPhone/laptop repair shop and if need be, can perform the replacement of the battery fairly easily and inexpensively.  The second is that if you look really closely, it appears possibly that the screen had been replaced due to the rubber around the outside of the screen being slightly out of position and when you open it up, sometimes there is a lot of play and is a tad bit loose only at certain angles, which might actually be normal for MacBook Air laptops.  This is my first MacBook so I don't know much about what a brand new one would perform like but far as I am concerned, this was a 100% success and I couldn't be happier with it! I would highly recommend this product by this JemJem Renewed seller to anyone looking to purchase a Next-To-New as possible refurbished MacBook Air or Mac product but not willing to pay retail or Brand New price for it.  It is a great bargain and I would definitely purchase it again from there-in fact, I probably will never purchase a brand new Mac product if I can get the same item or similar item for a fraction of the price and basically same condition.

  Love, love, love this new laptop.  I work from home, and needed a faster, more reliable computer.  It is the best HP laptop I've owned so far.  The keyboard has the numerical keyboard also, which is a must for me.  Fast loading files, quick internet connectivity,  beautiful screen resolution.  Also, the red color is a matte red that reminds me of my favorite Christmas ornaments.The price was well within an average person's budget, believe me I shopped around for days before deciding on this one. I do not impulsively purchase electronics, my last HP laptop was 10 years old.  It's still working, slowly and updates are not working.  My last cell phone (Note 3) was 7 years old.  Upgraded that to Note 9 finally.  Point being,  I expect my electronics to last.  I normally don't write long reviews either, lol.  For what it's worth, I really do recommend this laptop.

  As a writer I wanted space for my works to be saved on and this is amazing for it. It fits all of my programs and is really easy to set up. The battery life is amazing so far and the screen is bright and easy to read from (and I love that I can adjust mood as well as brightness). It's thin and compact which is great because I can fit it in my bookbag, no problem.I got two of these; one for my friend. It is a beautiful piece of machinery and is very recommended; the touch or regular. It is worth the money, it shipped to me fast, and the computer was wrapped tight, so no scratches or problems. Now the only issue I have is speed, but because most of it is for my writings that's not a big problem.

  I am happy enough with this laptop; it is fine for my needs. However, I had no idea what ""Windows 10 S mode"" meant. Now that I have used it awhile I am not 100% sure I like the ""S mode"". It does have it's pros and cons, so read up on Windows 10 S before you buy this computer. You can turn off the S mode and run full version of Windows 10, but there is no going back if you do. I have decided to continue using the S mode, because I am not sure this system meets hardware requirements to run the full version of Windows 10. I'm not at all 'geeky' enough! :)

  The specs said 8GB RAM and also specified 2GB Graphics memory.Actual - 4GB in a slot and 4GB soldered. Total 8GB.However, the 2GB for Graphics was taken from the 8GB RAM, leaving a reported 5.95GB for the system to run on.I replaced the 4GB in the slot with a Crucial 16GB DIMM giving 20 GB total.Minus the 2GB that the GPU takes, that leaves 18GB for the system memory.So available system memory is 3 times what I had to begin with (~3x5.95GB) but it was a bit confusing.

  I just received this laptop so I'm just giving my initial thoughts. So the weirdest thing about the Vivobook is that the speakers are on the bottom, so the sound is muffled. The keyboard has a ""soft touch"" in comparison to my HP laptop. Personally I like the sounds of a clacking keyboard. The graphics aren't as crisp as my HP but it's not horrible. The number pad is rather slim, so the home and end prompts have been added to the 7 and 1 key (hopefully I explained that correctly lol). The battery life is alright so far. I've only been using the laptop for roughly an hour and 15 minutes and the battery is at 55%. Essentially this wouldn't be a laptop to travel around with without a charger.  The laptop feels sturdy, not enough to drop on the floor and it is okay but not bendy. Laptop is quiet but how long that'll last when teleworking is to be seen. There isnt a lot of heat either in comparison to my HP. So I'll update as time goes along***UPDATE 7/10***So the laptop is not charging past 79%... Weird. Very possible I'm the only one experiencing this but better let y'all know just in case it comes up again****FOLLOW UP****Sooooo there's a mode on the laptop that can restrict charging to either 80% or 60% 😂. That's weird but I guess it helps the battery. The option can be changed under MyAsus****April 26, 2021****Failed Wifi card and glitching when multiple applications open, so this is not heavy duty work friendly laptop. Fan is constantly running. Fine for light work and light gaming. The monitor isn't strong. Working on a tractor trailer there are bumps on the road and the monitor just flaps around.

  Overall I think it is a good laptop. The fan is a bit noisy but other than that a perfectly good laptop. However, mine had intermittent errors, similar to the ones I read in these reviews: the computer would BSOD with a hard drive read error occasionally when I turned on the computer. Other times it would crash with a memory management error. I think these errors occurred maybe 4 to 5 times since I bought the laptop.But I decided to return it since a new computer shouldn't be giving BSODs, and that it would probably only get worse as time went on.Here comes my advice, if you get this laptop, be sure to take a picture of every BSOD you encounter! When I returned the laptop as defective, the sellers tried to hit me with a 20% restocking fee. They denied that the laptop was broken. Luckily, I filed a claim with Amazon and they waived the 20% restocking fee, but if Amazon made me appeal the claim, I would have had no evidence to back up my claims of a BSOD. If you buy this laptop, save the original box and packaging with the anticipation of needing to return the laptop in 30 days. Also, know that the sellers are going to try to stick you with a restocking fee, and they aren't going to believe you if you claim the laptop is defective, so please document every error.Maybe I just got unlucky and you won't have any problems with the laptop, but know that this was my experience and the sellers were hard to work with.

  I bought this laptop (Ryzen 7) for watching streams and gaming. I have a desktop, but I wanted something I could bring with me for when I had to dog sit or not be at my desk. Since I knew I would be gaming, I opted for the slightly beefier Ryzen 7 over the Ryzen 5. It will only net you around 7 extra fps on average, so the jump isn’t all that necessary.The screen: matte, slightly muted contrast, but unfortunately dim. I’d say it only gets to about 75% of the brightness that I would like it to get to when I am in a fully lit room. But I really appreciate that the colors aren’t over saturated, it has a nice natural feel to the colors. The bezels are awesome, and the panel is sturdy.Gaming: So far I tested 1 game, American Truck Simulator. I bought this laptop to play games from early 2010’s. You do have to keep your expectations in check. This is not a laptop that will handle 1080p gaming at 60fps medium settings. I wanted something that could handle 1080/720 at around 45 on med/low. This will do that. You can watch videos on YouTube of Vega 8/10 graphics to get a good idea of what you will get.Speakers: they get loud, they aren’t tinny, but they are on the bottom of the laptop. The sound profile will change based off of what the laptop is on. Headphones/speakers are not necessary for this laptop, the speakers are high quality.Cooling: Very, very good when on a desk. Fan noise is very acceptable as well.The fingerprint scanner is quick, although I find myself going over it a lot trying to use the trackpad. The trackpad is very large though and tracks very well. The charging cable is incredibly portable, however I think most people would find the cable too short. All of the bloat ware was easy to remove, including mcaffee. The webcam isn’t anything special, but it’s over the screen which is great with how small the bezels are. I think for the price, this is the best laptop a student can get if they want to be able to do some gaming while waiting for classes to start. AMD is killing it with their integrated APUs, however do know that both the R5 and R7 use 2 gigs of RAM for the Vega graphics. Meaning if you have 8 gigs you will only get 6 gigs of useable ram. But you can get an 8 gig stick for 50 bucks and replace a 4 gig stick in the system to have 12 overall, with 10 useable. Having a powerful integrated graphics is worth the loss of 2 gigs of Ram in my opinion.

  The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe.

  This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already!

  Great, responsive seller, however, the screen on this particular chromebook is disappointing. If you're going from a Samsung Chromebook Pro there's no way you'll be able to live with this screen. While it's technically HD with the 1200-whatever by 720p, the font at any size magnification appears blurred and the the color gamut is washed out.It's important to note-- as I've just found out-- that there are more than 1 model of the x360 14b. This one is the one with the n4000, whereas Costco is currently carrying the n5000 one with the higher resolution of 1080x1920, and that's the model I'm waiting on.I don't know why HP released this one first, and while the screen is the sole feature that makes this unusable to me, it is still notable in that it's the first chromebook 2-in-1 to come out that actually includes Bluetooth 5.0. I'll update on the other model, which is only moderately higher in price.

  HP Chromebook X360 Model 14b-ca0010nr. If you're cheap like me and take FOREVER to upgrade things because, ""Hey, the old one works perfectly fine (although it's slower than snot and your kids say, ""Hey mom, you're laptop is a POS!"") Awesome HP Chromebook X360 for the price (snagged at $300)!  Totally suitable for the average surfer, email checker, movie watcher. NOTE: There are several variations of this same Chromebook that look nearly identical but are very different!  This WHITE keyboard one gives it away that it's the cheaper model! This one (14b-ca0010nr ) is not the higher end one, does NOT come with stylus pen and does NOT have backlit keyboard, has 4GB RAM vs. 8GB. Chromebooks DO NOT have Windows 10 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel - but you can still work with & save these files in your Google Drive), so keep that in mind - It's an App-based system with internet & keyboard vs. a traditional PC laptop or Netbook. Still, I absolutely LOVE this thing!  It's beautiful! Nice size 14"" screen, quiet (no fan, like in a PC), easy to transition to (especially if you already have a gmail account), user-friendly, a cinch to set up - took me less than 30 mins.  Only drawback I can see down the line is the white keyboard might get grungy (get a keyboard skin for around $12.)  Another NOTE:  I have an ancient printer that is NOT wireless and it won't work with it.  Most wireless ones will work, but check to make sure your printer is supported before purchasing! Highly recommend transitioning from a Windows based PC to a Chromebook for the speed and ease of use! Go watch a couple of ChromeUnboxed YouTube guy videos and then Buy it, already! UPDATE Aug 1, 2020: You can get the all white one now for $260!

  I simply could not look at this screen. It was either too bright or too dim and the resolution was not sharp at all. Practically blurry. Also, the touchpad was loose, that's the only way to describe it. When you put your finger on it, it clicked and you had to press quite hard to get it to react. Overall, this was a very cheap feeling machine. I know, it's inexpensive, but I guess I expected more from HP, from which I've always found good quality.

  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  The laptop is okay.. it functions well enough for my kids online school. However we’ve had 2 of the 3 charger cords stop working and customer service was not helpful at all. They made me send videos and photos and then stopped messaging me all together.. very poor customer service. Would not advise purchasing unless you’re prepared to do the repairs yourself.Edited to say that the company did replace both chargers after several weeks of going back and forth, shipping was a month long, but they did make it right which I appreciate.

  Es una laptop util y versátil la utilizo para mi trabajo desde casa, el procesador i3 combinado con la memoria de 8gb hacen que este portátil sea rápido por un precio bajo. Si tus planes es utilizarlo para trabajar o estudiar desde casa es suficiente. La cámara no es buena y los altavoces no son potentes, pero es suficiente para poder estudiar o trabajar rápido y eficiente

  I got this for my mother to replace a 10 year old Asus laptop she had been using. If there had been a 16GB model available here at the time I would have gone for that she does some photo/video editing, but it can be upgraded easily enough I suppose. That's not really a ding against this model in general though, since I'm sure there are 16GB versions available.Over all this laptop is great. It's sleek, the touch screen is responsive and it folds easily. The fingerprint reader seems reliable and unlocks the system fast. The camera is quite good for a laptop in this price range. The keyboard was easier to type on than expected, considering it has a 10-key off to the side. The speakers are above average for the form factor, but not something I'd listen to music on for extended periods. Battery life seemed fine in the small amount I tested it.For the cons, it does come with a few things installed you may not want, like McAfee privacy and antivirus stuff. I didn't have to spend too long removing bloatware, but there was a little. I'm not a huge fan of the USB port on the left side. It sort of ""folds open"" like a lot of laptop ethernet ports you see on thinner designs. The screen is only 1080p, but let's be real that's not really a con at this price range or for anyone that won't really utilize higher resolution because of eyesight issues. Aside from that there's not much to change. I'd love another USB port, but after using this for a day while setting it up, I'd be happy to have one for myself.If you're planning to use this as a tablet, maybe rethink that. At 4lbs+ it's still too beefy to carry around for that kind of task.As the headline alludes, performance is great in general. The NVMe drive is a nice step up from even your normal SSD, and having 6 cores that can boost up to 4GHz for some better single threaded performance is nice for a little laptop in this price range. If you're a light to moderate user just needing to do web surfing, email, excel, youtube and maybe some light photo editing, this model with 8GB of RAM is going to work really well for you.

  I enjoyed it until I started teaching zoom classes and the first class the audio went out. it arrived on the 14th and 2 weeks and 1 zoom class and audio program is out!

  Stay away until HP acknowledges and fixes the audio issues plaguing this laptop. No matter which VOIP program you’re using (Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Messenger, Google, etc) this laptop will lockup with a horrible buzzing noise and freeze. I spent approximately 5 hours uninstalling and reinstalling drivers with HP support without success.  It’s a huge issue that’s not being acknowledged by HP. As of 9/24/2020 this laptop is still unusable. Stay far away from this laptop and save yourself a headache... especially if this is for work or your child’s digital learning.

  I got this to be a secondary computer for me (I have a desktop) for work and on the go. It seems to be very functional for it's price. The SSD boots very quickly and RAM always seems adequate. I am only running MS office and web apps, so nothing too tough. Battery seems reasonable. A plus that it has a number pad.Edit: I also am having similar audio issues as other on here. I assume its a driver issue. I will edit if figured out. For now demoting from 5 to 3 stars.

  HP KNOWS ABOUT THIS MAJOR PROBLEM AND SITS IN COMPLETE SILENCE.  I bought this laptop as a gift for my wife who is earning her Master's degree online, where ZOOM/Skype/MEET online conferences are de facto. This computer arrives with a driver conflict issue between the Bang & Olufsen audio driver and the AMD graphics driver. This conflict causes the computer to suddenly freeze up during any online meeting within minutes, emitting a loud buzzing sound, ""...when the audio crashed the speakers kept producing a loud buzzing noise (like a snippet of noise repeating itself ad nauseam)"", (a comment from the HP support site). It makes holding online meetings impossible; in order to ""fix"" the problem one must perform a hard reset. Due to the COVID pandemic people have had to turn to work-at-home situations where Zoom/Skype/MEET online conferencing is essential. It's a BLACK EYE ON HP for KNOWING about this problem and continuing to sell the laptop, which is NOT CHEAP by any stretch of the imagination; not offering a working solution to the problem, and in fact telling customers that the product warranty does NOT cover this driver issue. OF course! Think HP wants to cover the cost of actually fixing all of these defective laptops, or in the worst case scenario, replacing/refunding the laptop. If you need verification about my commentary, please, I invite you to type into Google ""hp envy 2020 mic causing freeze screen"", and you will see the truth of the matter from hundreds of HP customers who, like me, trusted HP to be a good company.

  This laptop is extremely loud high pitch whistling sounds. It will give most headaches even bothers pets. People comment even over the phone about the sound it makes. Still runs uncomfortably hot. No drivers on Razer Support so forget about changing the SSD. No mouse drivers seem to work after reinstall. Cheap RAM and stock NVME drive no longer Samsung like years before. Chinese branded. Speakers are still terrible sounding even with THX “enhancement” software. Keyboard mushy and shallow. Performance isn’t that great either nothing special here. Get a warranty if you must buy I have a feeling it will be needed down the line. I’ll most likely be returning the system I got. To many compromises for high price. I’ve had 2018 and 2019 models and they all seem about the same returned all of them. I really wanted to like this laptop.

   I thought that the 2018 Razer Blade 15 was also defective due to high-pitched noise when the fan rotated at high speed, but this product in 2021 was even worse and headache with a terrible noise like a whistle as soon as the fan started to rotate.Currently, due to the influence of Cobid-19, it costs a very high shipping cost of over $ 400 to return, so I can not return it, but I would like to repair it.

  It's important to know what you're buying when you purchase this. It's a very thin laptop packed with all the latest hardware and display tech, at least the model I purchased. There are thicker 17 inch plus beasts out there, made out of plastic with better thermal performance. It performs extremely well for gaming given its compactness, it handles my office and video and photo editing with ease. It DOES run hot under full load, and a laptop cooling pad with fans is ideally necessary as the base can get quite hot especially against the skin. But I bought this for it's aluminum shell and portability, packed with all the latest technology. It does what I need it to do well, but, understand this comes at the cost of thermal performance without external cooling. The display is perfect in color and response, the 3080 accomplishes any task I can throw at it even at only 85w. The chroma lighting is beautiful and the keyboard performs well and is pleasant to use for office tasks. The audio with THX is quite good given its size.

  This is my second advanced model. I was excited to give the new 30 series cards a go and went with the QHD 240hz, 3080, 32gb ram etc. Like another review said it failed to boot when first turning on so I had to f9 and use razer’s factory recovery... then after about an hour finally got it booted. Once booted it’s fantastic...but yes horrible first run experience. Just plan on having to hit f9 if you get an error when first powering on. Secondly, yes the fans are loud - I don’t care as I use Astro headsets... lastly, yes 60hz really is all you get unless you’re gaming then you can use 240hz.. there are work arounds to keep it in gpu only... but not really they want I want to use it... would also be nice to have DP to DP to drive an external monitor at higher refresh rates... thunderbolt to DP or mini DP to DP is fine but I can’t find a cable that supports higher refresh rates. Overall I’m happy though. Really happy. Small upgrade over the 2020 advanced but I still feel it’s well worth it. Hopefully razer offers amd soon so battery life will be improved.

  I was pumped about this laptop, the cnc'd aluminum case and quality components had my hopes up! The machine arrived very well packaged and looked great. But, brand new and out of the box I couldn't even get the machine to turn on. Many startup failures later I navigated my way to recovery mode and reset the laptop to factory settings. After factory reset I was able start windows for the first time. Horrible startup experience. (thank God this didn't happen after using the machine for a while forcing me to loose documents etc.) I am very weary of this machine and considering returning it to save myself the future headaches it will most likely cause. If it cant start up straight out of the box how can you expect a machine to flawlessly startup after use?

  I was surprised because usually HP computers are the best in every way. However, this computer was gave me trouble from the first time I turned it on. It would cut on and off by itself.

  Bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter since  she has virtual school this year. I thought she could use it for school and download her games on it. I did not realize that a chromebook  is mainly for internet browsing.  It does not have  the Microsoft platform to download her games. Keep in mind I am 75 and not that computer savy. My son-in-law said he did not have enough computer knowledge to set it up to be able to download her games. Unfortunately  I did not read the return policy before ordering this. I would be charged a 20% restocking fee if I returned it.  I would  be out over $100 and not have anything.  I feel forced to keep it. So Buyer  Be Ware. Don't make the same mistake  I did.  😣

  If you're looking for an inexpensive computer that does it all.  This is it.  I did alot of research before purchasing.  I've had it for a few weeks now.  So far, I am very pleased. Literally everything is easy on this computer, including set up.  The speakers give quality sound.  The screen is excellent and not as dim as I was originally lead to believe.  The battery lasts all day.  It has 8gb ram so I can video edit when I am ready. You don't have to remember any of your passwords because Google Chrome does it for you. Downsides: when u flip the screen all the way around for tablet mode, the speakers become muffled because they are on the keyboard on the other side. So far, no one has made a protective case for it or a keyboard cover to fit it.  The keyboard is a little bit weird because it has a search button instead of caps lock.  And the whole screen button doesn't actually make your videos go full screen.  It just enlarges the window all the way. It is an overall high quality product that I am very glad I purchased and look forward to much productivity.

  This computer is great. Having worked with an Acer Chromebook for the last 5 years, I knew what to expect. I love Chromebooks for their ease in setup. It literally took 5-10 minutes to set up and I was already doing work. I was worried I would miss the 15.5"" screen size of my older Chromebook, but I don't. The screen is clear, the touch screen works great, and I love that I can flip the screen over and use it as a tablet if I choose. The keys are sleek and types faster than my older Chromebook. The computer is fast and really lightweight. I would purchase it again and highly recommend it to others!

  Very well built,  great touchscreen, good sound (for a laptop), and excellent keyboard.  Screen is average at best.  Specs are good, except internal storage.  64G is considered very good by Chromebook standards, but most people will need more.  Luckily, that problem is easily solved with a micro SD Card.  In short, Chromebooks are pretty much maintenance-free (software-speaking), and are fantastic for most simple functions, but they won't replace a Windows or Mac computer for anything other than web browsing, multimedia, and light gaming.  Also, the 64G isn't upgradeable or replaceable except by using external storage, which is lower quality and much slower.  It's ok, but there are cheaper and better values out there.  One more thing: if you plan on using a printer, do your homework.  I was able to get my Canon Imageclass working on it, but it was a great big pain!  HP printers tend to work much better out of the box with Chromebooks.

  In terms of specs, features, and performance, I'm generally finding this Chromebook an upgrade compared to prior Acer and Samsung models used for business purposes.  There are two problem areas that result in my present rating.  First is discovering after multiple orders and returns that there are no available keyboard covers or hardshell cases that fit.  Also, the keys are audibly clacky and could potentially be picked up via the microphone during videoconferencing.  Be sure to read current questions and answers before investing in this model.

I don't do any graphic intensive games, so no comment there.GOOD: I do like the screen size and image quality, touch screen, storage, RAM, keyboard, SSD startup times, backlit keyboard and slim design.  I think the price is consistent with those features.  It set up pretty easily.  Its slim.  It seems quick.  If not listed below, I suppose I'm happy with it.BAD: - Screen brightness change.  This freaked me out until I went online and found how to disable the adaptive screen.  I need a consistent accurate screen editing my pics.  Even disabled, I still see a brightness change slightly after I load an image.  I've done two support chats with mixed experiences.  I'll forward and check the images to see if my editing is accurate.  If so, I suppose I can live with the pause.- Oven.  I actually use the laptop in my lap.  I almost cannot use it plugged in due to the heat.  It needs better cooling.  Looking on-line, this seems to be a Dell design issue on some models.  The solution list, other than keeping it lint free, are all about non-lap surfaces and maybe cooling pads.  Um.  No.- Ports.  While its a little nice to be able to charge from either side, these little ports basically work with no USB/HDMI/SD without adapters.  There are 2 little ports that can charge or use an included adapter to USB.  There's a micro SD that fits none of my existing camera SD cards.  If I'm charging and cooking my lap, I can use the USB adapter for one accessory.  Very limiting and adapters are an expensive hassle to my exiting blue-toothless devices.On balance, for the money, I would say the features balanced by issues makes it pretty OK.  I can't compare it to competition, but I'd say if you use it for long in your lap for photography editing.. and you have full size SD cards.. check out the competition.

  DONT PUT IT ON YOUR LAP WHILE CHARGING. When plugged in the laptop becomes one step away from a fire hazard.  It gets extremely  hot. To the point I won't leave it plugged overnight not open and near a fan.Other than that its a nice computer. Runs great for photo editing,  not for gaming. Tends to crash even with early 2000 games, especially when plugged in when it Will overheat.

  Overall, I am very happy with my Dell XPS 13 9300. The trackpad and touchscreen have excellent sensitivity, the webcam and keyboard are of much higher quality than my previous laptop (admittedly, a much cheaper Lenovo Ideapad) and the screen resolution and color reproduction, while not world-beating, are more than adequate for all but artists and graphic designers.Having 16gb of RAM has made a huge difference in running multiple browser tabs. As a middle school teacher working remotely, I need at least 20 tabs running simultaneously to teach a class online, several with videos queued up. Gone are the awkward delays and freeze-ups that would sometimes plague my previous 8gb machine.I should certainly mention that my XPS 13 stopped working entirely after 8 days - so why the four-star review? I couldn't have been more impressed with both Dell and Amazon customer service; the prompt return calls, careful attention, allowing me plenty of options (repair or replacement) and ultimately replacing my laptop the very next day. It's a fact of life that complex machines can break; it's what happens after that in my opinion is most important.So, why not five stars? This new computer comes with the latest version of Windows 10, which is far more intrusive than I've experienced before. For example, there is no way to stop Cortana spying on you, disengaging Skype has become much harder, and installing the latest Dell drivers was made more challenging, in part because of changes to Windows firewall and bios. Specifically, it took almost two days of troubleshooting to diagnose and remedy an issue with the speaker driver - during which I was without sound.Nevertheless, my overall impressions have been very favorable and wholeheartedly recommend this laptop.

  I am a heavy user, multitasking most of the time with applications and screens. Wanted a compact laptop with high RAM, found this. I am very very happy with the performance, the battery.. Only wished it to have some more USB sockets and provision for sim card onboard. Overall a very good and elegant product.

  I have a $1000 Lenovo before this and this was only $400. I needed a laptop for college and this is perfect. It's beautiful. I love it way more than the Lenovo I had.My husband has a MacBook and even likes this better. I was so excited for this to come in!

  The unit arrived quickly but 48 hours after I set everything up it froze. Simple forced reboots don't work, had to factory set. After having to do this 3 times I called and Samsung agreed its an issue.bi sent it back, they received it. It's been a month since they received it. Over and over they promised to send a replacement. After weeks of this, and getting the tin around, they finally said they would refund my money if I could provide a receipt. I did. And a week later still no word it's been issued. Nightmare experience.

  I purchased this item spur of the moment during a lightning deal when then price was dropped to $329. Normally I don't make impulse purchases at that price range, but within ten minutes, the deal was 98% sold out, so I just took a chance and went for it. and boy am I glad that I did. I'm upgrading from a Lenovo C330, which I also like very much (especially for the sub $250 price I got that one at) but you're getting a lot more bang for your buck with this Samsung machine.** Just as a heads up, this is an updated model of the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 than was what was launched a year ago or so. (There's a video on Youtube that explains the differences -- which is not much. This is a lighter silver color and not the sleek, darker grey.) **I'll break my review down by features:- display: For the price, this display is incredibly sharp. Like, surprisingly nice. My other computer is a 2017 Macbook Pro and I can honestly say that this one is almost on par with the retina display on the MBP. For me personally, display is always the most important single item on a working laptop as low pixel count, resolution and bad colors can lead to severe eye strain and fatigue. This machine doesn't come with Chrome's Night Light feature out of the box, but you can activate it (search on Google). In the past, Chromebooks were known for being very cheaply built computers with low quality components, but I'm very impressed and equally happy with this computer's display, especially for $329.- keyboard: This is where Lenovo and others have Samsung beat. The keyboard is fine, but the keys themselves feel quite small and there's too much space between keys. I feel like I have a much quicker and accurate typing experience on virtually every other keyboard. In terms of layout... It's just your standard Chromebook fare. I will say this is probably my only real disappointment with the machine. The trackpad is also fine. It's nothing spectacular, but doesn't feel particularly cheap. All gestures and two finger scrolling works no problem and there's a nice solid (and quiet) click when pressing the trackpad.- battery life: The battery life is pretty bonkers on this machine. After a couple of console prompts, the battery capacity is shown to be 39 watt hours. This is a huge bump from the Lenovo C330, which already has incredible battery life. My guess is the larger, higher res display necessitates the additional battery capacity. I've not been through two full cycles yet and have been using the machine all day for work during the day and then Youtube/Netflix in the evening. I think it's safe to say that you easily get a full day's worth from a single charge even with lots of video and graphics-heavy use.- speakers: They're not that great. Most computers at this price point have downwards-facing speakers, and this one is no exception. The speakers don't ever get that shrill or rattle, but in terms of overall volume, they're not very loud. I ended up using headphones for a couple of video seminars I had to do today because the speakers were just not loud enough.- cameras: I haven't tried them yet. I don't really use webcams on computers and don't see myself using the cameras on this one much.- build quality: This is a tough one to measure for a few different reasons. It appears that the slate gray Plus V2 has an aluminum/alloy case, but this one is all plastic. It feels sturdy enough, but definitely has that plasticky feel. The keyboard in particular is where it feels especially cheap. But even with a full plastic build, there's really no keyboard or display flex, and the computer feels solid in my lap or on a table. The screen hinges are also pretty sturdy and stay put when you're banging away on the keyboard.I've got to say, even at $400, I still think this is a solid buy. If you're able to grab this during a flash sale for $350 or less, then definitely go for it!EDIT: After only using the machine for a couple of days, the GPU/CPU/internal graphics went completely haywire out of nowhere and the computer became completely unusable. Trying various resets didn't work and opening the display to tablet mode and back didn't help either. The replacement machine is also flickering, giving me the impression that these newer silver models have a major issue with the stability and reliability of the graphics and display. There are a few others who've posted similar issues in their review of this computer here. Still debating on whether to keep it or not because I really want to like this computer but am worried about what happens after the return window and warranty period expire.

  I wish I could rate this a full 5 stars, because I honestly do love this Chromebook. As a broke college student, this was pretty much at the upper end of what I could afford as all my classes required me to use some aspect of a laptop, and I was getting annoyed at just having a tablet. I did pay full price for this, and I've had it for a few months now so I feel I can leave an accurate review.One of the first things I noticed when booting up the laptop was the screen. The screen is absolutely beautiful, and I don't know how Samsung delivers for such a low price. It is not the highest resolution by any means, it is after all a Chromebook, however you can barely tell unless you're staring at the screen an inch away (which I do not recommend for the sake of your eyes). The touchscreen works well too, and I've never had any issues with it. The second thing I noticed was the keyboard, and I'll be honest, this keyboard is on par with higher end laptops. It doesn't feel cramped to me at all and my typing speed is just as fast as it was when I used a hand-me-down Microsoft Surface Pro 4.Let's talk about the body. The whole thing looks like it's one unibody piece of aluminum, however only the top lid is metal. The entire bottom part, including the housing for the keyboard, is plastic. The bottom of my laptop already has scratches from me moving it around on a metal table, which isn't a deal breaker but it does mean the structural integrity of the bottom is slightly weaker than it would be if it was all metal. The speakers are also on the bottom so it can be muffled if you don't slightly prop it up on something (though the speakers actually sound pretty good and get loud enough to hear outdoors). Again, for the cheap price, this doesn't really bother me. The other hardware impressed me as well, with 2 USB C ports, both of which are on the same side, one standard USB port, a headphone jack, micro SD card slot, and physical power/volume buttons.In terms of software, this obviously runs Chrome OS and it does, as specified, have Intel Celeron. Not extraordinarily fast but I rarely notice it lag unless I have excessive tabs open. It has 4gb of RAM and mine has 64gb of memory, which I have yet to run out of. Then again I don't download a lot of things on here save for papers and a few apps, and the papers I delete as soon as I turn them in. No major complaints here.The pen. Ah the pen. I use the pen for math notes, as my teacher uploads PDF files of them for each class. The sensitivity levels are fantastic and you can get super thick or super thin lines with ease. It feels very natural, and palm rejection works well (given that the app you're using includes palm rejection). I have also used it for a little doodle for another class, and that all worked just as well. The pen conveniently fits into a slot on the right side with a satisfying click so you know it won't fall out.That being said, let me talk about the things I'm not quite as fond of. Being a Chromebook, I knew I would only be getting Google Play apps and I was prepared for that. Luckily, this laptop does have the Linux Beta, meaning if you know how to work a Linux system you can download apps outside of the Play Store. I was able to download Steam and try out a few games, however I have never gotten one to run anywhere near smooth enough to make an enjoyable gaming experience. Oddly enough, I have tried Don't Starve both on Steam and on Google Play, and the version on Google Play runs infinitely better. It was made specifically to be played on a portable device so it is less task heavy, however I have a sneaking suspicion that Steam in general just does not work well on a Chromebook. Again, not a deal breaker for me, but something to be aware of.Finally, something that bothers me to no end and is the entire reason I took off one star. I haven't read many other reviews of people experiencing this, so I wonder if this is something wrong with my laptop, however it is SO SLOW to start up. I have to open the laptop at least a minute before I expect to use it, because it takes forever to wake up. Another issue is sometimes when pressing the power button on the side it doesn't do anything, and the only loophole I found to that is pressing the refresh button along with the power button. This is actually really annoying, and I don't understand why the button doesn't work 100% of the time. Still is not a deal breaker for me, still not a reason to return it, but it is rather annoying when dealing with this every single time I want to wake the laptop up.Overall, I do absolutely love this Chromebook. I never thought I'd get used to using one, however this laptop has proven me wrong. Minus the ding for the slow start up speed, I honestly would recommend this to anyone looking for a little portable laptop or an entry level one for school.

  Ordered this but received a cheap, older model worth half the price, although I was charged for this device. Not sure who was responsible for the mix-up, but I'd be very careful when ordering. I really was looking forward to giving this as a gift to my daughter but was completely cheated by its arrival. Returned the cheap model for a refund.

  This laptop has been my first new laptop since around 2012 when I bought my Dell Vostro 3460 so it has been a long time since I had a new portable thin and light. Let me just say it has been too long! I bought this for the powerful specs and amazing value! So far it has surpassed my expectations! The Ryzen chip flies through windows and the Samsung 512GB m.2 SSD makes the computer boot to windows in mere seconds. The integrated GPU, Vega 7 works amazing and can play rocket league with great frame-rates. The sims 4 plays well too if that is more your thing. I have used this for a little over a week now and it has been a wonderful little device to use. Battery life is strong on the settings I use which is msotly battery saver stuff to just run office and write emails, so it always lasts me through my work days. The fingerprint scanner is a life saver with windows hello integration. The privacy camera shutter is an amazing feature every laptop should have. The trackpad is a good size and the keyboard provides a reasonable amount of feedback but it is a bit shallow for me coming from Dell laptops it doesn't diminish the typing experience too much it is a breeze to just fly through emails on this thing. This device would be perfect for students who want something portable it also with plenty of horsepower for the more complex applications like the adobe suite of applications. Although the display is a bit dim, its pretty color accurate and gets the job done. plus with pen support where can you go wrong? I'm honestly surprised this thing hasn't gotten more coverage in tech media for its outstanding value and great quality. I'm very happy with this purchase and I think you will be too. if you are in the market for a laptop that has the best value for buck, this is unmatched. only being edged out by the Acer Swift 3, but keep in mind this configuration specifically has 16Gb of RAM rather than 8 so it should last longer in heavier workloads. 10/10 would reccomend.

  You can see so many YouTube videos saying what a hot deal this is... and it IS!I am generally using this as an office adjunct, some light video processing, and some home utility funciton.I do not have the Lenovo pen or any other active pen so I can't speak to that.  But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..  But I feel software updates should fix this.

  This model is 81X20001US. It compares to the 81X20005US, Available on Amazon for $599.99. Only major difference between the two (besides the Amazon or Costco exclusively) is the addition of an included stylus on the Amazon model.Ryzen 4500U vs 4700U256gb vs 512 GB storageReally, for $150 more, it makes a pretty decent machine under $1000 into a powerhouse. This is not going to win graphical awards, but may just be the highest end spec on a sub $800 laptop on the market.I read lots of reviews. I hear that if you get a unit that performs less than expected, exchange it immediately. Apparently, some believe 1 in 3 Lenovos are faulty in some manner and should be exchanged. Do the research and take the time you need to make a decision right for you and yours computer consumption needs.

  It was a shame I didn't end up going with this laptop. The keyboard is just too sub-par compared to lenovo's own thinkpad lineup. The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.

  Let me start with this first, I like this laptop and I think it's a very good buy.The best thing about this laptop is the big 17.3"" IPS screen, it's sharp with good viewing angles and decent brightness.The 11'th gen Intel CPU performs very well, everything loads very fast and it handles multiple tasks with ease.Wireless connectivity is also great, connection is fast and stable.The speakers are decent for a laptop, OK, nothing more.The keyboard is good and spacious but I wish that the keys were bigger, there's a lot of space in this laptop to fit larger keys like CTRL, ALT etc. and especially the small up/down arrow keys are requires more attention because I find myself hitting the shift key when trying to press the UP arrow key or the UP key while wanting to press the DOWN key.I am also missing a light indicator for the Caps&Num lock keys.The touch pad is large and comfortable to use, responds very well.Battery life seems decent, I haven't tested it too much but it seems you can squeeze out at least 4-5 hours of work maybe more if you use lower brightness.Regrading ports, you get 2xUSB3, 1xUSB-C (5gbps), 1xHDMI (2.0), 1xRJ45 LAN, 1xUSB2, 1x3.5mm audio - good but I wish Acer had included Thunderbolt 4 since the 11'th gen Intel processors support it.One point I would like to raise is the lack of (any) technical information regarding this laptop, no detailed specs regarding RAM, NVMe SSD drive besides the size, no technical info, upgrade parts, IPS panel color gamut specs etc.I wanted to upgrade the RAM and I could not find any info which RAM this laptop has and what speed it's running.So for other potential buyers I want to share what I have found:This laptop comes equipped with 8GB DDR4-2666MHZ dual channel memory (4GB soldered on board + 1X4GB expansion module).This seems a bit odd to me because according to Intel specs the 11'th gen I5 and I7 supports DDR4-3200MHZ, so I can't figure out why Acer used lower speed memory ?Who knows, not a deal breaker but little bit disappointing and I wish that this info was written somewhere for potential buyers.The 1 memory module you can upgrade is a Kingston 4GB DDR4-2666MHZ model: ACR26D4S9S1KA-4 .I wanted to upgrade the RAM to 20GB by replacing it with a 16GB module and I also wanted to preserve some of the dual channel functionality by utilizing Intel's dual channel ""flex mode"" because the memory modules do not mach in size.So I have bought the most similar spec'd 16GB DDR4-2666 module I could find locally made by Kingston model: KVR26S19S8/16.Installed the module and the laptop booted with no problem, identified the new RAM properly and also enabled dual channel - great but again I wish someone had written what compatible memory you need to buy in order to upgrade.The 512GB NVMe SSD installed is made by Kingston, you can also install an additional SSD for more storage.Acer included a bracket mounted inside the laptop with a cable already connected and you also get a bag with 4 screws to mount the additional SSD drive.So overall a very good laptop for daily work, web browsing and watching movies, fast CPU, I really like the large sharp screen and the big keyboard layout, price is great for what you get but I would prefer a faster RAM configuration and 2 RAM slots without on board RAM.Acer could have perfected this laptop by doing some minor changes to the keyboard, putting a larger capacity battery and offering 16GB version for a bit more but I guess there are compromises you have to take when aiming for a competitive price point.Hope this helps...

  I just needed an inexpensive PC laptop for light gaming, email, and web browsing. This Acer Aspire fit the bill perfectly for me. It's not a powerhouse, so would not play heavy online games very well, but for the games I play (mostly hidden object and time management games) it is perfect. The display is beautiful, and it is lightning fast because of the SSD. I am very pleased with my purchase.

  I was in love with it for the first month.  Was perfect and ran well. Unit was off for 24 house plugged in. Went to turn it on, and wouldn’t boot up. Then I noticed it was extremely HOT and unplugged it. It continued to heat up. I had to keep a fan on it for 14 hours before it stopped and went cold. Have to ship back to Acer. They said they have never had this problem before. Hmmmmm.....now to wait 4-6 weeks for an answer.  I need a replacement. I have no time for the waiting game.  So not cool doing tax time for an accountant. I would find a different model. Feels like they sat in a warehouse for years. Manufacturer date is 2014. Makes you wonder

  The device was perfectly fine for everyday use, but this thing couldn't even stay on for 45 minutes of minecraft, and that's not a very graphically intensive game. I'm not sure what was wrong specifically, but the device would black-screen while playing nearly any game (Don't Starve, Minecraft) and freeze after less than an hour without fail. I did manage to play a few hours of Sims4 without issue, but I'm not sure if it was just luck or what. I did minor photo editing too using photoshop/lightroom with no issue. The laptop also got hot and loud very quickly. I'm not a total genius when it comes to computers or their parts, but this seemed a bit abnormal for me since my boyfriend's 5+ year old $150 laptop does all of the above JUST fine. I just wanted something a little newer, but now I regret shovelling out $700.

  Have it for close to 2 months.  I am very happy with it.  Everything is snappy.  The screen display is very good, i.e. sharp, bright, and no reflection.  After the 30 days return window, I added a 2nd HDD with Sony 860 Evo - 500gb 2.5"" SATA drive, and replaced the 4gb ram with a Crucial 16gb Ram. Now the laptop has 756gb memory and 20gb ram.  It has only 1 slot for ram.  The other 4gb ram is soldered into the motherboard, I guess.  Total cost of upgrade $120.  Don't get me wrong.  The laptop ran fine and fast without the upgrade.  I did the upgrade because thanks to one of reviewers who said that it can be done.  And it's always good to have more than less.  So I did it.

  Well, got my brand new laptop on the 16th. Actually received it earlier than expected, kudos to Amazon for that. Unboxing experience is pretty satisfying, the computer is very well packed and it even lifts up when you take ot out of the box it comes in. Came with the stylus, a charger and two dongles.Fist of all, buid quality is premium, you can see and feel that it is well made and sturdy, hinges work as advertised and you indeed can open the lid with just one hand.After turning it on and configuring it, all went well, did the normal updates that all laptops require out of the box, installed chrome and went on my way to start backing up my data and rearanging folders.Here comes the first issue I found. I have a Logitech MX Ergo, pretty nice trackball mouse that I have enjoyed for the last six months or so and worked flawlessly with my previous Acer laptop, I went and installed it on the Asus and things started to happen. Bluetooth conectivity is bad. The mouse disconnects after just a few seconds being still. I mean 3 to 5 seconds, this is so annoying, everytime you move the mouse it lags. It drives me crazy.I have at least three days trying to fix this and nothing. Updated the BIOS to version 303, reinstalled all drivers, power management options are very limited in this version of Windows, so nothing seems to fix it. The MyAsus app is pretty mu h useless, all disgnostics say no issues found. My best guess is that bluetooth tries somehow to save power and goes to sleep, but there is no way to override this.I did tried the mouse in two other computers and it works fine. So I am sure its this laptop. My bluetooth headphones don't work very well either if they are paired both to the computer and phone, because lf this I decided to use the dongle for the headphones and discovered that it has a hissing noise, when connected through the usb c port, both ports. This does not happen when connected trhough the same dongle to my Pixel 4, so laptop again.Lets talk battery life, 10 hours, its a lie. I can understand they tend to  overrate this times, but in my case if I get 5 hours I am lucky, and this is only using Lightroom and a Sandisk Extreme SSD drive connected through usb c. Not sure if this battery is faulty, to be honest.Laptop gets a bit hot, but nothing too serious in my opinion, its understandable being so thin and small.Overall, these are the things that have bothered me about this laptop so far.Now for the good. THE SCREEN! is amazing. Even as little as it is, quality is superb, colors are very true, is super bright and sharp. I love the 4K resolution, it allows to use very small icons so you have a lot of space when working, I love this. I am currently using it with 175% zoom, and its great. Tried going smaller but it was too small. Sound on this is very good also, surprisingly good.Another thing that I liked a lot is the trackpad and the numeric keyboard function, very usefull once you set your brain to use it. Haven't used the stylus as much, I don't care about it too much. I wanted a 2 in 1 because I travel a lot and its light and can be used as a tablet for entertainment and browsing, which is great when you are on an airport. And the power allows me to handle data and peocessing for work without having to own another bigger more powerful comouter.And last but not least, this laptop is fast, paired withmy SSD file transfer are in the order of 700MB/s which is great, coming from an HHD averaging 20 to 50 MB/s, so very useful when working with phlto and vkdeo editing.This review might be a bit longer. I will try and update about the bluetooth issues and usage all together.UPDATE:So, I was watching a video last nigjt and saw this thin greenish line at the bottom of the screen, at first I thought it was from the video itself but no, is the screen. It has a fault. I did not see it at first but when I lowered the screen brightness it was very noticeable. I thought that it appeared later on, but I did took a picture lf the laptop when new out of the box and the stripre is there. So it came like this from the factory.I will have to send it for a repair. I am very upset because of this. This is a brand new very premium laptop.

  I am a computer user for over 20 years, using both Mac and Windows, my current laptop is a Surface pro 4 I bought 4 years ago and a 10 year old Imac, that still works. I needed a more powerful machine to use Zbrush 3D, this one was reccomended to me by Intel for that purpose. I liked the looks, that it has a touchscreen with pencil, good memory,  Plenty of space etc.It arrived on Tuesday and since the moment I turned on, the screen was “washed” on one side ( see attached photo) ,And it was superhot. I knew that it may get fixed with an update, so I did the whole windows update and Bios update from Asus site, that resolved those problems.Then, it could not connect to the internet, or connects sometimes and disconects etc...annoying. I tried to play the tech support myself and got to the point that it connects but when I put it to sleep, it will not connect automatically even if “connect automatically” is on, I was willing to live with that, but then the laptop started to shut off by itself several times, I had already installed zbrush and gotten some of my personal info in it, the only solution was to “ re-install windows” , I did just that, it worked for 2 days until it got some updates today and now I got the “blue screen of death” (photo attached), it re-started 3 times and told me to use the asus diagnostic tool which I did and it came out as “warning: cannot detect HDD” !!!  Wow... (photo attached).I end this 5 day ordeal by sending the laptop back to Amazon for a refund, it is a shame because I had a 22 “ art tablet coming today that I was planning on using with this computer for my 3D Zbrush sculpting.I am not sure if Asus or Microsoft are to blame for this bad product, but I will have to buy a new Imac ( Will change my zbrush license to move it to Mac).I will stay away from Microsoft products for now (Surface is not perfect, but I learned to live to its issues, like screen freezes etc). and unfortunately will have to pay more for a Mac, but peace of mind and getting work done is priceless. Thank you for reading and best wishes for 2021.

  I almost bought a 2019 Lenovo Y540 but then I found this 728c variant of the Nitro 5. No other laptops had a 144hz display with an RTX 2060 and 16GB of RAM. I bet a turnoff for many is the smaller SSD storage. For me, I just spent ~$100 on 1TB of SSD. for a total payment of ~1.2k I feel very satisfied.I am not a hardcore gamer. I only probably play 2-3hr sessions every other day if not like twice a week. I noticed that games like Valorant bring the CPU temp to an average of 75 Celsius. I can only imagine what happens if you play a higher demanding game like Warzone.Fan noise is as I expected with a gaming laptop. when you game it is loud, but if you game with a headset you will not hear it and it is not detectable on your microphone. When you are using the laptop for everyday use, every now and then the fan will turn on but on the quietest setting to cool things but turns off after several minutes.  I am getting used to it though.As mentioned at the top, SSD storage is small in comparison to competitors' laptops. It will not be a problem if you play only some games, but if you play alot, I recommend getting an additional SSD. You can easily find SSDs between the $100-$150 range, just make sure you know or have a friend who knows how to properly install it.The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because the battery life is very short. It does not deliver the 8 hours as described; more around 4 hours at most. I always play while plugged in. Playing unplugged will probably make the battery life even shorter! The only reason I noticed the shorter battery life was because I used a Macbook before this and their batteries last around 10 hours. I dream of the day that Acer rids of the 2.5” drive bay for a bigger battery :)I am super stoked to be an owner of this Acer Nitro 5. It has its quirks for sure, but for me, they are overshadowed by the perks. If you are a relatively casual gamer I really think you will like this just as much as I am liking it.

  I purchased the Nitro 5 with the i9 and rtx 2060, fresh out of the box I tried playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive. A game that's over ten years old, within ten minutes the cpu was at 90 degrees celcius, with the fans set on maximum. I tried undervolting the laptop, by .145 MHZ, this only decreased cpu temps by 5 degrees. I couldn't play any game, even a ten year old game, without the laptop trying to melt itself. That is awful. Anybody considering buying this, don't. You'll have a fried laptop within a year.

  This review concerns the model AN515-54-728C with the 144Hz display, and may not necessarily apply to other models.The LCD panel is model ""NCP004D"" from Panda.  A reviewer at NotebookCheck tested that display panel, and found a Black to White response time of 16.8ms, and a White to Black response time of 13.2ms, for a round-trip total of 30ms.  This means that despite being 144Hz, the time it takes for the pixels to fade in and out makes it look no better than a 60FPS display.  While testing a scrolling image, 72 FPS and 144 FPS looked indistinguishable, as well as 60FPS and 120FPS looking indistinguishable as well.The AN515-44-R5FT also has the same LCD panel, and I was only able to discover this information by reading reviews of that product.There's also some backlight bleed, but it's only noticeable in a dark room with a dark screen.  The backlight bleed was not annoying enough to be a problem.Additionally, the display is only 6-bit color, not 8-bit.Aside from the disappointing LCD screen, it has great components inside.The i7-9750H CPU is very nice and fast, and mine was able to stably undervolt to -150mV.  Every CPU is different, not all CPUs will be able to reach the same undervolt and run stable.When running all cores full speed, it had a VID of 0.86V, speed of 2.28GHz, and a temperature of 71C.  When undervolted, the VID fell to 0.8V, and speed rose to 2.76GHz.When running one core at full speed, it had a VID of 1.2V, speed of 3.9GHz, and temperature of 92C.  When undervolted, the VID went to 1.15V, Speed went to 4.3GHz, and Temperature went to 87C.Multicore performance was power throttled, and Single core performance was Heat or Power throttled.  Undervolting eliminated the Heat/Power throttle on single core performance, and reduced the power throttle on multicore performance, allowing a higher clock speed.  Huge benefit from undervolting here.The SSD is a real speed demon.  Despite being only 256GB large, it read at 1077 MB/sec, and wrote at 671 MB/sec (372 MB/sec sustained).The touchpad is okay, it's less laggy than one I previously had on a Dell laptop.The keyboard has dark red key caps that are difficult to read.  With every laptop having a different layout for where to place Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys, you'd need to read the keyboard to find those keys.  Having those in dark red makes it hard to find such keys.Additionally, the Volume keys need two hands to press, as the Fn Key and the Up/Down keys are too far apart that you can't reach them with one hand.My old laptop had keys arranged as ""Insert, Delete, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End"",  while this laptop has them arranged as ""Delete, Home, Page Up, Page Down, End, Power"".  I use Home and End a lot, so I keep reaching in the wrong place to try to press those keys.  I had to disable the Power key, because I kept hitting it otherwise.  I could get used to a different keyboard layout over time, it would just take a while.Aside from those issues, the keyboard has a very good feel.  There is plenty of travel distance, making it satisfying to type, and all keys on my product worked fine.I had extremely low expectations for the speakers, but was surprised when I heard them.  Bass notes under 100hz are actually audible on this model.  Very quiet, but audible.  I bet audio quality could be improved further with proper calibration.The USB ports and Power port were very tight, and required greater than usual force to insert the power adapter, or insert a USB device, they also made somewhat crunchy noises.All in all, I say very good computer, but bad screen.

  I get the white screen of death daily saying Chrome OS cannot be found.  I've powerwashed, reinstalled the software.  Also the trackpad stops working out of the blue and rebooting the device doesn't fix it.  I suspect it is hardware issues.Also the sofware is sooo buggy.  What is the point in having a fingerprint sensor if the device shuts down every time you close the lid and requires password.  Is that because the device crashed or was that just not thought out.....Linux apps are useless because they freeze the entire device every time I use Android studio.  The only way to resolve is to hold the power button until it reboots.  I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO WEEKS and I've had this many issues.  Do not buy if you are a power user.  If your not, but a cheep chromebook.

  Wafer-thin and packed with Chromebook features, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2020 (Galaxy from now on) is a beauty. In Fiesta Red, the Galaxy catches eyes and the form build looks like a colorful piece of thick cardboard.  Currently, Amazon is selling this for $799.99 ($200 less than I purchased the unit a week ago.) I work with Windoze and Mac professionally but at home, I enjoy using several Samsung tablets, the Chromebook Pro and other quality products from the company.I was really on the fence as I have a Samsung Pro from 2 years back and it does all that I need, Yet the lure of a better screen and CPU chip finally enticed me. I also welcome the Bluetooth 5 for earbuds and the lightness of the overall unit.As others have mentioned, the battery life when using the quality screen settings are a little below four hours, weak compared to the Asus Flip, with almost better specs- but the Flip doesn't have the quality screen this unit does. (I'm not carrying a charger with me when a battery pack will do the job.)The added functionality of Android apps, which are not always available with other brands, make this Galaxy a winner. Besides, I am a Samsung fan. At $800. this is a worthy contender to Best Chromebook of 2020.

  Early impressions - Impossibly thin. Android apps are surprisingly better than web app variants. Red is the laptop color I never knew I needed. The keyboard travel and ""thud"" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.

  I got the white screen saying that ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged."" I tried installing chrome again. I restarted it. I called Samsung support and was on the phone for over two hours just for them to tell me that I'll have to send it in. I sent it the next day ($18 just to ship it), and they told me today that it was broken and they would have to send me a replacement. Fingers crossed that it goes well and they'll keep their word.The computer itself is very nice, but the software is buggy. I don't like Apple products but now I'm considering switching over. :(

  Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments.

   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit.

  The computer arrived for the first package, and it was in a good condition externally. There was no damage, and everything seemed pretty new. However, the trackpad and half of the keyboard did not work. Just like the water damage, the right side did not work at all. so I sent it back to the company and received the 2nd package. Trackpad and keyboard work perfectly fine, with all the ports working great. But it has so many scratches and dents. Either way, now I am using this computer, and it is not a solid state drive, it was a 500GB flash drive. I don't know why but the ""update"" does not work on this computer, so I am kind of lost and trying to figure it out. The tech support definitely knows what they are doing and really appreciate being nice to provide the package in quick time fashion and willing to contact customers.

  I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer.

  I ordered this laptop to replace mine after it was stolen. To be honest, This early 2015 model style is my favorite because it is the last time Apple left the assortment of attachments on their laptop. Having access to two USB 3 connections, HDMI, SD, and two thunderbolt connections are really handy for connectivity and losing them to get a newer model didn't seem like something I wanted to do.Having read the description and the reviews, some of which were claiming that this really was an Apple refurbished product I decided to take a chance. With my previous knowledge of the product, I was extremely disappointed in many things.1. Upon receiving the product there was no documentation included in the slightly damaged box. To ship the computer a white, unmarked cardboard box was lightly padded with bubble wrap and a thin sheet of white foam for protection. This box had been placed in a plastic shipping bag. I fell there was quite a good chance that in transit this computer could easily have been damaged.2. When I opened the box I realized there was no documentation. This lack of printed material inside only raised my speculation as to the shotty workmanship that may have gone into the renewal of the product. Without paperwork showing who did the work and whom to contact if there were issues, it seemed as if those who had done the work were not exactly pleased with their own workmanship.3. Although the laptop was clean it was not in a separate plastic bag to ensure it would not get scratched during shipment. The computer was merely placed among the packing material inside the box.4. Looking at the overall appearance of the laptop it seemed appropriate though it seemed as if the fine finishing Apple does to the outer metal shell was not correct. The edges are always crisp and smooth where there appeared to be rougher. I also noted, as visible in the image provided, that there was no tag on the bottom. Apple places a tag on the bottom of their cases with information including the model number. This number is used by several third-party companies that provide aftermarket items such as cases for their products. It also authenticates the product as being a genuine Apple product. With this missing, I feel there is an excellent chance that the bottom case had to be replaced in the refurbishing process leaving me to believe that hardware on the inside might have needed to be replaced.5. Once I turned the computer on I noticed some other details. The first is that whoever had set up the interface assumed you were using Xfinity as an internet provider. I was also extremely disappointed in this interface because of how generic it was, again not giving away any details as to who had done the renewal and giving rise to even more suspicion as to the quality of the product I had received.6; Having previously had the exact same model previously for several years I can attest that it is slightly slower than the one I had previously, the internet, as well as applications, do not respond with the same robustness as I would expect.So, this all boils down to, a consumer, I should have been more careful. I should have read the return policy more carefully noting that it did not have the normal 30-day return policy and that there would most certainly be a restocking fee if sent back. I should have thought through the fact that the renewal process may result in the cheapening of the quality generally associated with Apple products and that the parts used to restore the laptop to its original condition may not be on par with what Apple originally used.  I the future I will only buy Apple Certified Refurbished computers and not trust Amazon Renewed products to be up to snuff.

  I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition.

  I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel.

  This experience has been great so far. My laptop arrived quickly. Set up was simple. This is my first Lenovo and so far it has exceeded my expectations and one the best laptops I have had. I especially like the keyboard; it is very comfortable to use. Only feature not a 5 is the display which seems faded and murky but I am accustomed to using gaming laptops so that may account for it. So far, so good. I have had it for 2 weeks.

  Great laptop for home use and home office. Packed with features, ram and disk are amazing. Not for serious gaming though.

  I just received this computer and it is garbage.  I couldn’t even get it set up before it encountered an error and had to restart.  After it restarted it ran for about three minutes and ran into another error and restarted.  As of now, I’ve had it on for about 15 minutes and it has run into errors and restarted four times.  I thought Apple was the worst computer I’d ever known but, now I’m missing the days when I had an Apple computer that only froze up occasionally.

  Just bought this laptop. Everything seems to be working properly except the fingerprint scanner.After many hours, I have tried everything (activated the bitlocker, made sure the BIOS security chip was active, etc.) but the Windows system still cannot ""find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Finger"".I wish the support team could provide some assistance to make this work. This was the primary feature I that made me choose this laptop over other laptops and it doesn't work.

  I had an HP Pavillion previously which was ok, but this ThinkPad has 2 times the battery life (about 6 hrs.) with steady use, more with light use. I have a blog and write a LOT!! The keyboard is much much better than any laptop I have ever owned. The keys are ""cupped"" just enough and are perfectly responsive for me. The screen is easier to see because there is no glare and the colors are vibrant. As you can tell, I love it!!

  I bought this laptop for use in my new home-based business. My old computer was slow. This one is amazingly fast, and I love that it has Windows 10 Pro. I have seen this same computer listed at Walmart for $1500, and this computer has everything I need. Setup and update was the fastest and easiest I have ever experienced on any computer.I have only had this for a few days, so I'm sure I will discover even more features as time goes by, but for now, here are my favorite things about this computer.<ul><li>It works flawlessly with a second monitor hooked up to it</li><li>It has a 10-key option built into the keyboard. If you hold down the Fn button on the left side of the keyboard, you can use the 10-key function with your right hand. I thought about attaching a second keyboard to this so I would have 10-key, but now I don't have to. </li><li>The power cord plugs into the back instead of into the side, which just works out better for me. </li><li>This computer is lightning fast. I can have 10 or more open tabs on my web browser, and it doesn't slow down a bit! </li><li>I don't know what it is about it, but the touchpad just feels nicer and seems easier to use. The surface of the touch pad and the area around it is textured. Maybe this is what makes it easier. Also, the buttons are where you can see them, rather than hidden within the touch pad. </li><li>Mine does have a backlit keyboard, but do be aware that this is a luck-of-the-draw feature. Not all of these will have that. </li><li>The battery life seems to be really long. I have not used it away from my desk much, but during the few times that I have left it unplugged for a few hours, I noticed very little drain on the battery compared to my old laptop.</li><li>The picture is very high-quality. I have a second monitor hooked up to it, which is also brand new, and other than the monitor being larger, I do not discern any difference in the picture quality.</li></ul>I will say it would have been nice if it had a touch-screen, but with all this laptop's good features and qualities, I adapted very quickly to not having a touchscreen.I am sure there are a lot of other things to love about this laptop, which I will discover over time. I will keep updating this review as I find more awesome features. I was a little nervous about getting a refurbished computer, but I am so glad I did. I never could have gotten this caliber of a computer within my budget, and it is what I needed. This is the best investment I have made into my new business so far.I use this computer for office and business-related tasks. I put it through a pretty good load with a lot of multitasking during use, in ways my old laptop could not tolerate. It seems to have the resources to handle everything I throw at it. I was thinking I would just buy a lower-cost laptop for now, then get a more expensive one once I get my business off the ground, but this one is a keeper!I do not know how this would perform for gaming, as I am not a gamer and have never tried any gaming. I just know it has everything I wanted in a laptop for business needs. If you need a computer for work or just for general everyday use, I highly recommend this one.

  So very frustrating to get the whole system set up only to find that every time I shut the lid and it went to sleep upon opening the wifi would not automatically start up. Spent 3 days researching and troubleshooting only to end up on the phone w/ Dell tech who after 3 hours of trying could not resolve the issue. They wanted to send a tech out to replace the hard drive. So happy I bought this through Amazon as the rep stuck w/ me through the call w/ Dell (who wanted to charge me to troubleshoot!!!) and agreed to refund my money promptly.

  We were highly disappointed..no activated OS and DELL said the laptop was 3 years old and out of warranty. To fix the OS would cost us more money but DELL was willing to fix the problem. The laptop was a gift for my daughter,all wrapped up with a bow. What a disappointment to see it had no OPerating System ACTIVATED and we were NOT given the activation key for the product. Microsoft also couldn’t help us so we are returning the defective equipment to PRIMETIME. Also PRIMETIME(Company who sold us the laptop)  IS A DECEITFUL name, we thought it was amazon prime so we ordered it. The name primetime is NOT An Amazon fulfilled company. However, they did say they will refund my money but it will be over 10 days.

  Battery was dead and fan wasn’t working when I received. Amazon agreed to refund but I had to ship the unit back which would cost me 200$  And they were willing to refund only 50$ for postage. Product look all fine from outside.

  The laptop is fast, the screen is mediocre, the WiFi sucks. The Intel chip powering WiFi functions crashes periodically and you either need to reboot the machine (on Windows for example) or force a PCI rescan (thankfully it's easy on Linux) to get connectivity back. Forget about a long download. I ended up getting a Tp-Link TL-WN725N to use as a WiFi adapter.

  The laptop didn’t work out for us. We had issues where the keyboard and mouse pad would randomly stop working. I think we had the laptop about a month and it happened a few times. When it happened again a few days before the return window would close, I decided we better return it. Since we got this for my daughter to do online schooling due to COVID-19, we needed a functioning laptop ASAP and didn’t really have the time to work with the seller to figure out the issue.  So, we just bought a new laptop at Costco and returned this one. I still gave 4 stars because my money was refunded promptly, no questions asked. Also, I knew buying a renewed laptop can be a gamble...you might get a lemon, but you also might get a great laptop for a great price. We took the gamble and it didn’t work out for us, but as long as we were able to get our money back and the issue was handled appropriately, which I believe it was, all is good.

  Extremely pleased that this is just what I suspected: the new Lenovo Chromebook 3 that came out this year! Mine was made in April 2020. Absolutely love the Lenovo quality. Happy to get my hands on one of these as they're all sold out at the big box stores that starts with W who is the sole provider of new ones. I feel lucky. The Celeron N4020 is better than the Celerons in basically all other Chromebooks and this screen (not a touch screen) is 30+ nits brighter than anything on this price range ($169 MSRP). This is for an elementary school student but I wish I had one as well. No squishy keyboards like the Acer I tried, solidly built, and speakers sound better than the Dell 11 and HP Chromebooks I've had the pleasure of using. I highly recommend watching some popular YouTube videos about this machine if you're considering it. I think it's gonna be the best budget Chromebook yet. The plastic is a fingerprint magnet, other than that it's great. Perfect for email, googling, schoolwork, YouTube, and light online games that a youngster can enjoy. My seller was ShopAmerica and this came looking basically new in a Lenovo factory refurbished box with a Lenovo charger. Would purchase again if I had the money, I'd love a second one. Excited to put this one through it's paces. Thank you.

  This Chromebook replaces a Windows 10 laptop which was never quite right. Chromebook is much better for my wife because security and lack of updating or virus protection is paramount. She just uses it and it is blazing fast.  Newest Chrombook software does much more intuitively than ever before. Truly plug & play!

  This is a solid chromebook, very reliable, good function, no major issues. It works just as well as a brand new unit. Recommended, 5 stars.Pros: ChromeOS up to date; fast startup, good picture, reliable operation; adequate connectivity options (USB, USB-C, Bluetooth); fast wi-fi connectivity; reasonably priced extended warranty options; connnecting an external (2nd) monitor possible, e.g. Pixel PX160 via USB-C port; solidly built without being too bulky.Cons: no HDMI port; additional USB and USB-C ports (one more of each) would be a plus. No major negatives which would amount to a full star deduction.

  I was really impressed with the packaging the refurbished Chromebook came in. The box was the Lenovo product box, but the actual chromebook came in a tight and thick bubble envelope. The actual laptop looked new, with no scratches or blemishes that I could see. It arrived fully charged and ready to be setup. It boots up quickly and easy to use. I got it so my son could use it for distance learning, and I was a little apprehensive about the 720p camera, but the quality and resolution are good enough for what it was meant for. Very satisfied with my purchase.

  Tracking number remained at sellers address until the delivery date which is when I reached out for an update. I never reached a reply but the next day I received the Chromebook which was good until I plugged it in and tried to power it on without success. As an IT professional, I troubleshooted the device with different cables and the Chromebook remained dead and unable to power on. I promptly returned the DOA device that was needed for my middle schooler for virtual school. Unfortunately I will be shopping with other Amazon vendors.

  I acquired this computer without much pretense: to have a light equipment in which I could do tests and take them anywhere without fear that it would suffer some damage and it would be a great loss. However, I was surprised that for the price paid the benefits it gives are more than enough: a good battery gives, a performance enough to handle several open tabs and some Android applications at the same time. The keyboard is decent with a good travel and size.Although the screen is TN, it allows working with acceptable levels of brightness as well as the mouse pad (although I recommend an external mouse). For $ 169 paid on Amazon, there is not a device that has these features including a good range of ports (2 USB A / 2 USB-C / MicroSD / 3.5 mm headphone port). It does not feel weak and has a pleasant texture to the touch, perhaps a coverage that does not grease so easily with the fingers would have been desirable and more storage space (32GB). It also has support included until 2026 which guarantees a great investmentESPAÑOLAdquirí este computador sin muchas pretensiones: tener un equipo ligero en el que pudiera hacer pruebas y llevarlos a cualquier lugar sin temer que fuera a sufrir algún daño y fuera una gran pérdida. Sin embargo, me sorprendió que para el precio pagado las prestaciones que da son más que suficientes: una buena batería, da un rendimiento suficiente para manejar varias pestañas abierta y algunas aplicaciones Android. El teclado es decente con un buen recorrido y tamaño y es lo suficientemente ligero para poderlo llevar a todas partes.Si bien la pantalla es TN  -lástima que no sea IPS- permite trabajar con unos niveles de brillo aceptables al igual que la almohadilla del mouse (aunque recomiendo un mouse externo). Por $169 pagados en Amazon (incluido el envío gratuito a Colombia!) no hay un equipo que tenga estas prestaciones incluyendo una buena oferta de puertos (2 USB-A / 2 USB-C / MicroSD / puerto de audífonos 3.5 mm). No se siente frágil y tiene una textura al tacto agradable, tal vez hubiera sido deseable una cobertura que no se engrase tan fácil con los dedos y mayor almacenamiento. Finalmente, promete un soporte AUE hasta 2026 lo cual garantiza una buena inversión.

  Pathetic. The laptop was sent to me with someone else's information on it. Their email address was still logged in and the system already had issues where administrator couldn't be changed and just didn't work.

  Processor is very powerful considering its price being relatively low, 8 gb ram is sufficient for most tasks, and the gtx 1650 is excellent for gaming with most games. The only problem with it is its low storage space of only 256 gb ssd, but that can be solved with other means.

  Just full disclosure....I did not buy from this seller. But I bought one private sale brand new for about the same price. My old basic HP laptop couldn't handle much for gaming. This blows any other laptop I've personally used out of the water. I can actually play my online Starcraft games on the highest graphics settings with zero lag or any problems. Battery life could be better but that's my only gripe. Ryzen cpu is noticably faster and smoother than Intel without a doubt. If you find one of these for under $800 it's a great deal!

  I had this shipped to the Philippines so my brother can use it. Laptop is great, fast and my brother loves it. But the thing is, he found a broken part on the laptop, so I went ahead and contact HP and Amazon about it. After going back and forth with HP, HP basically told me that in order for them to fix the laptop, it needs to be sent back to the US. I pointed out that they have global coverage and shipping back to the US would be more expensive than the fix itself. But they told me that since the model is not being sold in the Philippines, they couldn’t fix it in the Philippines. This is the biggest reason why I picked this product because of the promise of global coverage. But nope, not true. Amazon support was great and was very willing to help me out. They were even willing to pay for the shipping return label that we will have to spend. But after all the costs that would be needed to pay for shipping and customs, I still would have to pay at least $200 more than the real cost of the product so my brother decided to keep it.

  I see a lot of people mentioning the appearance of the laptop and rating it on that, which I don't think is a great way to review anything honestly.This machine does everything that it is supposed to do flawlessly. It obviously runs Chrome OS, which if you aren't sure what that means doesn't mean you should 1 star it.I''m currently about halfway through a MFA degree and this is a great machine to get my school work done. On top of that, I've taken this laptop hiking several times already and there isn't so much as an unsightly dent.Moreover, the actual aesthetic design isn't as childish looking as the thumbnail photo suggests. I am a working professional and I have zero qualms about being seen with this laptop. This is rapidly becoming my go to system, outside of my actual tower of course. And I mean, look at that price.'Nuff said

  Bought 3 of these ChromeBooks for business purposes. Now I know these were used, but they definently were not ""Renewed"". Two of them could definently pass as being renewed if not for being slightly dirty. The third one on the other hand has more than slight cosmetic damage, and it it obvious that it will no longer be as rugged as the C202SA's are supposed to be as the gap in the casing is hard to miss. Used to work for a company that rebuilt laptops and this would have been parted out and not aloud to be sold. Reviewed all the different ""Amazon Renewed"" for best ratings. But the one was anything but renewed so be wairy if you plan to buy they are just reset not renewed.

  Got two of these for my kids. The 180-degree screen hinge is perfect. The computer battery life is insanely long! they do homework on them and the batteries last several days without recharging.

  LOVE the fact that it has TWO USB 3.0 ports AND HDMI AND SD Card Slot.  In some ways it's better than my $700 laptop.  I keep movies and music on an SD card and use the USB slots for everything else.  I hooked up HDMI once and didn't explore it for very long but it looks like it is like a laptop, you can set the external screen for primary or secondary or you can clone them. Using apps from Google Play market means that you can handle PowerPoint, Word, and more even though this is not a laptop.Battery does last a looong time as others have said.Screen:  Lots of settings to optimize for your preference.  It's an 11.6"" diagonal screen with a maximum resolution of 1518x953 but if you want words to be bigger you can reduce the resolution all the way to 911x512.  Many web designers assume your screen is at least 600 pixels high and if you choose 911x512 mode you'll need to scroll (2 fingers) down to see the typical home page login screen.The other character size adjustment you have is in the browser.  So set the device for what you want your apps to look like and then set the browser for what you want web pages to look like.  On Chrome, that's CTRL  with  + or -  (or use the settings).If you're used to a tablet or phone, there is no pinch to zoom in or out.  That can be done as above, with settings on either the device or the web browser.Keyboard:  I found it to be comfortable and responsive.  Nice touch to it, and not noisy.  It's a little hard to see blue letters on black keys at night, but as there are TWO USB ports I may buy myself a little USB light to travel with.Puts out plenty of sound for personal use, or, of course, you can use headsets.Internet:  Having both 2Ghz and 5Ghz means you can connect pretty much anywhere.  I was having trouble with my older tablet and phone whenever I got hired by Google to do a day of work for them because they are moving away from the 2Ghz band, so this flexible baby solves that problem.ASUS:  Have been using their products for years.  They are reliable and responsive.Been one month.  So far I love it.  If that changes ... I'll update.  :)

  I run a business where my software is web-based and I use Google drive for a lot of personal and shared documents.  This is the perfect size to throw in my bag on the go, as well as put in some good writing time at home.  I love the sturdy keyboard and the rugged exterior.  I previously had an old probably first generation Samsung Chromebook - I loved the size and used it for many years, but the power cord got bent inside the computer so I needed a replacement.  I like this unit so much better.  I'm ecstatic about this little guy!

  As a sub for a larger more powerful computer.  Its as efficient as the larger computer, it just has a smaller screen.  Did not rate the sound quality as I don't use it.

  Seems like a reliable machine so far. Snappy startup. Worth the price for a first chromebook. Looks more durable than average, but rugged may not be accurate. I don’t feel like testing the durability currently though.

  I love using the Paprika app to manage recipes, meal plans, and shopping lists. Cooking is a huge hobby for me, and it's so nice to have a ruggedized lappy in the kitchen. It's quick and responsive, and when I spilled water on it last night, everything was just fine.

  I wanted a  laotop that can do anything wherever I go. I mainly bought it for work to edit videos and to play some games if I wanted to.  I have the 16gb ram version and I was worried.  I had YouTube playing a high quality video with discord video chat going on And Call of Duty warzone playing at the same time. I was very impressed with its performance!  Played for 3 hours straight No problems whatsoever!  My ram was hovering around 3 to 4GB. Still plenty of Room to do other things🙏  I ended up buying the matching mouse and headset which is a MUST if you're  going to play. I'm thinking about getting the monitor  next!  If you don't go this route make sure you purchase a cooling pad. It makes a night and day difference!  This computer will run hot. You can adjust settings to cool it down a little but the cooling pad will take care of the heating.  I also but the Alienware bag/ case. It's a very snug fit which I like but in the long run you will end up scratching the tip/corner from the zipper. 🤷  Overall I highly recommend this computer to anyone!  It's super fast and the screen is amazing!  If you are worried about 16 gigs of ram. Don't.  IT WILL HANDLE IT EASY! Hope this review helped! 🤙

  The Alienware m15 R4 is an excellent choice for gaming on the go or in the event that you are unable to acquire the necessary parts for a tower pc at retail prices. This particular laptop comes with high end parts meant to last and provide superior gaming experiences. Overall a great choice for the price, considering this is for a laptop, so the convenience and portability in mind makes it a great reason to purchase if you're an avid gamer. I do recommend buying a cooling mat or external cooling pad because the laptop runs a bit hot due to its compact design. The battery life lasted me around 4-5 hours when I was watching Netflix in FHD and playing games like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and CoD: Warzone.

  Alienware m17 R4, 17.3 inch Non-Touch Gaming Laptop. This is for the version with 16GB of RAM, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6, and the Intel Core i7-10870HInitial Review April 24, 2021I think of the consumer laptop market in three categories.1) Low priced, slow, good for social networking, document creation, spreadsheets, photo editing, not for gaming.2) Middle of the spectrum reasonably fast, light, thin, long battery life, quiet. A good practical computer that may be used for some gaming, photo and video editing.3) Powerful, gaming, large, heavy, hot, noisy, expandable, short battery life. This 17"" Alienware clearly falls in the last category. This computer might also be a good choice for heavy video editingThis laptop can handle the most challenging game programs. It isn't the very top of the line but it is up there with the rest. You can order upgraded versions which have more RAM, faster processors, and faster GPUs. You decide. For me this is more than I need.This laptop is so powerful it nearly equals my fairly powerful desktop. My desktop also has an 8 core Intel core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, SSDs, and a decent Graphics Processor Unit. The advantage of this laptop is it takes up much less space than a desktop in a portable package.The first thing I did with this Alienware laptop after going through the typical Windows 10 setup was to download the 170GB of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 files. That program self adjusts to the capability of the hardware. On my desktop most of the MFS2020 parameters are set to HIGH and this laptop proved to be fast enough that the program also set the parameters to HIGH with a frame rate of  60fps. We have five laptops in the house and this is the only one that can handle graphics intensive programs like MFS2020.Pros:- A very powerful GPU with 6GB of local RAM. This isn't Nvidia's fastest GPU but it is right up there close to the top performers. It is the latest class of GPU engines in the $400 range for the GPU alone. By the way this same laptop can be ordered with higher performing GPUs with options for larger local RAM.- Running graphics intensive games will generate a lot of heat. Alienware includes quite a bit of information regarding the cooling technology in this laptop. That helps account for the weight (over 5 pounds) and I suppose the thickness of this laptop.- Cooling and Noise. While the fans seem to run most of the time the sound is smooth, not raspy. I don't find it offensive.- Intel Core i7-10870H 10th generation. Several things come together to make a fast gaming computer. One is the CPU, then there is the M2 fast SSD, the GPU, BUSS interfaces, and the bulk storage SSD. I find that the bulk of the task is given to the GPU which is where we should spend the most of our money. The CPU can certainly be a bottleneck if it is too slow but this one is fast. It's not the fastest Intel i7 but it doesn't need to be due to the GPU taking over the major tasks. It is listed as HIGH END by cpubenchmark.net.- WiFi 6. It turns out my new router is WiFi 6 capable so this is the first hardware that can actually use that faster WiFi system. If you have a fast internet service the next bottleneck would be the wireless connection to the gaming laptop. WiFi 6 is significantly faster than all previous WiFi generations.- Bluetooth included. My desktop does not have Bluetooth so I've had to use a dongle for that feature. It is nice not to burn a USB port for that function.- 16GB of RAM. My desktop has 32GB but I've found the computer really doesn't run that much faster with the extra 16GB of RAM. I'm not planning to upgrade the RAM.- Integrated front camera and microphone- A decent keyboard that is thankfully backlit.- Speakers that actually sound quite good for a laptop. While gaming I normally use earphones.- Thunderbolt/USB-C. Not only does this single port handle the USB-C interface but can handle Thunderbolt speeds. Very fast.- Thunderbolt. You can actually purchase available external GPUs which could connect to this laptop through the Thunderbolt connector.- The keyboard surface is plastic, feels good, not a fingerprint magnet. With a laptop of this large size the keyboard can be full-sized.- It's a nice looking laptop with keyboard backlit color variations and other accents on the case.Cons:- If you're looking for the top of the line fastest gaming laptop you might want to check out the other options available for this laptop including more RAM, better GPUs, and a faster CPU.- Short battery life. about 2 hours. You must bring the AC power brick along.- The 240Watt AC power brick is huge and heavy at 9"" x 4"" x 1""- Expensive. So are most gaming laptops but this one seems to be about 10% higher.- Can't upgrade RAM? Stuck at 16GB due to RAM soldered on motherboard. I have not opened the back to check this fact. I've seen conflicting comments on-line about upgrading the RAM. Some say there are two RAM slots.Things I wish this laptop had. I knew these when I ordered this computer so they are not part of my review in terms of star ratings. I just wanted others to know about some features I consider pretty standard these days that this laptop does not have.- A touch screen. This is pretty much a standard these days with laptops, tablets, phones, and even desktops. I just don't get it and it is one of the things I miss the most.- A keyboard minus the 10-key. I don't use the 10-key and it causes the main part of the keyboard to be off center of the screen.Do I recommend this laptop? Actually my suggestion is if you really want the best graphics I strongly suggest you do buy this laptop but in the other version which has a faster CPU, more RAM, and a faster GPU.

   This detachable magnetic keyboard two-in-one tablet computer is adorable in that it is so much smaller than any other laptop that I’ve owned. This Haobook106 has Micro USB port, USB3.0 port, HDMI port, DC jack, earphone jack, mic and TF card slot. It has a super thin 1280x800 IPS 10 inch high-definition touch screen display that works so effortlessly! Some of the specs are it has a 2GB RAM, 32GB of storage when support of TF card slot which can expand the storage up to 512GB! It has a very decent Camera 0.3MP+2.0MP (front and back camera). The battery is 6000mah and lasts me for days because it works so well.  The Operating system is Windows 10 which works like a charm on this device.My favorite aspect of this product is the detachable magnetic screen. It comes off so easily and quickly becomes a tablet for convenience of doing many things, but then it can fold up and be put away with added protection unlike most tablets that are exposed.I have a lot of future use in this product and look forward to experiencing it’s full potential. I would highly recommend this for a college student or for someone who likes and appreciates the multifunctional tablet to laptop capabilities. You must stay aware so that you do not pick it up by the screen because or disconnects so easily, which is a huge part of what I love about it. Just be aware.

  I ordered 2 of these tablet/laptops for my kids for Christmas. I was looking for a Windows based machine as the Google Chromebooks can't do some of the online games that they like. So, I researched and this one came up with pretty good reviews. It was a nightmare! First, just getting it set up was a pain but we got through all that and got the kids going. However, even though they weren't doing anything with major graphics or anything, the machines were SUPER slow. I have good internet and use multiple devices on it without this issue, so it isn't that. It was only slow on these machines. Additionally, it was so slow that many things wouldn't load or function at all. Really, just didn't have the capacity to do much of anything. I asked the kids and so now the laptops are on their way back in (For a $43 restocking fee per laptop btw). Cost me $86 for useless machines. Will never do again!

  We purchased this as an extra tablet to use with our label printer for our ecommerce business.  The sole use of this computer was to use the internet to generate shipping labels and then print the labels.  It stopped connecting to the internet after about 6 weeks and stopped connecting to the label printer (via USB) after about 7 weeks.  Extremely slow.  Honestly very painful to use especially considering we were only using it for one purpose.

  It stopped working and it over heats. The ROM and RAM is too low, and it frequently hangs. It’s keyboard is so small and gets jammed after 10 days or using it. I would rather go buy an acer or chrome book which costs the same price, rather than buying this China useless product

  Don’t buy it!  If you do, be very careful when opening it in “laptop” mode.  The tablet/top portion has 2 flimsy plastic tabs and one of them broke the 3rd time we used it.  Because one of the tabs broke, the top portion will not connect to the bottom/keyboard portion.  As such, it is useless.

  So I open it up and hold down the power button before plugging it in since that's when I opened the direction packet.The screen with the logo on it for the brand comes up and WONT UNFREEZE.I had bought it brand new and this is the second laptop in a week I'm going to have to return.Why Is this so difficult!?!?!?!?

2,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"" Laptop, 15.6"" HD (1366 x 768) Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 128GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics, Windows 10, 81W10094US, Business Black",$359.99,3.0,"
  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it! Shipping was very fast, and the customer service I received from HALF TIME was executive level. I would recommend this machine for anyone doing lite gaming, or any schoolwork.

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install. Everything is working as intended. I would recommend This Laptop. I like the auto on feature and the 4 digit pin login, makes it easy to get to work.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

2,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Windows Tablet 10in, Ultra Slim Windows 10 Tablet PC - 4GB RAM 64GB Storage, 5MP and 2MP Cameras, 1280x800 IPS HD Display, Black",$240.59,2.0,"
  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  I wanted a  laotop that can do anything wherever I go. I mainly bought it for work to edit videos and to play some games if I wanted to.  I have the 16gb ram version and I was worried.  I had YouTube playing a high quality video with discord video chat going on And Call of Duty warzone playing at the same time. I was very impressed with its performance!  Played for 3 hours straight No problems whatsoever!  My ram was hovering around 3 to 4GB. Still plenty of Room to do other things🙏  I ended up buying the matching mouse and headset which is a MUST if you're  going to play. I'm thinking about getting the monitor  next!  If you don't go this route make sure you purchase a cooling pad. It makes a night and day difference!  This computer will run hot. You can adjust settings to cool it down a little but the cooling pad will take care of the heating.  I also but the Alienware bag/ case. It's a very snug fit which I like but in the long run you will end up scratching the tip/corner from the zipper. 🤷  Overall I highly recommend this computer to anyone!  It's super fast and the screen is amazing!  If you are worried about 16 gigs of ram. Don't.  IT WILL HANDLE IT EASY! Hope this review helped! 🤙

  The Alienware m15 R4 is an excellent choice for gaming on the go or in the event that you are unable to acquire the necessary parts for a tower pc at retail prices. This particular laptop comes with high end parts meant to last and provide superior gaming experiences. Overall a great choice for the price, considering this is for a laptop, so the convenience and portability in mind makes it a great reason to purchase if you're an avid gamer. I do recommend buying a cooling mat or external cooling pad because the laptop runs a bit hot due to its compact design. The battery life lasted me around 4-5 hours when I was watching Netflix in FHD and playing games like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and CoD: Warzone.

  Alienware m17 R4, 17.3 inch Non-Touch Gaming Laptop. This is for the version with 16GB of RAM, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6, and the Intel Core i7-10870HInitial Review April 24, 2021I think of the consumer laptop market in three categories.1) Low priced, slow, good for social networking, document creation, spreadsheets, photo editing, not for gaming.2) Middle of the spectrum reasonably fast, light, thin, long battery life, quiet. A good practical computer that may be used for some gaming, photo and video editing.3) Powerful, gaming, large, heavy, hot, noisy, expandable, short battery life. This 17"" Alienware clearly falls in the last category. This computer might also be a good choice for heavy video editingThis laptop can handle the most challenging game programs. It isn't the very top of the line but it is up there with the rest. You can order upgraded versions which have more RAM, faster processors, and faster GPUs. You decide. For me this is more than I need.This laptop is so powerful it nearly equals my fairly powerful desktop. My desktop also has an 8 core Intel core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, SSDs, and a decent Graphics Processor Unit. The advantage of this laptop is it takes up much less space than a desktop in a portable package.The first thing I did with this Alienware laptop after going through the typical Windows 10 setup was to download the 170GB of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 files. That program self adjusts to the capability of the hardware. On my desktop most of the MFS2020 parameters are set to HIGH and this laptop proved to be fast enough that the program also set the parameters to HIGH with a frame rate of  60fps. We have five laptops in the house and this is the only one that can handle graphics intensive programs like MFS2020.Pros:- A very powerful GPU with 6GB of local RAM. This isn't Nvidia's fastest GPU but it is right up there close to the top performers. It is the latest class of GPU engines in the $400 range for the GPU alone. By the way this same laptop can be ordered with higher performing GPUs with options for larger local RAM.- Running graphics intensive games will generate a lot of heat. Alienware includes quite a bit of information regarding the cooling technology in this laptop. That helps account for the weight (over 5 pounds) and I suppose the thickness of this laptop.- Cooling and Noise. While the fans seem to run most of the time the sound is smooth, not raspy. I don't find it offensive.- Intel Core i7-10870H 10th generation. Several things come together to make a fast gaming computer. One is the CPU, then there is the M2 fast SSD, the GPU, BUSS interfaces, and the bulk storage SSD. I find that the bulk of the task is given to the GPU which is where we should spend the most of our money. The CPU can certainly be a bottleneck if it is too slow but this one is fast. It's not the fastest Intel i7 but it doesn't need to be due to the GPU taking over the major tasks. It is listed as HIGH END by cpubenchmark.net.- WiFi 6. It turns out my new router is WiFi 6 capable so this is the first hardware that can actually use that faster WiFi system. If you have a fast internet service the next bottleneck would be the wireless connection to the gaming laptop. WiFi 6 is significantly faster than all previous WiFi generations.- Bluetooth included. My desktop does not have Bluetooth so I've had to use a dongle for that feature. It is nice not to burn a USB port for that function.- 16GB of RAM. My desktop has 32GB but I've found the computer really doesn't run that much faster with the extra 16GB of RAM. I'm not planning to upgrade the RAM.- Integrated front camera and microphone- A decent keyboard that is thankfully backlit.- Speakers that actually sound quite good for a laptop. While gaming I normally use earphones.- Thunderbolt/USB-C. Not only does this single port handle the USB-C interface but can handle Thunderbolt speeds. Very fast.- Thunderbolt. You can actually purchase available external GPUs which could connect to this laptop through the Thunderbolt connector.- The keyboard surface is plastic, feels good, not a fingerprint magnet. With a laptop of this large size the keyboard can be full-sized.- It's a nice looking laptop with keyboard backlit color variations and other accents on the case.Cons:- If you're looking for the top of the line fastest gaming laptop you might want to check out the other options available for this laptop including more RAM, better GPUs, and a faster CPU.- Short battery life. about 2 hours. You must bring the AC power brick along.- The 240Watt AC power brick is huge and heavy at 9"" x 4"" x 1""- Expensive. So are most gaming laptops but this one seems to be about 10% higher.- Can't upgrade RAM? Stuck at 16GB due to RAM soldered on motherboard. I have not opened the back to check this fact. I've seen conflicting comments on-line about upgrading the RAM. Some say there are two RAM slots.Things I wish this laptop had. I knew these when I ordered this computer so they are not part of my review in terms of star ratings. I just wanted others to know about some features I consider pretty standard these days that this laptop does not have.- A touch screen. This is pretty much a standard these days with laptops, tablets, phones, and even desktops. I just don't get it and it is one of the things I miss the most.- A keyboard minus the 10-key. I don't use the 10-key and it causes the main part of the keyboard to be off center of the screen.Do I recommend this laptop? Actually my suggestion is if you really want the best graphics I strongly suggest you do buy this laptop but in the other version which has a faster CPU, more RAM, and a faster GPU.

  I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!

  Wow. I cant say enough how happy I am with this laptop! I it arrived early, and for a refurbished computer I swear it doesn't have a scratch, dent, smudge or single flaw anywhere on it! Its fast, the battery is great, its working perfectly! I couldn't be happier with this thing!

  Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new"".

  I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware.

  I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend.

  Overall, this is an excellent Chromebook. Easy to use right out of the box. But there are a few frustrating design flaws. First, the left shift key was placed an entire row down because for some reason they felt it was necessary to put a random “search” button right where the shift key would go! So if you are an experienced typist, every time you go to make a capital letter, you hit the very disruptive search key and an entire search window opens. It’s beyond annoying and it really makes fluid typing difficult. I would never have purchased it for this one problem!Another design problem is how hard you have to press down on the touchpad in order to perform functions with it, it actually starts to be a big effort.Not looking for things to complain about, but these “little” things have caused me to dread using this machine just a few days in. Far from a smooth use each time!

  I had an Acer 15.6, which I liked quite a bit but I've had it several years and it was starting to rundown.  I then purchased an 11.6 (I think) and I found it to be too small.  Returned it and ordered this.  I love it.  More lightweight that 15.6, fast , screen is beautiful (HD), keyboard is fine.  No complaints at all.  Very, very happy.  Ever since I got my first Chromebook I was sold.

  I really wanted to like this. I bought this thinking Chrome OS would be similar to Windows. It runs more like a phone or tablet. The system is based on a Google/Gmail account (your password/login is your email and your password). This would be great for leisure use but I wanted a work computer. And after I turned it on, I realized I couldn’t install the Microsoft 365 suite for Windows on it. I’d have to go onto Google Play and install each program (i.e. Excel) separately and pay separately. Costing more and doesn’t have good reviews. It may just be too new for other programs like Photoshop to be available for it (I didn’t even look because it was getting to be too much work). Sadly I returned it. I really wanted to like this.If it was just for browsing the web, emails and watching Netflix, it’s a great laptop for that. It’s fast, incredibly light and the screen comes right to the edge, making it very sleek.

  I bought this mainly for my kid to be able to do school stuff - perfect as the school uses chromebooks too, or so I thought. Since I bought it near summer (May 21, 2020) it was only used a handful of times. Yesterday (August 3,2020) we needed to use it and it was dead. As in, nothing. No power button light, trying to charge it no light, wouldn't turn on. NOTHING. There is no damage to the case, screen, etc., so it's not like it was handled roughly. It just won't do anything. I would not recommend this to anyone.

  When my 2015 excellent Toshiba chromebook started to fall apart, I began shopping for a new one. After I read that Chrome only supports chromebook for five years I decided to find an inexpensive one and that led me to the Acer. Functionally, this chromebook can do everything that a chromebook promises, but the quality of the screen is woefully inadequate, and the sound is really underpowered. I find that I have to constantly adjust the tilt of the screen to be able to see the image. And as of yesterday, one of the keys is already sticking. But it will have to do. I won't pay the price to buy an expensive chromebook when the company builds in obsolescence after five years.

Very happy with my purchase.EDIT: After I used the laptop for about a week or so, it started to freezing up which is disappointing, but the customer service from the seller was top notch.  The seller was very quick to respond to my messages and they issued a refund very quickly.  Although the product did not work as expected, I would have no issue buying from this seller again.

  This product came in timely manner, even though it was ordered holiday time. Everything works well besides for 2 issues. I am finding that downloading apps and data goes quickly, but, when more than 4 windows are open, it takes a long time (up to 50 seconds) to load or open a new window. Additionally, the touch screen is NOT touch screen at all. It hasn't worked not once since I bought the product. Either it is a faulty feature or the product sent to me is not the product advertised.

  I just finished ordering this product for the second time after returning the first product. The first LG Gram came to me and was coming up with the blue screen of death immediately. After some communication with the manufacturer and the warehouse that sent it to me, we determined there was nothing to do than to refund it. This is not something that could have been seen by the company I ordered the product from. The product itself is really nice when it worked and I made sure to order the same one hoping that it was just bad luck receiving that product. The company I ordered it from was fantastic throughout and gave me free shipping when I asked about how the shipping process worked. Everything was done in a timely manner and ordered my second computer knowing that I can trust them incase this issue happened again.

  I was skeptical about the specs of the laptop when I bought it but I am more than pleasantly surprised on performance.  Yes it can really use another four gigs of RAM ($20) and will run in dual channel mode, or you can load it up with an eight or 16 gig stick with slightly less performance but more simultaneous applications.  I'm actually more than pleasantly surprised that $150 laptop with a full version of Windows home a free upgrade out of s mode can run everything I throw at it as a semi-power user.  This Intel gold actually has better specs than the entry level i3.  Once you get into the quad 6 and 8 cores yes they do blow this out of the water if you are using power hungry spps.  The LCD is washed out and matte but after adjusting the gamma and contrast it's a little bit better but not great that's probably the biggest knock I have on it.  But it does have an HDMI slot and pushes a pretty good picture and external LCD with a higher quality resolution color spectrum.  The internal m2 disc IO came back on the low side but nowhere near SATA saturation so the disk included is definitely not a bottleneck.  You can add a 2.5 in drive but you'll have to find and buy the right drive caddy and cable from a third party China sealer because lenovo is backward forever.  Yes it's fully plastic chassis and body, one heat pipe, the smaller cavity battery to allow for the 2.5 drive. With a very slight modification and some two-sided tape you can easily fit the jumbo replacement battery in this thing. I can't believe I scored this thing for $154 new from the Mart of walls black Friday sale.

  I had a lot of hope switching from HP to Microsoft.  I thought that getting the top of the line laptop would be faster and have longer battery life.First off the packaging feels a bit flimsy and less durable.  It's definitely lighter from the HP 360 spectre I had, but it comes at a cost.My HP spectre was 10 years old intel i7, 512 gb SSD and 8 gb of ram and was running great, but after 10 years I thought I could use an upgrade.  After setting it up I noticed that it seemed a tick slower even with 24 gb of ram.  So I tested it and found out that the HP fired up faster to the home screen by 20 secs faster!I thought I can live with that if the battery lasted longer.  Guess what?  It doesn't.  I tested it from 100% that I get about 3.75 hours of battery before I have to plug it in.  That seems crazy off of what is stated!  After 10 years my HP matches the battery life.With that said, if you're going to buy a surface for speed and battery life try the AMD processor.  I would still feel a bit skeptical to be honest.I'm truly disappointed.

  The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15"" model is certainly an excellent laptop and an extremely credible alternative to other premium Windows-based laptops, AND MacBook Pros. My current workhorse is the 2019 16"" MacBook Pro, so let's compare the two here, despite there certainly being a price difference.1.) The aluminum chassis is stunning. It's incredibly minimalist. If you think Apple is minimalist with its MacBook line, Microsoft takes it to the next level. A solid mass of black (in this reviewer’s case), and ice cold to the touch.2.) Really lightweight at 3.4lbs, compared to 4.3lbs on the MacBook Pro 16. 2496 x 1664 (201ppi), - though not as good as on the MacBook Pro 16, (3072x1920, 226ppi), - still looks the part. Colors are not as vibrant as the MacBook Pro, only covering 75% DCI-P3 compared to 99% on the MacBook Pro, and the difference is really, really obvious. The display is certainly good, but in 2021 this isn't close to flagship. Throw in a pretty mediocre max screen brightness (380 cd/m2), this isn't great. The MacBook Pro 16"" will hit about 500cd/m2, and the difference side my side is staggering. It is a touch-screen, mind, but I’m still not convinced a touchscreen on a non-convertible laptop has tangible benefit to most users.The auto-brightness setup is very “jagged,” not a smooth fading up or down in brightness, - and I just turned this feature off as I found it very distracting.3.) The trackpad is responsive, though it’s pretty small compared to the MacBook. While I prefer the nice, physical trackpad click on the Surface, the MacBook’s trackpad allows you to “click” anywhere.4.) Port selection is really, really poor here. A single USB Type-A, a single USB Type-C, a headphone jack, and the Surface proprietary charging connector (something that really seems incredibly pointless, especially in 2021). No Thunderbolt ports of any sort here, which is a major oversight. Thankfully you can charge via the USB Type-C port so you don’t have to use the Surface proprietary port if you don’t want to.As an aside, setup of the Surface Laptop 4 is easy. Turn on, run through some initial setup, and you’re done pretty quickly. Bloatware is kept to a complete minimum, and I only found myself removing Microsoft 365 and a few other extraneous apps.5.) The keyboard is good. It’s not the best, a little spongier than the MacBook Pro 16’s, with a slower rebound, but still among the “good” keyboards on the market, - reasonably tactile. It has physical F-keys, something I wish I had on the MacBook Pro 16. I think the TouchBar is one of the worst things to happen to MacBooks (inadvertent touches are the worst!), so I hope Apple reverts to physical keys this coming year on their flagship system. Rumor has it they will.6.) Ergonomics are decent, though it’s actually a bit tricky to open the laptop as there’s no indent where you’re meant to flip the screen up, - a peculiar oversight. Bezels are a little large for 2021, but far from offensive.7.) Sound quality is not bad, but a far cry from the bass that the MacBook Pro 16 is able to generate. You could certainly listen to music here, but headphones would be preferred.8.) Battery life and thermals are absolutely fantastic, decimating the MacBook Pro for general usage, which is just a portable toaster. The laptop just runs remarkably cool with this AMD setup. That said, when the fans kick in, they kick in with a WHOOSH, which can be a bit disconcerting. Battery life is superb, easily giving me 8-11 hours for general web usage, a good 40% longer than my MacBook Pro doing the exact same things at a comparable brightness.  9.) The SSD is nothing too special. While yes, any SSD is faster than not-an-SSD, this is on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of NVMe performance.Overall, I really enjoy the Surface Laptop 4, but it’s not hard to see where Microsoft could make some massive improvements and solidify the Surface line as THE Windows 10 systems to buy.4 out of 5. A worthy alternative to high-end laptops, but not yet at the top of its game.

  I absolutely love my new laptop! I am a loyal HP user, already using the All-in-One touchscreen desktop model, Deskjet 2652 printer, and now my laptop. The camera is amazing and I actually prefer using it for the distance learning Zoom classes for the high school I work for. I also attend college online and this perfect piece of technology will allow me to still vacation with my hubby, even while school is in session. I cannot wait to watch movies on it! Thank you HP!

  Screen is not the best quality. I’m having a hard time opening my hard drive on this laptop. No touchscreen as stated in description. Battery life is very short.

  Only had for a few weeks but so far it’s everything I want. It’s not super thin but not thick either. But feel it is quality and sturdy. As far as the speed it is great. Oh and I love the keyboard. Typing is relaxing and fun on it. As far as everything else’s I am still learning it.

  So far happy with this laptop, it was easy to install and many good new features.  I changed my 6 years old laptop to this new one and what a difference.  It is fast and the keyboard is more user-friendly easier to type on it.  No regrets about this buy and recommend it highly.

  I got the older model, so disappointing seller, even he/she tried prove me it is not wrong item. However the laptop I received despite was older model, has some good features such as great trackpad, excellent keyboard, good sound quality, enough ports, decent build quality and design. I wish the battery life also would be good but I get max 6 hours while browsing and using Office apps even sometimes less. But generally 4/5.

  great price for such a great laptop. i have been using this for the past week or so and it's awesome. it has a little weight to it but is sleek and compact so it's easily portable. no issues with touch screen, though i don't use it much since mainly use this for laying in bed and web browsing. but when scrolling through instagram the pics swiped like butter. screen res is amazing. bright, deep colors. and the best part the keyboard is back lit. making it easy to use in the dark. the sound on this is great. it's very loud since it's a whole sound bar. i am glad i was able to buy this laptop.

  This laptop is perfect for remote teaching.  The touchscreen works perfectly.  It does everything I need it to.  My only issue is the single USB port is on the left and I’m right handed.  So when I plug in my mouse, the cord has to go around the back leaving me little cord length.

  Nothing much to complain about really. It's good. Just felt suspicuous about it. Like it felt like someone was trying to track where the computer went or something. The blue tooth was left on and the laptop turns on as soon as you lift the top up. I found that wierd. Very weird.

   The days of paying $400 to $500 for even a entry level laptop is definitely gone. With these brands that are coming out, not only you can afford an entry level laptop for less than $300, they perform as good as some of the $500 laptops out there.This is one of the reasons why I bought a second laptop as our children are homeschooled and the technology seems to accelerate faster and the devices get outdated quickly. This laptop is very fast for its price range and it can do just more than light gaming as well as daily surfing and work-related tasks. The screen is nice and bright and can play HD videos and was able to play Roblox which seems to be very popular with kids nowadays without it lagging.The Wi-Fi also has the standard 5 gigahertz and 2.4 GHz antenna as well as Bluetooth connection so most modern devices will connect to this laptop perfectly fine. The surface area for the the touchpad is also large outside of using a mouse but it's nice and lightweight, it's thin, and for the price you can't beat it 😃👍

   Nice laptop, but it clicks when it starts, (see the movie), like its trying to access the hard drive. Then it gets the error message (in the photo), that says the hard drive is protected by a password system. ??? Why? Something when it was upgraded? Any ideas on how to turn this off? If its seeking the hard drive for no reason, that cant be good long term. All these extra gyrations are also causing a really slow boot up. Its not for corporate use, its for home use, no need for hard drive protection, feels like a mistake that its on. I will turn it off, I just need to know how. Thanks. PConline365?

  I'm not sure about this computer yet. I have been a business systems consultant for 20 years so I'm pretty adept at using laptops.  When I got this one and turned it on, it didn't walk me thru any of the normal start/up set up like I'm used to.  Almost like it was already used. It works great for a few days, really fast and no hiccups, then all of a sudden it shuts off in the middle of working on something, several times in a day.  Also, the other day (after using it a month now), I turn it on and NOW it walks me thru all the start up settings I expected it to a month ago when I turned it on for the first time.  So it's very herky jerky.  I expected to love it for the money, and I really don't.  I am considering returning it for a refund but don't want to start all over with another new computer at this point.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

  While the descrition does not say either way the pictures show the backlight button on the space bar and when looking at this laptop pretty much anywhere it seems this is a pretty standard option.  The particular model I received is not equiped with it.  If this is a feature you are looking forward to as I was perhaps look for this same computer under a different model number.  Outside of this it is a perfect computer for what I need and touchpad is great, keyboard is great, nice to have the separate buttons for mouse clicks in some situiations is helpfull.  I have always been a Lenovo fan because they are built very well and durable. Overall the computer is great but I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard.  Not a huge dealbreaker but would have been great to have.  If this is important to you I highly recomend this computer just maybe shop around for it under a differnt model number.

  I haven't owned a windows computer for the longest time because in the past they have been very slow and experienced a lot of issues. After getting the Lenovo ThinkPad, it has changed my mind on windows computers and I have really enjoyed using it. I have been more productive with this computer because of how fast it runs even with many programs at the same time. The screen size is great and has a great picture quality. I like that it doesn't come with much too much unnecessary bloatware that many windows computers come with. The keyboard feels very comfortable and responsive. The number keypad on the side is very convenient as well. Overall I really like the laptop have had a great experience with it so far.

  I placed my order for my  lenovo laptop yesterday and it arrived this afternoon. I have been working on this computer since then for about 5 hours to browse the webpages and to do work with MS Office applications, and to read from Kindle, etc. I cannot highly recommend it for the very fast speed to start and work with any programs. Much much faster than my Macbook Air! Besides, the windows system is a bit more open than Apple OS. I really don't like the hegemony Apple OS holds over my music, photos, and office files. I could not even update my office on Apple OS. It is really a good computer that deserves enthusiastic recommendation and popularity.

  I was really looking forward to see what optane memory is all about , and if I don't like it , I was going to remove it and install second SSD as storage . Nope . It does not have optane Memory in it , it does not have second PCI-e where you could install optane , Intel RST shows that laptop is not optane ready and Bios has no optane settings . Oh BIOS , that's another thing . I haven't seen bios this bad since 1986 . Barely ANY settings in there . Moving on . Description shows AC wifi but instead it has wifi 6 . Very Happy about it since I have wi-fi 6 AX router and range is great . Screen is good but it's flickering ( Barely noticable ) because bad graphics driver . I know that because when I boot laptop with bootable ubuntu screen does not flicker . I love the gray keyboard , it looks Gorgeous and lights up really nice . Sound is pretty decent but I use bluetooth headset for most of my video watching . I upgraded memory to 16GB and swapped SSD with 500GB WD Black . Everything runs snappy , but I am missing lots of settings that were available on my other  Laptop and my work pc . ( Probably due to bios ) . For example . Power options has no settings for cooling policy , selective usb suspend , Graphic settings , it does not give you power button option to just turn off the screen etc . Maybe when some updates come out it will be corrected . Screen is glossy ..... I don't know who is the genius who makes touch screen and makes it glossy . HELOOOO Think people THINK !!! LOL . Anyway I ordered MR. Shield anti glare screen protector , 15 inch Macbook and Installed it and it's much better I had to do some cutting but it came out perfect . It did not degrade screen in any way and I don't see my self in the screen when I'm looking at something Dark , and Fingerprints are Rare .

  First, the ""Pros""Excellent screen, with good color balance, brightness, and contrast. No light ""bleed"" on dark screen. And - 1080P display - great for videos. Good touch response.With 4 core i5 hyper-threading, 8gb ram, the computer has quite snappy performance - can multi-task, multiple web pages, and can run many games - although probably advisable to use a laptop cooler.....Keyboard feel and travel is good - back light a great addition - has 2 level brightness. Track pad works perfectly.Sound from speakers is pretty good for this size laptop - sound through headphone port is excellent.Updating went well - no issues.  This thing boots in only a few seconds - did I mention this is pretty quick?Full size USB ports, USB C port, HDMI port, SD port, and headphone port.The SSD is 256GB, but can use an SD card to expand storage.Cons:When a card is installed in the SD port, it sticks out a little - should have been designed to be flush.Although lighted keys are great, if the keys were dark with the light lettering, would have been even easier to see.Finally, there seems to be conflicting info as to whether there is (or is not) Optane memory installed - however there is an app for Optane management installed on this computer.Overall, quite a good computer in this price range, and I find it surprisingly capable.

  Getting ready to do online class when the computer stopped working and nothing would work on it! I was given the option of a refund or a replacement... I did like this laptop a lot with the backlight keyboard, nice feel to the keyboard, and the touchscreen was very convenient to have! HOWEVER, I hope I don’t regret replacing it and have another issue with the second replacement!  If yours does the same, just ask for your money back, because that might be a sign that this is a defected model. Good luck!

  it's a very good product I will recommend it to anybody who's looking for a laptop but my only problem with it is when I received it I open the box and I noticed that on the right edge of my laptop near the SD card slot the cover on that side seems like it's loose door bent out

  I bought this laptop because it had many attributes that I was looking for in a computer... touchscreen, backlit keyboard, compact size, etc. It got to me in good condition, and it’s beautiful and seemed powerful. I ended up returning it because my last laptop was super lightweight, and although this computer isn’t heavy by any means, I just wanted a laptop closer to the weight of my previous model. Also it gets a little hot on the bottom shortly after being turned on, which is a pain point for me.I do have an issue with the seller taking out about $100 when I returned it (as a restocking fee). I know that’s their policy, but that’s like 20% of the entire purchase. It’s honestly ridiculous. I even set the settings back to brand new before sending it back to them, and put MORE padding in the package than it had arrived with, just to make sure it got back to them in perfect condition. So just reallllllly be sure before you buy this and especially before you open the box. $100 down the drain when I literally sent it back within the 30 days and in perfect condition. Just be really sure. That’s all. And yes I contacted the seller directly about this, but they failed to see/care about my point of view.Rating is strictly for the laptop. I didn’t really use it, but it’s a beautiful and powerful machine. Backlit keyboard has like 3 levels.

  I was hoping that this ASUS laptop would be a pleasant upgrade to a 6 year old ASUS ROG laptop. Unfortunately, right out of the box this laptop immediately started overheating on startup. When I opened up an internet browser, or tried using the file explorer, this laptop froze several times. Seems like plain bad luck, but this is really disappointing since I've had an ASUS for several years, and it never had problems like this.

  This is a decent laptop except for running a bit hot. That is to be expected considering the amount of raw processing power packed into it. However, my RMA experience with ASUS has been an absolute nightmare. I sent the computer into RMA due to some minor screen problems, was given a quoted repair time of 2 weeks with the possibilities of minor delays due to the current situation. The computer was delivered to them on August 30th. It is now 2 months later and they still haven't fixed it.  They claimed they had to transfer it to another repair center, which they spent 6 weeks doing. Now that the computer has arrived at the new repair center, there haven't been any updates for 2 weeks despite multiple calls. It is for this reason, and no fault to the product itself, that I can NOT recommend this, nor any other ASUS product, to you. Since the consumer service experience is simply deplorable.

  You cannot beat the price to performance on this laptop. The processor alone makes it standout at this price range, but WOW Asus really put together a great machine.This laptop has been nothing short of amazing for me. The reviews about fan noise are extremely overstated. If you are running a AAA game on it of course the fans are going to spin up and make a little noise.Also, the review that says the keyboard and track pad locked up on them I highly suspect they accidentally disabled them in armory crate.I’m not going to waste time restating what others have said and keep this simple.The build quality is superb. The laptop feels sturdy and the screen has minimal flex when opening with one finger from the center or either corner.The I/o is sufficient and exactly what you would want from a gaming laptop. 3 USB ports, a USB-C port, HDMI out, a full Ethernet Jack (not one that pops out), and a combined headphone/mic jack.As far as the specs go, I’ve included a screenshot of a benchmark list for common laptop CPU’s as of today 2/25/21. The Ryzen 7 4800HS is a monster. The 1660ti max-q is the equivalent of having a 1070 and both of those GPUs are more than enough to run today’s AAA games at 1080p with reasonable graphics settings. Not to mention the screen with 144hz refresh looks PHENOMENAL.One final small thing worth mentioning is the bloatware included with this system is minimal and that’s great in my opinion. Just uninstall mcafee and you are good to go if that type stuff bothers you.Overall, if you are looking for a laptop in the 1k-1100 range stop looking and buy this one. It’s worth your money.

  Scored this beauty from the mason warehouse page . And let me tell you , was it worth the “risk factor” to buy it used and save several hundred dollars on it ....DUH.The laptop came through with all included apparently work and accessories ( power cord and brick ) and ALL important stickers were left of the keyboard deck as well as the under monitor bezel.Seriously couldn’t tell you if the device was ever actually used . I absolutely love it. The size is perfect for my backpack. The fit and finish from ROG is amazing .In the end I’d say this is less a review of how exceptional the laptop is and more about the Amazon warehouse .  I mean it’s only ever going to be a product of its components so as long as you’ve researched what you want from a system and order with confidence go with the risk and save those dollars for all the peripherals out there to add to your new laptop

  I had to replace my laptop and spent a lot of time researching a new one. I had ordered one from another non-Amazon source and, despite the seller's assurances, it wasn't going to work for my needs. I returned it and began searching again.  A friend recommended this machine (this is my first non-Dell laptop purchase). So far, I absolutely love it! It has the perfect memory and power to run the games I play, it handles my graphic design and word processing needs as well. It is fairly quiet. The battery life is good (so farr). The monitor is excellent. I didn't realize it didn't have a camera, but I simply bought a small webcam to use as needed (I teach music lessons via Skype). The audio is really good, too. Clear sound.

  This may or may not be a good laptop.

   I came across this computer while looking to replace my previous laptop, a predecessor of this one, the Zenbook 3 (UX390). I had it for about 2 years and the only issue I had out of it was some strange fan noise occasionally.I liked the innovative use of the trackpad as a secondary screen, the dedicated MX250 graphics, as well as a 10th gen i7 CPU. So I decided to pull the trigger on a brand that has worked well for me in the past.*The Good*The computer itself is built very well. Zero screen flex, nice rigid keyboard deck, silky smooth trackpad, and the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. The screen pad is neat, but kind of a novelty mostly.Overall performance is snappy, and light gaming can be done without it breaking a sweat. The small form factor and solid build quality make it easy to want to take it along wherever you're going.*The Bad*After two weeks of ownership, however, I have decided to return this computer for screen related issues.Within a few days of having it, I began to notice faint lines in the screen that were lighter than the rest of it. This was most apparent when displaying a solid color on a large portion of the screen. These lines would come and go, and weren't super obvious unless a solid color was displayed. I also noticed some flickering at times as well.Then, while watching Netflix the other day, the entire screen suddenly became washed out and flickery. Two restarts and a full factory reset have confirmed that it's a hardware fault and not a driver or software issue.I had high hopes for this computer, and I'm sure this is an isolated flaw in my particular unit, but a major hardware failure two weeks into ownership has me wanting to go with something else instead.

  The laptop has a very nice textured metal look to it. The Screenpad is an innovative design combining the best parts of a touch-pad, a macro-key add-on, and a small second screen. My only issue here is that, because you have to switch between these functions, it causes pauses in work-flow as you switch between them. This is particularly true when switching on the track-pad function to move around the screen and then back to whatever other function you were using on the Screenpad. However, the software design for these functions is excellent. There's even a quick, temporary switch to make it easier. It's only the fact that it needs doing at all that slows things down. Once you learn the ways to move things between screen and pad, it's very easy to do. I actually wish there were more Screenpad apps. (There are just a few.) But the ones there are work quickly and well.The main screen is bright and readable and the extremely small bezel makes it look even nicer. It's only 1920x1080 but for a 13-inch laptop, that's not bad. It isn't a touch screen. I caught myself reaching up to the screen to touch it a few times. Having a touch screen might have solved the issue I had with switching functions on the Screenpad.The combination of a powerful processor, a decent graphics card, and a solid-state storage drive makes this device agile and responsive. The graphics card has only 2GB RAM, which isn't enough to support use in Premier Pro or After Effects GPU-based rendering without a trick but it's enough to handle most every other task. The 16GB internal memory was great for all kinds of tasks.The port allotment for the device is excellent. 1 USB-c 3.1 v2 port, 1 USB-a 3.1 v2 port, and 1 USB-a 3.1 v1 port make it possible to connect all kinds of add-ons without a separate hub. The built-in HDMI port is very nice to have too. Finally, a full stereo out and microphone in audio jack is great to have. It also supports WiFi (though not version 6) and BlueTooth for non-wired connection.I do wish that it had a USB-c power connection since all of my existing power bricks are that type. The former standard barrel power connector is OK, but the power brick is of a substantial size. It would be nice to replace it with one of the newer, smaller GAn models.All-in-all its a great device even given the caveats above. I notice that it has a sibling model where the Screenpad is located above the keyboard and the touchpad is a separate device. I like that design better even with the $400 difference in price. Consider whether you intend to use it with a mouse all the time or whether you'd find switching between trackpad and other functions a bottle-neck. If that's not a problem, this is a good, workable device.

It’s been like 4 times today that it has done that, and it’s entirely frustrating.That needs some serious improving ASAP.*****UPDATE ******After this review,  I was connected to the tech support who was so patient & worked me through the settings...My laptop was initially on the sleep mode, so it shuts down periodically!

  I had a business class HP laptop for the past 3 years, and while it was dependable and easy to use, it seemed that every time it got a Windows update, something else stopped working properly.Deciding to go with a Chromebook was one of the best decisions I've made! It is compact, easy to use, lightweight, and I LOVE the touchscreen feature. The battery lasts a very long time. It boots up quickly and multi-tasks well! Can't say enough good things about this laptop/tablet!

  This HP 14 Chromebook was pretty decent outside of some power issues that left me dumfounded.  The touchscreen was responsive but the viewing angles were atrocious. For $10 more you can get a 15.6” Acer with touchscreen IPS and a higher resolution.PROS: Good battery life / Responsive touchscreenCONS: Sometimes wouldn’t power on / Terrible viewing angles / Priced too high for the low resolution screen.The Acer Chromebook with AMD processor and 1080 IPS touchscreen is hands down better in every way to this HP Chromebook and only $10 more at the Local “Red Bullseye” store.

  Horrible. I just received this laptop today and I am already returning it. First the laptop would not turn on even after I left if on the charger. When it finally came on at 99 % battery life I was on it for about 10 minutes and the screen froze and blacked out. I could not get it to turn back on. Very disappointed now I have to wait nearly two weeks or more to get my money back and this was bought for school.

  Buenos días, en las descripciones de la computadora describe que es pantalla táctil y al utilizarla me doy cuenta que no es lo especificado, le agrego la captura de pantalla para que lo describa, me gustaría que me resuelvan este problema.

  A very nice laptop has good enough battery life and a very nice build, the screen quality is a bit low for a 2020 laptop but its fine, the processor is pretty snappy i wouldn't bother doing gaming though since it does not have great dedicated graphics but overall its a great computer definitely recommend it for the price.

  I bought this laptop for myself and I absolutely love it! It has given me zero problems, and I love that the screen is also a touchscreen. The battery life is fine, it’s just like any other laptop battery life really. Its slim, and lightweight, so very easy to pack up & take anywhere with you. I use this laptop for mostly personal use, but I could easily use it for business reasons as well. This is my first laptop I’ve ever purchased brand new for myself, and I have no complaints about this product so far and would highly recommend it! Lenovo has good customer service as well if you would have any questions or problems.

  In the picture,  my old ASUS laptop is on the left, bought new for $600 in 2019. The new 2020 Lenovo on the right, for $499. I needed to replace my ASUS due to a manufacturing defect, and decided I needed something a little larger.Comparing the Lenovo to the ASUS-- Lenovo is much faster even though it has around the same specs as the ASUS. Loading webpages, opening programs, etc. is almost instant on the Lenovo.- My biggest issue with my ASUS is that it would easily overheat if my screen was too bright or I overwhelmed the CPU fan and it made this awful grinding noise, I have yet to experience any overheating issues with the Lenovo even with running webpages, videos, games, and over programs at once.- The keyboard buttons do look cheaper since they aren't backlit like on the ASUS, but I find the keyboard overall to be much easier to see and use on the Lenovo, the number pad on the right is a great addition as I use my laptop for work as well as gaming.- The screen on the ASUS does seem to be better quality picture as it's more of a touchscreen glass, and the Lenovo screen is more of a traditional laptop screen. However, both touchscreen work just was well, and I feel like I found see as many finger marks as I do on the glass screen.- The sound quality and loudness is much better on the Lenovo, like, super loud.- Even though these two laptops are vastly different sizes, they weigh about the same. I find the larger screen on the Lenovo also easier to see, as the ASUS is only 13"".All in all, I am pleasantly surprised with how well the laptop works. Along with the expedient shipping and care put into packaging. Good warranty terms as well. Over one month in and everything is still working as good as the first day, let's hope it keeps working that way!

  The laptop is great; however, the Windows 10 S Mode prevents installing software not found in the Microsoft Store. Nevertheless, the S Mode can be disabled for installation of non-MS apps.Still, I bought is as a gift for my wife, and she loves it... So I love it! ;)

  I have this same model purchased by my employer for work use, but wanted to buy my own for personal use. I shopped for laptops for a few years but really wanted this one because it's lightweight (3 lbs), the perfect screen size for me (14""), has an anti-glare screen (hard to find these days), has mouse buttons, and the specs match my needs. I first tried buying a brand new one directly from Dell ($1227) because I was afraid to buy refurbished. Ironically, the new one was defective and I decided to return rather than replace it. I then tried to buy a new Latitude 7490 directly from Dell, hoping to have better luck. Nope! Defective as well. So I decided to give this refurbished one a try. It works perfectly! Can't believe how much money I saved and I ended up getting exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend.

  Extremely fast shipping (1.5 days)!  Also very protective inside packaging.  I am very impressed, for a ""renewed"" laptop this looks brand new.  There is an included quality assurance check sheet signed off by multiple people, a nice touch.  There is a  detailed set up guide which has tech support #'s (just in case).  Also the invoice was very descriptive of the components inside the laptop. It is exactly as ordered.  The performance so far has been fantastic, very easy setup with no problems.  I would highly recommend buying from this company.

  La primera portátil que adquirí para mi hija venía en excelente estado prácticamente tal como lo indica la descripción sin rayas ni defectos perceptibles, estaba como nueva, esta fue reconstruida por PrimeTimeBuys. Debo decir que esta serie goza de una gran reputación y es excelente y funciona perfecta. Al ver la primera quise adquirir otra para mí, esta vez vendida por Tech Mart muy triste decir que parece que la sacaron del cajón de desecho y mi la enviaron, rayada, sucia, pegajosa que da asco, el sticker como cubierta de la tapa se nota, tornillos en mal estado en la parte inferior, un desastre completo, siente que ha sido la PEOR COMPRA que he realizado, por un proveedor que parece no importarle la presentación, ahora supongo que tendré que correr con los gastos de envío.

  This laptop works like a boss!  I'm using it for school and the unit originally showed up with a corrupted install, the wrong power adapter, and a battery that only lasted 1 - 1.5 hours max.  I'm leaving full marks here because contacting EPC customer service has been more than pleasurable and they took care of every single issue I've had.Now the laptop does what I need it to, is light, powerful, fast, and will last as long as I need it to to get my work done.I could not be more happy with this laptop.

  This is a great laptop.  I have it dual booting Windows and Linux Mint.  This is out of the box linux compatible.  The battery life is pretty good.  The display is great.  Mine came with 16GB  of ram in one stick.  It has two ram slots.  The specs online show the ram is upgradable to 32GB if you really want that much. The drive is an NVMe.  For those that like to take things apart, the ram and the NVMe are right there once you take off the bottom cover making it easy to upgrade both the ram and the NVMe.  I have not had any heat issues, runs quiet.  I really like it.

  The computer itself is exactly what you pay for. No issue there. But by god. Trying to get your one year subscription to Office 365 that is included is a joke. You have to go through HP which first will try to tell you that it only is a 30 day free trial even though in the description it clearly states one year of office 365 is included. I have been chatting with them for almost two hours now, and have had to send them multiple photos of what the box says. Honestly, I should’ve  just bought the 365 subscription for $99.99. I could’ve taken the two hours I’m invested into this customer support session and put it towards other aspects of my life and came out ahead...

  Item weight of 3.9lbs in the ""technical description"" is **highly inaccurate**. Im so happy I bought this laptop despite this 3.9lbs inaccuracy, as this laptop is extremely lightweight and portable - probably under 2lbs. As another reviewer said $1300+ laptops are often crapshoots --- my mid2012 Macbook Pro gave me constant headaches since 6months after purchase-- problems that even Applecare Warranty couldn't fix and Applecare refused to replace it so essentially i wasted $1500 on my easily overheated Macbook Pro and never wanted to waste $1500 on a basic laptop again (next expensive laptop will be Razer Blade or Gigabyte AERO). This time around, I needed a basic laptop for trading software programs that take up a lot of memory, so I bought 2 of these and will probably buy 1 more as I need to run 6 programs total so Ill split 2 programs on each. My experience: nicely packaged, arrived with a full battery, setup in under 5 minutes, it recognized all nearby wifi options (and a lot of cheap laptops don't recognize wifi signals) , i downloaded the software that I needed in a few minutes. Everything set up fast and seamlessly. Trackpad super easy to use. It sometimes briefly/momentarily lags when I type but i also type 90wpm .... I bought the $50 two year Asurion insurance just in case it turns out to be a lemon in 6month+ . For $270 , with insurance, i can buy 3 and be happy using these for specific, niche purposes or as reliable backups. Ive tried other cheap laptops and this has the User Experience of an expensive Apple laptop (im much happier with 3 of these than 1 2019 Macbook Air like my sister just bought). Only real CON is it could be brighter (it definitely has lower brightness than both Macbook Pro and Macbook Air). I will be running the software this upcoming week Monday-Friday for 8hours/day-- so unless when I actually run the software it freezes, crashes, or overheats excessively -- I'll remain a happy camper. Will keep the actual functionality updated in the comments.  But so far, thanks JUMPER!!! Please, fix your 3.9lbs description (which might scare buyers off like it almost scared me off) because for the price, size, *specs* (6gb ram), and weight this laptop rocks!

  Was not expecting much from this when purchased, but I gotta say it works REALLY well. Without all the bells and whistles of useless programs and features most people will never use, this is PERFECT for a student or even your elderly parents. Simple and easy to use and lighter and more compact than an Apple of the same size.I did install Firefox because I really don't like Microsoft; AND I DID NOT WANT TO PAY $600 plus FOR AN APPLE...and it runs way better than the installed Microsoft Edge version of Explorer. Able to have 10 tabs open, doing various things and performance was not compromised. Whether keeping up with your social media to Streaming video full HD video, this laptop SHINES!!! The display is simply beautiful.While it doesn't have a ton of hard drive space, that's what external drives are for. I have been storing ALL of my files on one since I had a massive HD fail on me about 15 years ago.  And if you need word processing there are many great FREE programs you can use. And the battery life is BETTER than my daughter's Apple!!!YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PERFORMANCE & EASE OF USE FOR THE MONEY!!! So stop thinking and click that ""BUY NOW"" button!

  This is a really good computer for the price. Don't let the chinese/japanese characters scare you. It boots up pretty fast, maybe 10 seconds at most. It's made out of aluminum and feels sturdy while staying light. The bottom heats up but wouldn't burn your legs, maybe sweat. There's some bloatware but it's easy to uninstall. One of the things I don't like is the coloring, the WHOLE computer is the same material and color except for the trackpad (which is also nice). The fact that its 6gb of ram and 64gb of memory should make you buy it considering the price. It lags sometimes, but its bearable, you won't have programs crashing though. I'm using this mostly for watching youtube and school, so it works for that. I haven't played any games with it but I wouldn't recommend it because there's only 64 gb and the processor isn't the strongest. 4.5/5

  The EZ book has a great screen - sharp, with rich colors, and 1080x1920 resolution. The cpu has 2 cores, and it can run at 2GHz+ even though it is rated ar 1.1GHz.6GB of memory helps tbe laptop to run smoothly and responsively.The laptop feels more upmarket than the price indicates. The screen is in Aluminum housing, and the keyboard feels solid. I added 128GB sd card to increase the standard 64GB disk space.Overall, i am happy with the purchase.

  I don't normally write reviews, but I'm so happy with this laptop that I thought it deserved a review.  It arrived yesterday and so far it has exceeded my expectations.  This a good looking, light weight laptop.  Set up was a breeze due to the on-screen assistant.(loved her voice).  I am amazed by how quickly it boots up.  When I turn  it on  I'm at the login screen in seconds.  A touch of my finger on the fingerprint reader and I'm immediately at my desktop.  The picture quality of the full HD screen is beautiful.  The webcam also produces a very clear picture.  I also appreciate its range of ports including a USB Type-C.  The backlit keyboard is an added bonus.

  for my purposes like excel, word, browsing, social media, blogging, light photo-editing, and other non-intensive (non-gaming) activities, this laptop is great. it's fast, 0 to 60 in 10 seconds (the fingerprint reader helps rather than using the password). it's quiet; it's replacing an old dell inspiron 15 which had become a constant whir of fan and hard drive so that the acer feels almost eerily quiet. i did due diligence and the big bang of cpu, graphics, fhd, ram, ssd, wifi 6, backlit kb, and fpr beats anything out there (there's an asus vivobook that's comparable for a little more and was the last competitor in the running). who knows what the build quality will give me for years of usage but if it's half-decent, it shouldn't become obsolete in just a few. my only complaint as of now is the ever-so-slightly crooked 'full hd 1080' sticker on the left-bottom bezel of the screen, but i'm an ex-qc guy whose eye has been spoiled by too many close inspections. but if anything else wrong appears (knock wood), i'll edit this review.

  This is a pretty good Acer laptop. I have used Acer laptop since 2016 and this model has just been purchased earlier this month. It runs very fast and boots up completely in less than 10 seconds. The i7 core 11th gen quad core CPU with 8 threads and 12 MB cache makes this laptop to handle multi-tasking easily. You can open up more than 20 web browsers without lagging. Thanks for the 16 GB RAM too. However, there's no much discount to buy this laptop now. But the value of the laptop is still lower than same specs Dell, Lenovo, and HP laptops. It's a decent deal on Amazon.

  This was a super good deal as they are now selling for ~$500 more than I paid. My only complaint is I wish I would have bought another one for my wife but 3 days after I receive it, realized what a great computer it was for the price (paid $799 from Amazon), they were sold out when I tried to purchase another one. Super fast with a beautifully clear screen, aluminum case, SD hard drive, it's GREAT!

  The laptop is super fast, and the performance is amazing. The screen quality is good, but the touchpad is slightly shaking and needs to be fixed, but it is just a minor issue. The utility you derive by paying for this product is satisfactory, and you won't regret it. I am not a gamer, so I don't have any idea for a game, but you can run the heavy application smoothly without any lag.

  There were some fan and screen issues until updates were done, which included BIOS updates.  Once the updates were easily done then the laptop works like a charm.  The extra RAM, I7 and IRIS video makes it pretty zippy.  Used by college student.

  The lap top came with a ""manager"" installed on the machine, which I cannot delete or exchange it with.  This way the seller will have access to all my passwords and operations that I do.  Clearly this is a crime, a serious fraud!!!!

  This was purchased as a Christmas gift and was opened by the recipient on December 24.  I received a call last evening that the Chromebook will not turn on any more.  This is after being used just a day over two weeks.  I am extremely disappointed in this purchase and must now look into returning it for a refund.

  The device itself is in great working order - seems brand new, being that it's refurbished.  HOWEVER, this came to me kinda janky-looking.  It was SPRAY PAINTED.  I understand it's a refurbished product, and I buy them all the time, but this is probably the worst of all the refurbished products, aesthetically-speaking, I've ever bought.  I think it was literally spray painted and then put it a box and shipped to me.  It still reeked of spray paint, seemed a little tacky/sticky still, and there were some paint mistakes and smudges.  I'm giving this to someone as a gift, and am a little embarrassed of the quality of it.  It seems to work fine (which, really, is all that matters) but I'm very disappointed in the physical appearance of the product.

  This thing is a piece of crap. Slow, Janky, just what you would expect from Google and Dell. This useless waste of money doesn't even run appstore - the fact I was able to hack Linux onto it is the only reason it never went into the trash can and even at that its sitting on a shelf ever since due to the fact that a tortoise covered in molasses in January is faster than this overpriced piece of trash.

  Just unboxed and havent had time to test everything but I wasn't too thrilled with the lack of padding in the box that it was shipped in.The metal in HDMI and USB ports are OXIDIZED/RUSTED. It looks like it was dropped in the ocean.Headphone Jack is cracked.Screen is damaged.The front of the laptop peels right open exposing it's guts. See pics.*UPDATE: I ordered a replacement. It was in better shape than the first one. I'm returning it because the touchpad on this one is damaged. The cursor jumps around erratically making it hard to click on things. These items belong on craigslist not Amazon.

  I ordered this renewed. Looks brand new. I've worked in IT for 25 years and this is what I use at work. Easy set up. Product key got scratched off bottom. Amazon support hooked me up with Vertec and they had a product key for me in less than 24 hours. Top notch service. This isn't a gaming machine, but a fantastic business machine. The SSD makes boots super-fast. Back lit keyboard. Light. Good screen. Probably saved at least $300-500 buying refurbed.Built in speakers are pretty good. Very pleased so far. I'm going to put it through its paces but so far everything has been perfect. Can't even tell it is refurb.

  Everything about this laptop i like and i am very satisfied, with 8G RAM and 256G ROM my gaming experience is more enjoyable than what it use to be, i still suck at it though...lol. E-mail, facebook, you tube... everything that needs to load or play a video will play and load almost instantly. i dont feel embarrass when doing a presentation because of the little buffering wheel in the scree. I had a 4G RAM AND 64G ROM, it work great never had an issue, it was just old, so i replace it and i wish i would off done it sooner. i need lots of storage but i solve that problem with an external [hard drive] Book. I keep it in my house and as long as it has an internet connection i can access it from anywhere. I strongly recommend itWhen buying a...... Smart Phone,Tablets, Laptop or Desk top, i always look for The RAM, ROM, PROCESSOR and VIDEO/SCREEN QUALITY. For those not familiar or electronic smart, the higher the number the better experience you will have. Lots of people might or might not agree with me. but for those that dont know anything about electronics this will help you a lot. Dont look for the price or the brand unless you care more about Name brands and not performance. Alway try looking for a 6G ROM or better and that will give you an idea. hope this help you a little more.

  Defective product.  Integrated camera will not function; battery life exceptionally short (contrary to seller's claims) wireless connectivity unstable; unit was more than 4 years old. Dell lists as ""warranty expired"" ""unsupported"" not eligible for Dell support or diagnostics.  I would not keep this piece of trash if it were free ( I would probably have to pay a disposal fee).

  The Dell laptop is a great buy and it looks like a new unit. However even more impressive is the seller's customer service. There was a minor problem, and I contacted the seller by email.

  This laptop looked good for a refurb, a little dent near where a cable plugs in but otherwise very clean. Arrived quickly, and had a good layer of bubble wrap on it. Sadly I have to return it as the mouse does not respond properly, it lags so much and then suddenly works ok, then not. I have not installed anything on the laptop yet so it is not a program I put on it. When I went to return it I didn't have the option to exchange it, so I'm returning it. Hopefully the process goes well. I'll update if needed.

  I don't like giving a bad review. But this laptop just kept shutting down for no reason. We put in all the updates it didn't help. It got worse if the cooling fan came on it would shut down. Sent it back . Still like my other Dell products. Was disappointed with this one not working.

  Solid laptop for the money.  W10 Pro, back-lit keyboard, SSD, nipple mouse if you're into that.  6th gen i5 isn't the newest thing in the world, but its plenty fast for a web/office grinder.  Also has a nice docking port if you want to buy the proprietary Dell dock for another ~35.Only negatives are no cd drive (not really a problem for me) and no removable battery.

  This chromebook is definitely what I hoped it would be.  My other half wanted some type of tablet or laptop or something that he could easily carry with him.  The HP Chromebook fits that and is fast and easy to use.  The battery life exceeds that of my laptop computer.  It arrived earlier than had been projected as delivery date.  The seller emailed a couple weeks after delivery to verify that the product met my expectations and that I had no problems or questions.

  I've purchased refurbished laptops before, and this might be unusual, but they're typically charged up and free of dust, debris, fingerprints and scratches. I have to dive in a little deeper to functionality, but first impression was disappointing. Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old for homework, but I think the scratches and dirt make it less than ideal as a gift. Also, it has a webcam, so if you're getting this for a gradeschool student, just be aware and cover the camera.

  The Build quality is good but some useful features are missing and the performance isn't as good as expected for the price paid.Pros:- Good build quality- The Fans are smooth even when spinning fast, no high pitched whining noise.- Very responsive in web browsing and other various programs- High refresh rate screen- The RTX 3060 is cooled well even under heavy loads- MSI still lets you undervolt the 10th gen Intel CPU's- Good built in audio DACThings I didn't like:- The Intel 10th gen i7, I'm not a fan of the higher end 10th gen Intel chips, they like to run hot and throttle down often which means your not getting all of the performance advertised. Too much tweaking such as undervolting is needed to make them only a little bit better.- No thunderbolt, it didn't keep me from buying but it seems a little odd to not have it when there are two USB C ports.- The RTX 3060 is capped at 75W so it's a max Q, it still does ok but I would have liked a higher watt version.  Perhaps the CPU MSI picked and the heat it generates made this not possible.- The screen isn't very colorful- No SD card slotOverall I'd look at other laptops using a Ryzen or newer Intel CPU when paired with an RTX 3000 graphics card.

  I got this laptop a few days ago and have tested it for nearly 48h.Some things to consider• Pretty good screen for a laptop. 144hz and good looking out of the box• Laptop frame feels solid but isnt overly heavy.• The 6gb RTX 3060 runs games really well. Division 2 averaged over 120 fps at max settings at 1080p. I tested war thunder, escape from tarkov and  mordhau as well and both were extremely smooth (both hit 144hz reliably at ultra 1080p). No noticable input or screen lag in mordhau so fast shooters  will benefit as well.• No noticeable micro stutters when switching from• The laptop top doesn’t feel hot under pressure but I wouldn’t play this on my lap.• I added a 1tb WD Blue NVMe stick to this laptop, its easy to do and there are videos of how to do it.• The GPU runs cool for a laptop (avg 78 under pressure) but the CPU doesn’t. You can fix this by limiting the max power in power settings for the CPU or undervolting it. The cpu has initial spikes in temp but usually ends up in the mid 80s which is a little hot but expected.• Use dragon center to tune the performance. Don’t run extreme performance without cooler boost.• Buy a cooling pad and watch temps for the CPU, the CPU is the only thing that holds this beast back because it tends to hit high temps (95c max from what I saw) if left at max settings.• It has 2x USB3.2and 2x USB-C so you might need to buy an usb dongle. It has a single jack for a headset so you might need to buy a splitter depending on your headset.• One HDMI only. No displayport at all which is something to consider. The HDMI is capable of 4k 60hz but at the end of the day its HDMI. Should be compatible with g sync or g sync supported monitors.

  Really enjoyed the laptop for about a week, but noticed that over time it started to stutter.

  Even for the price it's below what you would expect. It might just be my unit, but there were several issues with it out of the box. The screen will black out frequently. The resolution is less than sub-par. It can usually run most things, but will get got quickly. When I'm scrolling the screen will get so unfocused you can't see anything sometimes.

  No blackout issues here. Seems to be hit or miss on this model. Things I've found so far:1. The color feels washed out when compared to other laptops and desktops we have. After research, this seems to be related to the fact that it only has 6bit color, not 8bit. Changing saturation levels helped some.2. Laptop doesn't wake when you open the lid, and options for this are missing in the power options. Cant fix using cmd, regedit or in the bios as far as I can tell so far. Unclear why.I have updated from winS to win10home. I will update if anything else comes up.

  This ""refurbished"" laptop's overall appearance not bad, no significant scratches or dents on case, just obvious worn areas from previous use.  Not a big deal, it's a used computer.

Can't blame this on HP.  The Amazon Renewed refurbisher obviously allowed a substandard product to leave their facility.  Shame on me for not making use of this purchase and discovering these defects until after the warranty return period had expired.

  The laptop itself it's very nice. Took it off the charger & I turned it on last night. Set it up.( It had charged for the last 4 days cause I hadnt been home. ) There were no problems at all. I go to use it this morning and it died. I plugged it back in and it's not showing that its charging. Tried turning it on again and it's not turning on. The price is great and what not. But the battery is trash. Hopefully it is just the battery. I cant afford to buy another laptop.Update: The seller got back to me right away! They'll be shipping out another as well as a label to send back the other one! I'm really grateful for the quick response. Thank you!! Looking forward to the new one. I've boxed up the other one and it's ready to go!

  I wanted to replace my older HP laptop - it was heavier and therefore not as easy to take with me when I travel as well as not responding as quickly as it used to despite keeping up with the updates and making sure to antivirus software working at all times.  This laptop was a good price and had most of the options that I wanted - the only negative being that it had a DisplayPort option rather than HDMI (I connect a larger monitor to it when using it in my home office).  I did make an error and initially set up OneDrive to use for storage, but since I have a lot of data the included storage space was used up almost immediately, so I reinstalled Windows 10 and disconnected the OneDrive as default. Since I also have Google Drive, it was superfluous to use yet another Cloud option for storing any data that I needed.  I don't use it often on battery but when I have, it's been good, lasting longer than my previous HP.  There are some small issues with it going to sleep unexpectedly (even though I've adjusted the Power Options to not do that) but that's a minor inconvenience. Over all I am glad I purchased this HP Elitebook 840.

  I needed a basic laptop because I work from home and my old one finally gave out. I have a tablet that I love but it is mouseless, and has no USB ports at all which makes doing my work difficult.After looking at the reviews I chose this one. This has everything I need..All the apps and a cam and mic, came with Windows 10, several ports, and it is very fast. For under 300$USD I have ZERO complaints. Bluetooth devices set right up, no issues syncing any accounts or apps. So happy I purchased this.ONLY CON (And its not really a con IMO)It is not a touchscreen

  As I am progressing further into my software engineering degree, I needed something a bit more powerful than what I was using previously. I couldn't be happier with this laptop! The 8 GB of RAM and the SSD make everything lightning fast. I didn't even know it had a touchscreen when I first got it, so that was a pleasant surprise! The touchscreen has worked well the few times I've used it so far. I'm still waiting to get a good stylus to see how well it actually works.The only gripe that I had was an issue with the integrated webcam. When you activated the camera, for either video or photos, it would turn on and off and on and off forever. After some searching online, I was able to determine there was an issue with the Realtek directories. Going into C:\Program Files\Realtek and renaming the folder in there from ""RsProviders"" to ""RsProviders_"", the problem immediately resolved itself. I'm not sure if that's an issue between Windows and Realtek, or HP and Realtek, or what. But if anyone else runs into this problem, that should be your first solution that you try.

  I was a bit skeptical of purchasing refurbished. But laptop was in great condition. No dings or blemishes that i could see. My only issue is the battery seems to never go full charge... If I requested I would bet they would send me a new one.....but the way i use it, is mostly always plugged in so it doesnt bother me.....after a year of the way i use it....batyery would go bad anyway. .. I give it an a plus plus for condition of the laptop alone. ...works just fine. Thank you!.

  For the price, this laptop has far exceeded my expectations.  It arrived quickly and in great condition.  There's no fluff in the package as mine arrived with only the laptop and charging cable.  I'm a bit concerned about the Windows 10 license because I didn't have to enter the product key.  I just entered my information and away it went.  Speed is far superior to the laptop it replaced in my home and I'm very satisfied with this purchase at this time.

  This model is VERY fast. That’s due to the 16GB of RAM and the SSD drive. It boots really fast and does everything fast. My model also has the fingerprint scanner. I like that too. I recommended this to a friend and she also loved it.The battery life is good but I’ll probably buy s replacement. As you know refurbished seldom includes a new battery.

  Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars

  I really love my MacBook. I really love this laptop. I'm a huge MacBook fan and this works like new. So far I don't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard, but I heard bad reviews about the keyboard from watching YouTube videos. I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal.

  Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction.

  It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop.

  Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****

  I’ve only had the laptop for a month but I’m very pleased with it. I am not very tech savvy but it was very easy to set up. It takes you step by step through the process. I was a little nervous about it but it was quick and painless. The screen quality is good. I do not do any gaming on it so I can’t speak on that. I mainly use it for email, shopping online, and some Microsoft office things. I would recommend this laptop. It’s light weight too.

  Great laptop for basic tasks. Lightweight, easy to use, and a beautiful display. Touch pad took some getting used to, but does the job no problem. Great for email and browsing on the go. I installed and run office 365 with no issues. Allows me to do the things I need to do on the go. Videos are great quality but speakers are a bit weak. No problem though, I just use headphones. A great buy for a 14 inch Windows 10 laptop. I believe the negative reviews are from people demanding way too much from a computer in this price range. If your intent is web browsing, videos, email, and some spreadsheets or such it's perfect! Exactly what I needed at a great price! If you're on the fence about this one, well don't be.

  I purchased this laptop for one purpose, to use Adobe Cloud products for my business. You can't beat the price for what you get with this laptop.

  Was very pleased that the item shipped rather quickly. Windows set up is an absolute turn off especially if you don’t have an existing account - no fault of the manufacturer/shipper. However, my two draw backs are the fact that you must purchase additional items for disc space as this device doesn’t really have a lot to run programs and this was advertised as a laptop but when I received - it is a lapbook.  Meaning it’s really like a tablet.It extremely light weight. You must make additional purchases to fully open and use programs such as google. I purchased this item for my son to access the internet through google for school. We will add the additional space so that he’s able to use properly. For the orice it’s not a bad buy.

  Just needed a second PC computer for some work-related activities that my Mac couldn’t handle (it’s also quite old but I do t see any reason to replace it). I got this since the other reviews seemed quite good, it’s not as fast with loading high content things, so I wouldn’t recommend for gaming or video-editing activities as I don’t think the processing would keep up, but works fine for basic word processing, spreadsheets, email, etc (streaming is fine, just buffers a bit more/longer than my other computer). Also, this computer does run Windows, but it’s in S-mode meaning you’ll need to turn that off if you want to download any app/program that is NOT from the Microsoft store. It’s easy to do, just google instructions and you’ll be fine, and same goes for when you need to download a program and you get the error message “this download blocked by administrator....” in which you ARE THE ADMINISTRATOR, just google that too, lots of tutorials online on how to get around that as well.

  The only thing I have to complain about so far is the sensitivity of the touch pad.  I have to be careful not to hover over it when I'm typing as several times my cursor has jumped on me.  This is however, my first lap top so my experience using laptops is low.That said, I would have given it a 4.6 if I could have.  I'm new to the lap top scene, and I love this computer so far.  It is so easy to use and the portablity is amazing, even though it is a 14 incher.  I think this size balances nicely between being too small (I like a bigger screen) and being to large to cart around.  I went with windows as that is what I am familiar with, and the computer is very user friendly.I am inexperienced with a lap top but this one meets my needs and is great.

  This was lightweight and slim like a chromebook, but better because you can easily plug it in to a printer and various other normal laptop functions.  Unfortunately, I needed to return it because it wouldn't work for its intended purpose--the keystone online summer school.  This laptop did download the required 64 bit JAVA, but it would not work with the school's software.  We took it to a technician, but he couldn't get it to access the course either.  He guessed it was the processor, and that the school likely did not understand what the technical requirements should be.

  I acquired this machine after having a Toshiba S55T-C5165 for almost 7 years. Unfortunately my Toshiba suffered a processor damage which could no longer be fixed.This MSI is by far a better option than the other brands that exist in the market.It is super fast, fluid in the processes that I carry out that are related to my profession such as electrical engineering, I have no problems running simulators, computer-aided drawing programs such as autocad, solidworks, among others.In addition, all the complementary software programs such as the Dragon Center are an excellent alternative to have control of the cooling of the machine by accessing the revolutions of the fans.The battery life is 7-8 hours with a heavy workload and with all the brightness and definition of the screen it is astonishing.The only problem I found is that in the Dragon Center when the automatic fan selection is left set, the laptop turns off with some games, just at the moment the third fan is turned on, however this does not happen with simulators. that I use for my work.To solve this problem with the games I have chosen to create a custom ventilation mode and with this I solved it.Apart from that, in this month of use I have not had any additional problems.

My frustration with this 2nd laptop is that the screen resolution advertised on the amazon product page is 1920 x 1080 while the actual one is 1366 x 768 - see attached picture. Overall computer is OK for the price and battery working fine but still there shouldn't be false information in the product description.

  I thought I was getting a great deal-I was so wrong. After 3 months the battery no longer holds a charge.  The keyboard had keys that were sticky and made it difficult to work on schoolwork and I was told the keyboard was defective and needed replaced.  It’s too late to return!!!  I will need to buy another computer for school. A waste of time and money.

  If I could give 0 stars on Battery Life, I would. I use this model at work as my daily driver. The whole setup received works great: comfortable mouse, backlit keys, excellent screen resolution for the size and price point.But a dead battery that won't take charge? Come on, guys.

  I need as advertised a black lit keyboard. This is the second PC w/o a backlit keyboard. It has to be lit like advertised.  Return has to be pre paid by them not $20.00 by me. Very poor company!

  This laptop was a problem from day 1.  I did successfully get through to SkyTech with the first issue, just days after receiving the laptop.  Windows was not registering, so bios, then blue screen ""Cannot find Windows"".  I followed instructions they sent me and got that corrected.  Then COVID19 hit and I when I discovered the next problem, SkyTech was radio silent.  I have called no less than 12 times and sent emails, but no responses or call backs.  Now I am months out of my return window, have never successfully gotten to use this paperweight and just want my money back.  There is a hardware problem with this laptop and I cannot have it be down any longer.  I cannot wait for customer service, once they do respond to tell me that I have to send it back to them, they will fix it and send it back in a month.  I need a perfectly working replacement sent out to me and this one taken back.

  Good laptop! I would recommend this. There are a few caveats and some problems (though I suspect this was just bad luck) but first the arguments for it.-well packaged. The unit came strapped tight under stretch plastic and was securely packaged for transport.-good physical condition. I would agree that this is ""A"" grade in its overall physical condition and marks of wear. It could be characterized as ""gently used"".-decent battery life still. I get a good 4 hours of life from the battery despite the age of the platform (2016) under ""normal"" usage. Word, excel, browser, some YouTube.-6th generation Core i5 platform with USB-C. This alone makes going for 6th gen (over 5th and 4th) worth it.-Smart card reader. This is very useful to me (and one of the primary reason I went for this HP series of laptops) as my organization uses smart cards extensively.Now for the ""cons"".-screen is not 1080p despite being advertised as ""FHD"". It's your usual low-grade, washed-out looking ""HD"" panel with 1366x768 (these laptops are built using a wide variety of options and parts). Not a deal breaker, but just so you're aware, you may not get an actual 1080p panel (which is what ""FHD"" means).-Large decal on the lid. Kind of baffling, the lid has a decal that covers the entire lid. It has a ""brushed aluminum"" appearance and texture to it. Makes me think that the lid might have ugly mark(s) on it that the decal is covering. Not a deal breaker, just an unusual thing for me to see.-Damaged SSD. The laptop came with a bad SSD. The refurbisher utilized a 256GB Adata SU650 SSD that initially worked, Windows 10 got set up and rebooted, but then would keep going into chkdsk (storage check for data integrity) and upon scanning it, come to find out, smart errors/bad blocks. I swapped it out for a Western Digital Blue 512GB SSD and then everything was fine.All in all, for $350 this laptop is a good value for what you get in return. If the SSD hadn't been shot, and if the panel was 1080p instead of half HD, this would represent an outstanding value. But as it is, this is okay.

  Bought this for my son to have for school and games on steam. Works pretty good. Going to add another 8gb of ram. Overall the laptop is good. It has a few scuffs and scratches on the lid. It comes with a really cheap power adapter that gets really hot. My biggest complaint to the seller is it was dirty. There where Cheetos or cracker crumbs all around the screen and keyboard. That’s was gross especially with the Covid pandemic going on.

  Amazing laptop, awesome graphics, solid keyboard.  Buy the way, I love the backlit keyboard (use F5 to turn this on).  I've seen lots of complaints about this laptop about slow WiFi, bad touchscreen, keyboard does not light up, etc.  Any new computer or laptop will require some ""setup"". You don't really have to be a computer expert.  Uninstall bloatware. This is preinstalled programs (mostly games) that you'll never use. Also, download and install the required updates.  This may require one or two restarts to get the updates installed. This can  all be done in settings (Windows key, gear icon).

  I bought this for my senior parents so we could video conference w. live close caption for one of my parents.  My criteria was: inexpensive (check); big screen (check); touch screen (check); good camera (check); good speakers (check); big keyboard (check); good performance (check).So this seemed to check all the boxes and overall I am very happy with this computer for its purpose.  However, I didn't consider the keyboard visibility.  I got the silver so the keys are silver with no actual printed/contrasting letters - it relies 100% on the backlight and clear cutouts to let the light through.  So even I can barely see them and the backlight (silver next to light, yes think about it) actually makes it worse.  This is a major major design flaw.  This is why no 5 stars.I'm keeping the machine but purchasing some big letter stickers to put on the keyboard...hope that works!

  I bought this computer for school work and business. It is so loud it is hard to focus over the sound of the fan nonstop whistling/blowing. At first I thought it would just be a minute or two, but after 10 minutes of the constant loud noise, I thought maybe It was overheating, even though it didn't feel hot. I stopped using it for about 20 minutes came back turned it back on, and nope...started right back up. For a computer that is almost 700 dollars, I don't think the fan should be that loud, nor do I think that it should be so constant that I am unable to concentrate

  This laptop is a scam. They claim it has a solid state drive in it and it clearly has a hard disk drive. If you put your ears near the touch pad you can hear the disk being read and writeen. It is slow and I'm returning it. (Not an average joe when I write this review, I'm an electrical and computer engineer.

  This computer with the SSD operating system drive is fast to start, fast to launch programs, and quick to respond. I don't know about gaming but it does Outlook, Excel, browsers, and Zoom conferences with ease. It’s nice to finally have a computer I don't have to wait on to be productive.

  Bought it as a gift, but I set it up before delivering it.  Really sharp display.  Lightweight for a 15.6"".  Good sound. I like the backlit keyboard.  IMO, touch screen on a traditional laptop is of little use (but giftee wanted it).Touchpad confused me greatly.  I couldn't figure out how to access right button functions.  Eventually discovered it does have left and right button functionality at the bottom of the pad, but I didn't see any visual indication of that.  (I have been using mice since 1978 and generally plug one in for anything more than a brief session).All around a very nice laptop.

  For some backstory, I have never been one to buy a product based on its peripherals, such as touchscreen, or keyboard, or anything of that nature. I've always wanted pure power. My first few laptops were purchased based on me weighing how fast it is for the buck.This purchase was different because I had different goals in mind for a laptop. My goal for this purchase was to have the perfect laptop for note taking in college (and to save the hundreds of wasted loose leaf paper used to practice my 5 mathematics courses). The only option for me was a 2 in 1 laptop. After some research, this laptop seemed to give the most bang for the buck. So, here I am!This laptop surprised me in just how premium it felt. It was much thinner than any other laptop I've ever owned, yet it felt sturdier and more secure. Probably because it is made of metal, as opposed to a cheap plastic. I feel like This laptop wont just out of nowhere, have a damaged hinge, like my last laptop did, even though I didn't drop it or anything. It is strong and feels really nice. The metal is a nice matte aluminum, so it feels nice to the touch and doesn't smudge easily.In terms of the performance of this laptop, it is really impressive. This specific laptop in the spin 5 series has impressive stats in every sector of computing. Very nice CPU, with the i7, a lot of ram at high speeds (3200 MHZ I think), and a super speedy NVMe SSD, which makes this thing load stuff almost instantly. It even turns on from being booted off almost instantly. Its very nice and perfect for people who need a computer that is usable the instant that they need it.The touchscreen with the wacom pen is amazing, plain and simple. The touchscreen feels better than my smart phone, so obviously I think its great, and the pen feels almost like i'm writing on paper. More like a slightly sticky whiteboard, but still. Because of that, I believe that 98% of what I write down next semester will be on this bad boy. It just completely replaces pen and paper. Now I can feel better because I am not wasting so much paper.Now for some downsides. The screen aspect ratio is stupid. Yes, I said it, having a taller screen is a thing of the past yet this laptop thought it could get away with it. It looks stupid and feels stupid. Videos now have huge upper and lower black bars, which wastes screen real estate. They even advertise the taller screen as a feature, as if it is a new technology. Come on!This laptop is kind of hard to open. You definitely need two hands to do it and you have to tilt it up to where the hinge is down and the part that it opens is facing up and then you have to pry it open. I think its like this because of the magnets they use to keep it closed. Its not the worst thing, because of how I love this computers features, but It does annoy me.The touchpad is hard to click with. You have to press pretty hard so it makes clicking a little clunky. It isn't the end of the world, but mac books are definitely easier in this sector.And that is about it in the cons department. I highly recommend this product. If you don't mind the cons that I listed, this laptop is perfect for being on the go!

  I bought this laptop for 2 reasons; the 16GB/512GB extra storage, and the active stylus.First the bugs; there's no way to know these things until after I bought it. The charger isn't a USB-C which is the new fad, it's one of the old style. The charger is much smaller and lighter than the others I have used, so that's a plus worth mentioning, just not as small as a phone charger... The USB-A port doesn't go all the way in - on both sides (WTF?) the USB-C ports do though. The SD card slot has a similar problem of sticking out too far for comfort. The stylus position is right next to a screw hole, so a few times I have tried to rip out the screw trying to pull the stylus out... You have to get used to the position, or actually pull up the side to check where you are grabbing - it's just way too close. There is a noticable gap between the base and screen, with a fan out the back trying to use that space for ventilation - which isn't used well since the laptop heats up (this is when using a heavy data-cruncher) to an almost un-holdable temperature in just a few minutes. During 'normal' usage, the temperature is well regulated and comfortable, but under high loads it can't be on a lap.Sound and video are superb =) I wasn't looking for high quality video, but my expectations were exceeded. Great for binging. The battery lasts (these are guesses, not calculations) for ~8 hours doing text editing, ~6 hours binging on youtube, but only ~2 doing data crunchingSecond the stylus. I need a stylus to write math formulas down during video conferencing. It works pretty accurately, but the main problem is that the screen is too flimsy to support writing on it even if i try to put my other hand behind the monitor. If I try to rotate to tent-mode the writing works better, but the camera can't figure out how to flip itself (and there are no app options to flip the camera vertically), and similarly I can't just put it down flat because it wants to change to tablet mode, and can't see me on the ceiling...The big problem with the stylus I found out when I contacted customer service. I expected to get a few extra tips for the stylus in the box, but no. I asked if they sell the tips - they don't. I asked which tips are the right size - they don't know. I asked what styluses are compatible - they said the one it comes with. I asked if they sell the stylus itself - they do, but they don't know how much it costs unless they order it (WTF?) and can't order one unless the original is broken... So the one tip on the one stylus is all you get if you buy this. When I was using it I also found out the hard way that the stylus battery only lasts about an hour, but can be recharged in just a few seconds. Very disappointed in the no-replacement of the stylus.Third the storage; The RAM is 16GB of DDR4-3200 dual-lane. I don't know why they can't say that in the tech specs, but they didn't. The hard drive is 512GB, but came with 50-60GB pre-filled.

  I bought this in order to work from home. Per our work IT guys,  it has malfunctioning wifi and out of date drivers.  I lost signal all the time sitting 2 feet from my router. After installing a wifi extender (which took all day to download), I can sit at my table 10 feet away from the router,  but drop signal all the time. This is a piece of junk,  don't waste your money. I'm stuck because I have to have something to work from home with & can't afford to buy a new one while waiting for a refund on this one.

  I bought this computer as a back-up machine that I can use for basic work if my desktop computer is in the shop. This laptop appears to be fine for that purpose.On the downside, Microsoft encourages use of its ""S mode."" Since I was prompted to use S mode during the set up of this computer, I chose S mode.  I soon regretted doing so when I learned that S mode blocks the installation of third-party software like Chrome. It's tough to get Windows 10 out of S mode, and I ended up taking this computer to a local tech service. That tech service charged me almost $300 to get this laptop working properly!So if you want to download and install third-party software on this computer, DO NOT choose S mode during set up.

  Excellent laptop to have. I fell in love with this laptop right away and it’s a great price for what you get.Pros:-Great size screen-Starts up super fast-Light weight and thin-Great for using Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom.-Plays the Sims 4 (base game and ALL expansions) on highest settings, flawlessly.-Holds a great charge if you are doing internet browsing or basic tasks on your computer.-Touchscreen works nicely. Only have used it a few times because I’m not a fan of using this for a constant touchscreen use. Just not my style, but it does work very nice.-Speakers/sound is very nice-Downloads are super fast-Easy to use and set upCons:-Says it comes with a 125 GB of storage on it, in reality it’s more like 70 GB. However, easy fix is to but an external drive. I use a Toshiba 2 TB external drive (around $60 on here and works amazingly) and use it has an extension of the laptop, problem solved.-when you unplug the charger the screen dims making it hard to edit photos or do any photoshop work.-Does not play highly detailed games well, it lags.All in all, I highly recommend this laptop to almost anyone. If you are a basic gamer this works very nice, but if you are more advanced in gaming, don’t get this. If your games are very detailed or take up a lot of storage, this will not work for you. It will lag (if you’re lucky to have the space to install). But if you like Sims, Minecraft, Roblox...you’re all set. Same goes for if you do any photo editing or any digital illustration work. Pretty much any Adobe program works flawlessly on this.

  My husband purchased this laptop for me after my old laptop, which I had for almost 7 years, went out on me. He purchased this in April and I started having issues with it a few weeks ago. Took it to my brother who is a programmer and he said that the pc randomly shutting down on me, the laptop taking forever to load anything (which he did a speed test on and said the internet was fine), the screen shorting out and blinking on me was the PC failing on me. After 6 months. SIX MONTHS! I only use this laptop for work if I'm home, which isn't often. I've used it probably two-3 times a week for a few hours since I got it. I do not recommend this product at all.

  So I bought a razer laptop here in 2021. It arrived basically dead on arrival. I thought no big deal, got a replacement. Razer sent me a second computer that had a different horrible problem. Then their customer service was a garbage fire.That’s what brought me to this. I bought this computer since my entire desktop pc build was using asus parts. Man they hit it out of the park with this laptop.  If you are on the fence on what brand you should get, don’t be. Asus is the way to go. This thing plays every game I’ve thrown at it at ultra graphics with rtx on (when available) and it handles it with no problem.Things to know. The thing gets pretty loud when pushing the machine. But it stays pretty cool considering it’s this thin. There is no webcam, but it does have a finger print sensor for fast log in.Another big con here, because of the shortage of gaming hardware this seller is doing a bit of a price gouge. Msrp on this thing is supposed to be 1800ish. So I’d wait it out if you wanna buy it for the right price. But if you need something now I highly recommend.

  Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, but there are few but's.- When gaming the laptop microphone becomes totally useless because of the fairly loud fans. All this noise suppression is useless too.- One particular game made the screen go wild with RGB lines. After a certain amount of time. No other game would do so, so i don't know what the problem is. Also this same game works flawlessly on other PC's.- Playing with speakers is almost useless because of the loud fans. Having headphones helps.Other than that i'm very impressed with this beast. Makes gaming very comfortable/portable.

  So far this has been a great laptop. I do have a minor complaint about not having the camera installed though, but not a big deal.Overall the overclocking software gives you some flexibility to get higher frames in your games. The ergo-lift is great because it offers much better airflow, not sure why more manufacturers don't do this.The panel is much better than other panels I have used, having 1440P at your fingertips rather than a 1080P made me appreciate this laptop much more.You can upgrade the RAM, though the RAM is soldered you will be able to run dual channel regardless up to 16GB depending on your soldered RAM amount (8 GB soldered and you add a 32GB RAM, you will have 16GB running in dual channel and the rest in single channel).This is a lower wattage card, if I am correct it is 80W with a dynamic boost up to 100W. So, this is a MAX-Q, do not be confused thinking this is a full 3070 card like these manufacturers are abusing the confusion.As of my writing on 3/23/2021 I would not suggest purchasing this laptop for $2500 as posted on Amazon currently, MSRP is $1799, do not pay this premium unless you absolutely need it.

  This windows laptop is a good basic computing workhorse. It does have intel cpu, but lacks usb-c ports and does not have a lighted keyboard. I do like that larger 15” screen and the dedicated number pad.The screen display is a TFT and not LED so the brightness is sufficient, but it is not a super crystal clear compared to newer tech. The built in sound and microphone plus webcam is good for for zoom and conferencing. I do use a riser to get a better angle but it’s not necessary.I do feel that the computing speed is adequate for business and general needs but for gaming, I would want a better display.The laptop does have 2 USB 3.0 ports but no usb-c.

  I'm very satisfied with the Windows Laptop.  The main reason I replaced my old computer was speed.  It had gotten very slow, even slower than it was originally.  The Windows machine is quick!  In addition, operation is accurate and effecient.

  very upset. The computer was fast but not very good for gaming or school. Camera quality was terrible it was like black and white and very laggy. Also after just 3 days with it the mouse of stoped working. Although it says it has good storage this is not so true you can barely download anything and when u do it takes forever.

   I recently purchased this Mrmayodou laptop computer and I must say I am impressed with a lot of the features and performance that it has. It comes with a built in Intel x64-based Celeron J4115 Quad Core processor and so it works pretty fast when surfing the web or using various software applications. It is pre-installed with Windows 10,  has 8GB RAM, and 128GB M.2 SATA SSD, which makes it an ideal laptop for basic home use and my kids school work while at home. It also allows for an SD or micro SD card to allow up to 128GB of memory storage. It comes with 2.4GHzand 5GHz capability with WIFI as well.  .The laptop also has a good size screen being  15.6 inches and lightweight being around 3.74lbs pounds that makes it ideal for transport when I am traveling with my job. It is also equipped with resolution that is  1920 x 1080 and integrated with Intel HD Graphics  for a great picture which gives the display a crisp and vibrant color that makes it a great computer for games, movies, and of course for daily use. It is also wifi and bluetooth capable. It has a great battery life that lasts up to 6 hours that is nice when I am on the go and can't be near a place to charge it. It has a precision touchpad that makes navigation on it an easy process.Overall, I am impressed with the quality, durability, and design of this laptop and will be using it alot for all my online and work needs

  We were in search of a lower cost option. After researching, we felt confident that we wanted it, this is good for us to stay at home and do cycle classes.There are several advantages for this bike:Compact and save space. While you exercise you can Watch TV or Ipad at the same time. The Seat: The seats are ergonomically designed, comfortable Cushion while you ride the bike.All of the components seem to be well designed and built. Bike assembly took about 20 minutes.The operation is very smooth. There aren't any hick-ups, slips, bumps, etc. when pedaling. It goes from a very easy spin all the way to simulating climbing the steepest mountain. The unit is also sturdy when standing up and pedaling, whether it be for a sprint or just standing up to stretch the legs for a few seconds while pedaling.The bike price vs. its quality is good to have it.

  Due to COVID the gyms are closed and I am unable to go to spinning classes, so I was looking on Amazon for an affordable but good exercise bike.After searching for some affordable and compact exercise bike, I found this SOVNIA bike on Amazon.Arrived in one box, the assembly was easy didn't take longer than 20 minutes and the bike was ready to go. Seems like a good quality built, sturdy and well made.Has almost everything what the more expensive bikes have, but it doesn't bother me that doesn't have the clips on the pedal or the computer doesn't show the resistance/gear.I used it almost daily for the past two weeks and definitely is well-made and seems very durable.PROS:- easily adjustable resistance/tension (come also with an extra resistance pad);- soft but well built handles;- tablet holder - perfect to watch virtual spinning classes;- probably the best seats I ever used on a stationary bike;CONS:- I miss the gear in the bike computer (but definitely isn't a deal breaker).Long story short, the cost of this exercise bike, ease of setup and quality makes it an excellent purchase. Thumbs up!

  As we know, during the time that’s I am writing this, there is a raging pandemic going on, all over the globe. And because of this, my father tends to stay inside more as an extra precaution. But I figured that since we can’t really go anywhere, we might as well buy an exercise machine for in-home use. I decided to go with a bike because treadmills are always very expensive and my father rode his bike a lot. I was a bit skeptical at first but according to my father, he said that this is “what he needed to get moving again.” He now uses it every morning and evening and has already lost 5 lbs! I decided test the machine myself and I was amazed at how smooth the peddling was. There is a wide range of options for the amount of incline you want on the bike. A great led screen to monitor how far you have traveled and an excellent placement of the cup holder. I haven’t seen my father this active in more than a year! I would say that this purchase has definitely made the year go off to a great start!

  Easy assembly, I only took less than half hour, even I only read first few pages of the manual. (hint: the enclosed wrench is useful, it may work better than your own).The quality is pretty good, no chemical/peculiar  smell.I ride a few days so far, it works better than I expected. I use it for half hour of exercise daily, moved it to the center of the garage when begin the exercise, moved it back to the corner when finished (my house is small, so the bike is placed in the garage). Hah, then I felt the most useful feature is those two small front wheels.

  I got this bike for over 4 weeks now and it is sitting in my WFH office. I’m not boojee on equipments, all I want just a bike with easy storage and help me exercise during this pandemic. Quite surprisingly, this budget-friendly bike serves my demands really well...It was easy to assemble everything, I probably got it done within 20mins. Nice part is that there is an extra for every screw. So in case you lose one, you can alway have a backup.Bike's frame is very sturdy, and it didn't give any flimsy feelings.The digital monitor provides real-time distance, speed, time, and estimated burned calories. It also records the last exercise details. I am biking with some exercise Apps, so I generally don’t pay much attentions to the monitor. The digital device holder is big enough for both iPhone or iPad, and they fit perfectly.The bike uses direct-contact brake system as its resistance, but I can barely hear any significant noise from its wool brake pad.I got two more family members using this bike frequently, and we kept it running about 3-4 hrs a day. So far we are really happy with this bike!

  I've only ridden the bike once so far. I paid $260 for the bike and it's solid at that price point. It's smooth, quiet and easy to adjust the tension on the fly. The seat could be a little more comfortable. The handle bars shimmy a little no matter how much you tighten them and the seat will move side to side a little bit, but nothing that is a deal breaker. The display is very basic and there is no pulse reading which would have been nice, but overall it's a well built and easy to assemble bike that I would recommend.If I encounter any problems, I will come back and update my review.

  My “cold weather ride“Lately I’ve been missing the nicer weather and being able to ride a couple hours a day. But, it is the time of year where my exercising has to go indoors. After carefully studying all my opinions, I chose the Yosuda. What a fantastic bike! I wish that I had known about this bike sooner, as I wouldn’t have to spend most of our midwestern riding weather working off what I couldn’t take off during the colder months.And, what a durable ride. I have designated my Yosuda, my “cold-weather ride”.From the beginning, this bike was for me: unbelievable price with FREE SHIPPING, very easy assembly, high-quality parts, and (most of all) a solid & comfortable ride.

  I love these leggings! I work a very physically demanding Healthcare job, & HLTPRO can take all my work activities while still being fashionable and super comfortable.Super soft and sizes are pretty accurate, if you have any doubts - size up 1 size. The pockets are the best part about these pants. They'll hold your phone & keys etc and keep em safe. Items don't fall out while you are active.Very opaque & no show; burpee approved! 😉💯Also, check out HLTPRO's super cute designed compression socks. They don't roll down!

  Excellent, truly high waist, soft, comfy, three pockets, even if I don't look like the model it's firm enough to keep everything in the right place. The colors are beautiful, I bought the blue one and the wine color.The Medium size was made exactly for me: perfect fit.And yes, I do recommend it.

  I bought the capri version of these and got a small. Based on the size guide they should have fit perfectly but they are extremely tight, and I had to struggle to get them on. Then they wouldn't fit all the way anyway. They are very tight. It's possible they need to be stretched out to be worn but that seems unlikely as there isn't much room to gain unless the stitching comes out. Basically, if you get the capris, you may want to try the next size up. I still gave these a five star rating, though, because the material is very soft, the pockets are awesome, and the style is super cute. If they fit, they'd be the perfect leggings and I am planning on buying the medium as soon as I can.

  Update:The company reached out to me and offered a refund for these pants since they weren’t what I expected. I found their customer service very professional, and was pleased to hear that they wanted to make my purchase right, even though it was mainly my misunderstanding on what kind of material these pants were made of. They are probably great for yoga, but not so much my high intensity workouts. Changed to 5 star review for exemplary customer service!These leggings are soft and are great for lounging around the house, but the material is NOT made for working out. Maybe I misunderstood the description, but these don’t feel like they’re meant for sweating in. They are soft fabric, like pajama pants. I will be keeping these for lounging around the house, but not for exercise.

  These are so beautiful and pretty..My problem is I actually sized up cause I like a looser fit..These according to their size chart should be a 20/22..I got the 2x large..I normally wear a size 16 pants as reference and been buying an x large in other brands that fit beautifully..I can wear down to a size 12 in some brands.. And my legs are pretty slim.. Just big hips..These are big on my waist but so tight on my legs it felt like compression stockings..So tight it was pulling the waist of the pant down cause the fabric was being tugged mercifully!I considered washing hoping they would loosen but for this much money I will sadly return..I loved this green color though..If you are tiny legged or love bondage the green is this beautiful hunter green with hints of gray and black..My dream color 😍

  I live in leggings, so I was excited to try these. First off, they are super soft...like I could sleep in these soft. They are not that typical lycra material that suffocates you.  I love the pockets, because umm hello, who doesn't. But if you are looking for tummy control, these are not for you. Yes, they are high rise, but there is no compression. I got a Large, but I probably could've used a Medium to make them feel a little bit tighter.For the price, I think they are a great buy. I will definitely buy more colors.

  Got this after my charge 2 died and wow is it and upgrade I really love it so far! Fair warning though on some things I didn’t realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you’re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don’t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven’t had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way. My boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when I toss and turn at night I don’t accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off.

  I won't be like everyone who gives a bad review because they clearly got a dud (or user-error as it often is). I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.

  Fitbit's App:Let me start by saying, the Fitbit app is unparalleled for sleep, diet and water tracking. I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.

  I finally received my Fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen. I followed all directions, which is charging it and pairing it up to my phone. But as it was paring, the screen just turned black and when my phone tries to finish the set up and asks me for a 4 number pin, I can't type them in because I can't see them. I tried a reset by placing the fitbit on a charger, and nothing happened. There is a vibration when I press the button, but nothing more. I really needed this to work by tomorrow and now this happens. It's a great disappointment.

  So just like another review on here ... my fitbit will not turn on during the setup ... it will slightly vibrate when I press the side button but the screen will not turn on at all.  So disappointed ... will try more but I think I will be returning it tomorrow 😥🥺  Update!!! I got it working and now it seems to be good ... steps are accurate and also the GPS is great.

  All of the bands have broken.  They all break at the spot where they join the band to make a loop.In general the bands have a good amount of resistance and the 5 included are a good mix from lowest to highest resistance. I have been using them for IT Band rehab for the past few months, starting with the lowest resistance. But after a few weeks of use they stretch at the joint and then break. I just move up to the next higher resistance and, however they are all broken now.If you do buy these don't expect them to last long.

  I have had these bands for several weeks, I use them daily, and thus far they have been perfect. I had never really integrated resistance band exercises into my routine but I am glad i did. These bands are great for a bunch of very effective workouts on your upper and lower body. I wasn’t sure how best to use them but luckily they come with a very straightforward pamphlet that covers a bunch of great excercises. The carrying case is also a nice plus because without it they would add clutter for sure. I definitely recommend! Edit: unfortunately after a month or so my heavy has ripped...so not quite as durable as I had hoped.

  Horrible quality. Super flimsy and no resistance worth trying to work out with unless possibly for an elderly person, but they fold/roll immediately. I unpackaged and bypassed to x heavy black band as all others were not worth trying. As soon as I put on and did one m9ve it folded as shown in picture. Bummer... would rate 0 if I could.

  I have huge boobs and it’s a blessing and a curse. I struggle to find tape strong enough to hold them up right without peeling off from sweat and without it hurting like crazy when you peel it off or leaving residue. Well ladies, this tape holds EM up really nicely, can withstand the heat, and removes easily without leaving any residue. I will say though, removing the tape from your nipple does hurt a bit (maybe I’m just too sensitive), so I would cover your nipples and then tape over them. But I recommend this tape for sure! It almost looks like a tube top on me lol.

  I’ve got boobs the size of medium watermelons, G cups...to say I was SKEPTICAL is underplaying it. BUT, dang! I got the tape for a Halloween wedding, I wore a plunging v neck dress and ya girl didn’t need her 6 kids breastfeeding boobs flapping out and ruining the party or just like falling to my knees!  So I got this tape with minimal hope when it arrived looking like an ace bandage and some pasties and I was so wrong! The flower nipple covers are plush, perfect for hiding even the MOST aggressive nips, the adhesive for the flower itself would be great alone for a smaller chested lady! Now the tape, that stuff is MAGIC, it’s stretchy so you don’t lose natural movements and it’s also perfect for keeping your curves and not squaring you off. A little goes a LONG way because of the stretch so from under boob to shoulder you need a lot less than you think if you want to haul those chachas up! I got drunk, I got sweaty, danced, jumped and all the fun things...stayed til I made a conscious and valiant effort to remove. I will say I had some abrasion from the tape but I also have super sensitive skin. 10/10 recommended

  This is my second order for this boobie tape. I am a 42 yo woman, size 14 with D cups.  I would definitely recommend and plan on ordering again.A few key notes to consider:Pros:- Strong adhesive- Tape is very stretchy and flexible- Used 3 strips for excellent hold; 2 strips for good hold- Used enough tape to go about an inch under my boob to about an inch over my shoulder- Used the nipple petals and they are comfortable. They have a sticky adhesive but it's not super strong so  doesn't hurt to take off. - Lines on the back of tape so you know exactly how long to cut for each strip to be even - Held up to dancing and a night on the town (6-8 hours) Could definitely go longer. - Does not hurt to remove. It's not completely painless but it's easy. Like a band-aid.Cons: - Leaves a slight sticky residue after removal - I was able to get 4 uses out of the roll. Again, I have D cups and each strip was long enough to cover about an  inch under my boob to around an inch over my shoulder. I used 2-3 strips per boob per use. Make sure you  order more than 1 if you plan on using often. - This isn't really a con but you have to be very careful when applying. The adhesive is very sticky and if you  peel the back of the tape too fast or don't apply slowly, the tape stretches so it will retract and expand,  sticking to itself.

  I loved this product. Me being big breastfed all my life I took certain things out of my wardrobe. But this tape allowed me to wear a deep v cut jumper and forgetting I even had the product on. So comfortable easy to remove i didn't need the oils that was recommended and didn't leave any scaring or residue .. thumbs up across the board

  This tape is amazing!! I have a large bust and opt to wear a bra with everything. Needless to say; not wearing a bra was freeing. I advise a practice run before going out because the process is a little frustrating at first. I wore the tape in 100 degree Texas heat during an outside wedding and it didn’t budge. The removal process requires patients. I used baby oil. Stand in the bath tub and completely saturate the tape with the baby oil and let sit for about five minutes. When pulling the tape off, firmly hold your skin and gently pull the tape away from the skin. It’s a process but I think it’s worth it. Five stars for sure!!

   We really like this rope both adults and kids get to use it, doesn’t tangle and it feels great in your hand. At first we struggled figuring out how to adjust the length, I’m attaching a short video to this review to show how to adjust the length. One of the caps fell off while my son was using rope at the park and we could not find it :(  make sure to tighten all end caps every time before jumping.

   I literally have only used this rope maybe 6 times.  I got it only 10 days ago and it is already torn up. It is not durable at all and began to mess up on the 1st use. Also, the handles unscrew while jumping from time to time. I had to tighten them every time I used it. As you jump the handles somehow unscrew slowly. I am really disappointed cause I love how the rope feels when I jump with it. It is just cheaply made.It may work better for those who have the ability to jump rope in doors on a carpeted or hardwood floor.

  After my jump rope went bust with the ball bearings no longer spinning fast, I took a chance and ordered one from Amazon.  This has got to be the best jump rope I've ever used.  It's fast, inexpensive and easily adjustable.  If you're tall like myself at 6'4, this rope in my opinion is pretty much set for that height.  I would definitely recommend this jump rope.

  I actually bought this for my 7 year old daughter who has recently become a fanatic of jump rope. I love that the length is adjustable and the extra you can tuck inside the handle, so if anyone else at home wants to use it we can easily adjust the length. It is light weight and the handles are really amazing. Made to be soft and able to grip easily even if sweating.

  Really nice, very comfortable handles. A little difficult to adjust the length, but otherwise, a great jump rope. After a couple uses and the red has started to stretch a little, so I'm not certain how long these will last. For that price however, these earn its 5 stars.

  The handles are not as huge as the look on pictures, they are normal. The metal cable makes a huge difference for the durability it will last longer than the grip. It is easy to shorten the length, easy for beginners since I learned how to jump rope using this one but if it hits your leg it will sting (the only drawback of the metal cable).

  Wow. I just received this yesterday (last night to be exact) and put it on right away. I felt relief in my upper back/shoulder blades immediately. I personally didn’t think it changed my appearance until I walked by my husband wearing it under my hoodie, and he told me I looked different. “Good different” he clarified.The instructions say to start wearing it for a short amount of time and work up because it can be uncomfortable. I wore it the night I received it for an hour, and the discomfort I felt was mostly under my armpits, but it wasn’t unbearable and definitely worth that for the immediate change and pain relief.Background on me: I’m 5’3”, 130lbs, medium build. I’ve had large breasts and bad posture since I was 14, which caused neck and upper back pain.  I was a year-round swimmer for years, so I have broad shoulders that are still kind of awkward to me even after years of not swimming competitively. I’ve seen a chiropractor every week since high school for my neck and back pain, which helped but never fully alleviated the discomfort for long enough to skip a week.UPDATE! 1/3/21I had been wearing this brace almost every day since I received it, but now I am able to use it less and for less time. It’s more like a refresher when I feel like I need it.The first couple weeks after I received it, mychiropractor told me my neck wasn’t in dire need of an adjustment (as it has been, every week, for years). He actually asked me the same of the brace because of the difference it made in my posture and neck. My entire family couldn’t believe the difference (even my sisters across the country ON FACETIME)! They all asked for this for Christmas. So now my whole family has one!This product really worked (and is continuing to work) for me and now, my family. It can be uncomfortable (still is rough on my armpits), but after suffering so many years of excruciating neck pain and migraines, it’s worth it. I am amazed that after a couple decades of bad posture, this brace was able to help me so much in less than a month!

  ComfyBrace posture corrector really saved my sore back. After years of continuing on with the day to day comings and going’s in my life, posture naturally fell to the back of my mind. I hunched as I played with my children, I slouched as I folded laundry late at night, and bent down countless times to pick up toys and garbage from the floor. I was so busy taking care of all the things that seemed so important and my back silently came along for the ride. Until one day it didn’t. I woke up one morning and my entire upper back was burning, years or wear and tear began protesting. I was in so much pain, I couldn’t figure out what to do with myself. It was my grandson that suggested that maybe a posture corrector would be the solution. Thankfully amazon was able to deliver it the next day, and I immediately began wearing it. I can’t say magic happened over night, but I followed the instructions exactly, and the more I wore it, the more it became second nature for me. I still wear it for an hour each day when I do my yoga exercise, and I feel the difference the whole day.Now I am on top of my children, making sure they either wear a posture corrector or concentrate on their posture throughout the day. I don’t want them to suffer like I did.I will order a second corrector to wear while the other one is in the wash.It truly lives up to its name. It’s truly Comfy. The material is soft so it doesn’t hurt me, but it’s sturdy enough to maintain straight posture. It is adjustable so it can fit practically anyone, from my petite daughter, to my grandson who’s a basketball player. It looks like it’s pretty well constructed and can withstand quite a bit of regular wear and tear.I highly recommend this ComfyBrace posture corrector to people of all ages. Young ones take advantage before it’s too late, and the older fellows take advantage of the pain relief this will provide.

  I just got my brace yesterday and wore it for about half an hour, so that's where I'm coming from with this review.My family have noticed my poor posture lately and have been commenting on it, so I've ordered a new chair for my home office, a lumbar support cushion for my chair at work, and this thing for when I'm not at either.I've got a large torso and wide shoulders, so I wasn't sure how long the straps should be; eventually I decided to put them on with only slightly lengthened straps from the default. They're elastic, and fairly strongly so, and they held my shoulders back in the proper posture without trouble. My family noticed immediately that I was standing straighter, so clearly they're doing the job, and there wasn't any noticeable discomfort from the relatively tight straps.The seller recommends wearing them for short periods until you get used to them, and I can see why: I wore them only half an hour because my shoulders were getting sore.The fact of the muscle soreness suggests that my body is actually doing some of the work to hold my shoulders back (probably unconsciously), and that's good news: it means my rear deltoids will actually be tightening up over time while wearing them, improving my posture even without the brace on. I don't think this is the ideal solution for poor posture - barbell exercises for the chest and upper/lower back are the best solutions - but for anyone without time or access to a gym this is at lesat a reasonable alternative.I can't say how well this would help people with longterm injuries or chronic pain, as I don't have either, but at least as far as a single wearing this product seems to be exactly what its advertised to be. I'll update this review in a month or so, after I've worn it more.EDIT: I've now had the brace for two weeks, and I can safely say that its much more comfortable to wear for longer periods now than it was at the beginning. I've restarted my weightlifting regimen, so it's hard to say which has had more effect, but I've noticed myself automatically sitting up straight without having to consciously make myself do so. Obviously, this involves tensing muscles, so I have a little bit more soreness after long periods sitting with no back support than before, but that's been fading as I become accustomed to it.

  I am disabled with spine and joint problems and was looking for a low/no impact method to strengthen muscles. I ran across resistance bands and thought they looked like something that might work. I decided on this brand because they seemed to have the most basic features for the best price and had a good review rating. (I noticed when I went to write this review that the price has dropped several dollars!) This is my first and only experience with resistance bands, so I don't have any comparisons. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a set of instructions for different ways to use the bands, just a black and white page of drawings in different positions... however, I found tons online, so no big deal. It took a little getting used to, but once I got the weights (colors) and stances figured out I got exactly the kind of work-out that I have to have. My legs are getting a workout without harmful impact to my ankles, knees and hips. I was unpleasantly reminded how bad of shape I am in! I can only do about 10 reps right now, and I feel the muscle fatigue. Same thing with upper body, I have neck and shoulder problems, but with the bands I can customize the angles of stretching the bands so that I get a workout without neck strain. I'm sure I have a lot still to learn about stacking weights, etc., but I am still just a beginner. I'm starting to feel a little more energy and noticing some toning of my arms and legs. I'm glad I made the decision to try resistance bands. I wish they had used these while I was in physical therapy because they would have been perfect and I would have gotten used to the concept and versatility with a trainer instead of on my own.

  With gyms being closed and gym equipment getting resold for excessive amounts of money, I finally found a solution to staying active, safe, and healthy! I work 12 hour night shift and these exercise bands give me the opportunity to get some exercise in while I'm at work. The best part is that I'm able to work out a different muscle group every day. I honestly thought I wouldn't use these, but I've used them every night since getting them. The other best part is I don't need to lug around 5 different sets of dumbbells just to get 3 exercises done. It only takes about 15 seconds to add/remove/change the bands you're using. It’s so easy to install and the anti-slip handle makes working out even easier when you have a good sweat going! I definitely recommend this product to gain muscle and stay active.

  I'm a 8 handicap and was looking to buy some balls that I didn't mind playing when practicing and or when the drives are not going great.  I've used other cheap balls and other than around the green I can't tell much difference than the premium balls.  This one just lacks in all areas to me.And I'm not sure why it carries the ""distance"" logo.  I hit my normal ball at least 10-15 yards further than this hard ball plus it is pretty bad around the green.  It will stop with a lob wedge on soft greens like Bent, but on hard Bermuda greens, good luck.So for me, I definitely will not buy again even if cheap.  I bought two dozen and gave the last dozen away.
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade Distance Plus Golf Balls (One Dozen),$11.97,5.0,"
  First off, full disclosure--I'm not an experienced golfer, by most standards.  I've been playing for less than a decade.  As such, I can't say how many flaws there are in this ball's performance, because there's enough in my own game to make it impossible to know when a bad shot might be due to an inferior ball.  That said...I lose golf balls.  A LOT.  So it's not worth it to me to pay the premium price for the top-of-the-line balls out on the market, even when I can find them on sale.  So price was a major factor in my decision to buy these in the first place.  The other was the color...I'm slightly colorblind, so I lose white golf balls FAR too often...they get out about 150 yards or so and I just can't see them anymore, most of the time.There are cheaper balls on the market.  I know, I've tried them.  I like the feel of these better...I feel like I get better response off the club and better ball flight out of these than anything else I've tried in this end of the market (after playing these, the other, cheaper golf balls that I used to play with feel like I'm hitting wooden balls or small rocks by comparison).  And the color is immensely helpful to me in my game...these are not just yellow balls, this shade of yellow stands out more than most for me and makes it a lot easier for me to track my shots and find my ball.  I get comparable results from these that people I've golfed with are getting from upscale, premium-priced balls, so I'm really pleased with them, overall.My only complaint is, they aren't very durable.  Pretty much any time I end up in the sand with one of them, that ball has a permanent scuff from the shot to get back out (the one place where the cheaper balls I've played with hold up better).  But I typically wind up losing a scuffed ball a few shots later, anyway, so it's not like that scuff mark gets a lasting chance to mess up my game.I don't see myself changing to a new brand anytime soon.  Golf is already an expensive game.  Finding affordable, reliable golf balls helps a lot to keep it viable as a pastime.

  For the price point this is one of the best balls I have played. It's not a solid rock like Top Flite and other comparable  balls in this very low price range. Moderate spin and control around the greens with wedges. However it is a little lack luster when it comes to it's durability. Although if your looking at this price point durability generally isn't your concern.I would recommend this ball to anyone who is graduating from using batches of used balls and is looking for a more consistent feel to start lowering their scores further. However if your a ball snob lets be honest here, stop comparing  a 15$ value pack of balls to your 50$ pro V1's and giving them a 1 star review. These balls are great for the $$$$

  So, I head down to the park almost every day with my Labrador and hit golf balls.  I usually take an ""A"" wedge, good for about 90 yards for me.  I decided to take one of these new balls with me, and grabbed about 8 other balls and headed on out.  I hit the eight balls.  Typical distance.  I thought, well I don't think I'm going to lose it, and I dropped this one on the turf.  As soon as I hit it I'm like What? It just flew further.  About 5 yards.  I thought well this is an anomaly, and I did it again, same result.  This ball was further by about 4 yards.  I thought, well, let me do this one more time, and try to hit my other balls harder.  This time this ball about about 10 yards further, into the woods.  I had to go back with a ball retriever to get it, because my Labrador was right next to it and wouldn't get it.  Anyway, long ball.  I can't speak to how it is around the green.  I *suspect* it will be a little too hard. But not sure.  Anyway, for the price, and the distance, this is a no brainer.  Have fun.

  I received this combination of core and abs strengthening machine as a gift from my wife. It has surprised me with it because it is a combination of bench and rower. Rower could be also adjustable the front portion to be focusing on your biceps for gaining a bigger arms. You could also exercise sit-ups to tighten your abs for gaining a six packs. You could also lean back or adjust it to be a flatten bench for your chest workout. When you seat tight on it, it feels so comfortable and supportive for exercising. It is also easy to assemble when you follow the guidance. This combined core and row machine is definitely and highly quality duration and usages.

  I got this because the row machine was my favorite thing at the gym but I’m really impressed with how truly versatile it is. It was easy for me to assemble by myself in under 20 minutes and comes with a dvd on how to use it. It’s truly a full body machine.

  Great product. I used to go to gym which cost me $120 a month and 30minutes driving back and forth. Now instead spending that amount of money and time, I do exercise at home using this bench. It really helps me to do all the position I need to do to train my arms. I am very satisfied with its design and price. The package includes a Allen wrench that will help you assemble the bench and trust me it is not a hard task to do. The beach stay durable, no shape changes or strange sounds come out. I am having the feeling that it will stay with me for a good long time.

  I bought this in March of 2017 and really enjoyed it - simple, easy to assemble, compact, and adjustable resistance. I used this at least 3 times a week for ~30 minutes each time, never to crazy or intense. Well today, 10 months later, it unexpectedly broke while using it causing me and the machine to almost fall over. I am well under the max weight of 250 lbs, always kept a steady pace, and followed the directions provided with it. I'm relatively disappointed because I really enjoyed this and was able to lose some weight and build some muscle, but I expected it to last longer than it did. The cable attached to the wheel and peddles at the bottom - which looks like twisted metal cord inside a plastic casing - has snapped and has made the machine unusable.

  This stepper was pretty easy to put together and doesn't take up a lot of space. I lived in a 1-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and we had the stepper in there for about a year, and it fit perfectly. I have noticed that only after a few months or so, the stepper started to squeak when my girlfriend or I would use it. It didn't bother us a whole lot so it still squeaks, but I imagine a bit of lubricant would fix the squeaking, so I would recommend getting some if a squeaky stepper would bother you. I have also noticed that the handle bars can move around a bit when you are using it, too, but they don't seem to be in any danger of falling off or breaking. Otherwise, this is a great way to get some more exercise in the comfort of your own home, while not sacrificing a lot of space. I highly recommend this stepper, especially for the price.Update July 7, 2019: Well, the stepper broke today. :( I have attached pictures of the damage. It was doing fine and I didn't realize there was a problem until the stepper pads gave out as I was using it today. There is a tension cord that connects the two stepper pads and lets them go up and down opposite of each other as you step, and the left side of this cord seems to have rusted through and broken, and now the air pumps under each stepper pad will still hold them up if I lift them up with my hands, but when I step on them they both just deflate and do not go back and forth in a stepping fashion. I checked the order date, and I ordered it on February 22, 2017, so it would have come two days later (I have Amazon Prime) and I remember setting it up not long after it arrived. The latest I would have had it set up and started using it, then, is March 1, 2017, so it hasn't even been 2.5 years and it broke. :( Most of it still seems good except for the cord, so I will see if I can find a replacement cord or fix it somehow. I will update this review if I can find a fix for it, otherwise I am currently detracting two stars. This is a great little stepper if it is going to last years and years, but if I am going to have to be spending $50 on a replacement stepper every 2-3 years, it is not so great and I would probably recommend saving money and either just finding a set of stairs near you to use, or purchasing a small step-stool and using that as a ""stepper"". After today, I can unfortunately no longer recommend this as enthusiastically, and would recommend looking for a cheaper, less complicated alternative, like a step-stool, if this is unable to be fixed. I will update this review if I find anything, otherwise you can assume I was unable to fix this and my recommendation to find an alternative holds.

  Stepper worked great for a month and the welding snapped right off. I contacted Sunny Health through email and they kept giving me a run around.  Asked me to send picture so I did. They said they cannot open the picture files. The pictures were taken with my phone and they are normal jpeg files. I took more pictures with same phone and sent them again. This time they said they cannot see where the break was on the pictures. I took 20 more pictures from all different angles and resent them.  About 3 weeks after I initiated this process they finally said they will send thereplace parts.  This was 4 months ago and I have not received any parts.... I highly recommend buying a different company's product than Sunny Health & Fitness.  Bad product and worse customer service.....

  I purchased this at the beginning of January 2017, and today it broke (May2017). The tension cord snapped. I'm 5'7"", 150lbs, so not likely due to my weight.Also when you raise tension,  The calorie counter does not take that into account. Additionally there's no way to enter your weight and have a calculate it thoroughly. I would say it's just a random guess.

  We wanted a stair-stepper, but didn't have space for a standard one. This solved the problem.  We tuck it in a corner that measures 20 x 20 inches and bring it out when we're ready to use it... it's that easy to move!  It may seem a little ""tippy"" due to its light weight, but that goes away as soon as you put your weight on it. It's really remarkably designed and well constructed. It will have you breathing hard in a few minutes, and the resistance can be adjusted to increase your level of exertion. Due to its small size, it may not be perfect for a large man. But if you're average sized and need a stepper but don't have space for a big one - this is a great quality product for a reasonable price.

  I am a 65yo woman and bought this to strengthen my legs and knees.  I love it!  It is small and compact enough to stand in my bedroom.  It was easy for me to assemble, had it up and running in about 15 minutes.  I use it several times per day and even on the weakest setting is challenging but I expect to be able to increase the tension soon.  I highly recommend it!

  My husband put this together for me.  He said it was pretty easy. Did not take long.  Must say step is short if you do not want to keep hitting the metal bar on bottom.  Do not like how it feels to hit the bottom.  So I try to avoid it and thinking it would be easy, no way.  Its a workout. Hubby told me to start out slow.  Not to go to fast at first.  So I watch TV , go a slower pace and really feel it in my calves.  Even loosing the tension, it is not easy, but do I really want it too easy.  I want to loose weight and watch my shows and exercise.  I would buy it again.

  I suffered for many years from a severe case of carpel tunnel syndrome.  It probably all began because I work for a commercial designing company, and I spend about 8-10 hours a day doing 3D rendering on the computer, which entails a lot of using the keypad and mouse. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with tingling in my hands and sometimes with severe pain. I spent many restless nights twisting and turning in bed.I was advised by my Dr. to try wearing a night brace, and desperate to find a solution to the endless pain I stopped into my local pharmacy to pick up a handbrace from a big brand. I wore it for a few weeks and didn't see any difference, the pain at night was still severe and sleeping at night was almost a thing of the past. Nothing was working until I bought this comfybrace.After using this brace for one night I realized this was really making a big difference. I right away saw major improvement. After months of not being able to sleep at night I started getting a couple of hours of shut eye in a row!! This was a major breakthrough for me. Now that i'm wearing it for two weeks, night pain is a thing of the past. I thought surgery was my only solution, but maybe this is an easier solution!!!This comfybrace is made of durable material which makes it very soft yet sturdy and therefore my hands weren't sweaty from it. Another thing which was very important to me was the super soft and comfortable cushioning beads by the palm. The beads are soft enough that they got molded to the shape of my hand and hold my hand perfectly in that position.My hands are pretty average size for a man, and this glove fits me perfectly!! This brace is really adjustable so it would probably fit most hand sizes, including pretty slim hands and husky ones too.This brace is also made of very high quality materials and is stitched together very strongly. I can see that this will really last me a while. You can also see the picture I have attached showing the high quality stitching.I highly recommend this brace, and it's definitely worth the money. It's not worth  wasting nights when there is such an easy and affordable solution available.Thank you so much Comfy Brace!!!

  I am an RN and have severe issues with carpel tunnel for a very long time that wakes me up frequently from sleep and causes pain when trying to lift or crochet. In fact many nights, the pain is unbearable with numbness in my fingers and stabbing burning elbow and wrist pain. I have tried many braces before and while some have helped, most have been too uncomfortable to wear at night so I have not been consistent in using them. I was hesitant to buy another one, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give this one a try. The first time I put it on I knew it was different with the padding and overall comfort. One of my biggest issues was most other braces felt very warm and making my arm feel clammy and hot, and being from South Texas, I don't want anything making me feel warmer than we already are. I slept all night that first night and most other nights since using it. While I know a brace wont eliminate the problem completely, I recommend this brace for anyone dealing with this painful and annoying issue especially during flare ups of the condition and symptoms. I am getting another just to have for travel as I am very impressed with this product. Whoever created this must have had the issue of carpal tunnel and been frustrated with the current braces on the market and fixed them!! Bravo to you!!

  In the past year or so, I've started twisting one hand and wrist under my head as I sleep, which results in hand swelling and pain when I wake up. My doctor suggested wearing a brace to discourage me from twisting my wrist as I sleep.Well! Easier said than done! I tried two or three braces before this one. One was okay to wear but barely provided any support and did not prevent the twist. Another gave firmer support but was so uncomfortable that I removed in in my sleep (yeah, lifelong sleepwalker here).So then I tried the Comfy Brace. I was a little dubious since it does not come in a right or left hand version, the brace will fit either hand which I thought might mean it would not fit well. I was sooo wrong.Wowza, it works a charm! The three straps provide a more customisable fit so it can be firm enough to discourage the twist but still comfortable enough that I leave it on in my sleep. The cushion full of beads is brilliant--I put it on, wiggle my fingers once or twice, the beads shift into position and I honestly can't feel the metal support (part of the problem with the uncomfortable brace was that the end of the metal support tended to dig into my palm).It has definitely helped my wrist and hand without being uncomfortable at all. It fits like it was made specifically for my hand. Either hand! I've only used it for a couple months, so I don't know yet how it will last (still feels like new). If I ever wear it out, I'll buy another. No more experimenting, this is definitely the perfect design for me.

  Allows for hands free workouts. Can run with my music, water bottle, and car keys. The strap is adjustable. I have a 31” waist.

  I went on a cruise in December and used the fanny pack on the ship as well as the excursions.  I use my phone when on deck to take pictures and if I wanted my hands free, the phone fit well in the fanny pack.  On the excursions I had room for passport, money, 2 credit cards, Chapstick and phone (room to spare).  The pack did repel water but it also survived an accidental dunking.  Things got wet but I was able to dry everything.  Grateful passport was in waterproof sleeve.  Friend had my phone to take picture.  Sneaky wave got me...LOL

  I have suffered with cystic hormonal acne on and off for years. My first wave of acne was when I went through puberty. It randomly went away only to reappear when I turned 20. Now at 24, it’s calmed down somewhat but I still get breakouts & these bandages are life savers. They have a gel like feel that acts as a scab to promote healing. I wash my face at bedtime. I don’t put any lotions or serums on after my face is washed because I feel the bandages work better with a bare face. Then, I put them where my breakouts are. They are not uncomfortable, and I don’t feel them so I can wear them all night. As you can see, the two white dots are where my breakouts were & these bandages literally pulled out all that gross gunk. When I take them off in the morning, my breakouts appear smaller and they heal quicker. People have talked about how they hurt to peel off. I just grab a towel and wet it with warm water and soak them until they peel off gently. Highly recommend for anyone. They are also great for cuts, burns, etc. Happy healing 😊

  These are great! I use them most often on my elderly mother. Stays on securely for days or even weeks if appropriate.  Nice environment for wound to heal.  Have used over mosquito bites that I have scratched too much! Keeps my hands off and the itching soothed. This small size is not as good for sores on feet because it gets pushed around from friction.  The larger size stays in place.

  These were great, at first... stuck on nicely, did not peel up at all at the edges when in water, and I was using them for a burn that felt much better and protected under the bandage. Then, about 12 hours in, I started to get itchy around the bandage edges. Then swelling. Little hard bumps. It's been 24 hours since I peeled off the bandage and it is less red and itchy, but still not better -- another day perhaps. What a huge disappointment. I needed these, and now I have no bandages to use.

  The kayak was a Christmas gift for my 3 boys. We live in Ohio on an 8 acre pond. I blew up the kayak in May since the weather is nice. There is a large hole in the bottom of the kayak right next to the seam. Because of the location of the hole it is impossible to patch. I contacted Intex and they refuse to accept a return and replace the kayak. The warranty is only for 90 days. Do not purchase this kayak. It's worthless junk.

  This kayak was great the first five times we used it. The sixth time, as we were inflating it, it began hissing and a small hole appeared in one of the seams in the top of the floor. It was a huge bummer because we had driven from Washington DC to Lake Powell in Utah to kayak, and this happened the first time we took it out to go on the water. : (

  I bought this for me and my family to use on a camping trip, easier to haul than a plastic kayak. My expectation was low, I have bad luck with inflatable rafts and such. I had the attitude that if it lasted the 5 day trip and kids enjoyed it I would get my money worth.  This is so worth the $94!  I had 4 kids in it most of the week, the were jumping out in middle of the lake and swimming.  The kids range up to 16 years old and say it’s very easy to get in and out of.  As a matter of fact the 4 tried to tip it in middle of the lake by leaning one way and they were not successful!  It turns on a dime, the skeg is impressive for an inexpensive inflatable boat, I did not attach mine like some suggested and had kids dragging it in and out of the water with no problem.  Paddles are a bit short for an adult but it’s easier for an adult to paddle with a short paddle than a child to use a long paddle so they (intex) did well considering.  Personally I think the seats are a little low but I sat on my lifejacket and that made me feel better!  For inflatable seats they are comfortable and supportive, if you sit on something for height the backrest is too low too really lean on but I tend to sit up when I paddle. When I was out in middle of lake I easily turned around and sat on the floor and leaned against the front and put the backrest to my seat down and stretched my legs out so I could face my other half and chat while enjoying a cold drink….it was great!

  For under 100 dollars this kayak was a great purchase and highly recommended. Unfortunately, after about 5/6 uses a small air hole has appeared in the top of the bottom section at one of the seems. I have read reviews that it comes with a repair kit, but did not receive one and have reached out to Intex to see if they will send me one (will update if they do). You get what you pay for, so as long as your repaired to patch some tiny holes (size of like a needle) here and there this is worth the 90 dollars, but I would not recommend paying hundreds of dollars for this product due to how common this appears to happen based on other reviews.Overall, its easy to inflate and fits two full size adults (I am 6' 2"" 190 pounds). Its also pretty comfortable for what you pay.  Takes about 10-15 minutes to inflate and would suggest inflating near the water as its a lot easier to carry in a bag. My only other suggestion would be to send it in a better bag.. the bag completely ripped apart the first time using it and could not have been made any cheaper. If you buy this invest in a bag to carry it.

  The adjoining vinyl top seam on each side can scrap your hands frequently when you roll.  I was concern that I may get cuts like those you get from papers, but they only irritate so far after three rides instead of causing real cuts.  I like the stable ride the kayak provides and the safety of three main air chambers.  I feel pretty safe and secure.  Initially, I thought the oars are too short as the kayak is pretty wide in the middle section where the rear passenger paddles.  After some adjustments to my strokes, they seem to work adequately well.

  My wife and I plan on taking this to Florida this winter and wanted to test it out before we took it with us. We have ocean going kayaks, but they are heavy and must be carted on the roof so we were considering taking this kayak instead. We were expecting it to be difficult to inflate, but the little hand pump worked quickly and efficiently. We expected the paddles to be cheap and shabby but they were sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble. We took it out into a lake and had a great time. It was comfortable and sturdy enough to make us feel safe in aligator territory .

  It works well, but it sits higher in the water than we like. The kids struggled a little to maneuver because of this.  It did hold a lot of weight. My husband & brother are over 350 pounds and it still help up well.  We did send it back though & purchased another paddle board.

  First, the seats placed me so low, I had to buy additional cushions so I could paddle without rubbing my arms on the sides.Second, it got a pinhole on a seam, after the second use. We were very careful with use, transportation, and storage, so I believe it was a manufacturing flaw. I was able to patch it, though.Third, on the fifth time using it, it got a large, unrepairable gash on the bottom.This thing was WAY more trouble than it’s worth, and far too fragile. We only used it on the intracoastal waterway, at high tide, and babied it. Nothing rough at all.

  I love this brush. I can use it for the scrubbing of anything honestly, but I prefer to save it for bottles, pitchers, large bowls, etc. I use glass water bottles, they have a very small neck and I know that the dishwasher does not clean them properly . This brush gets into the bottle and makes it sparkle inside and out. I have a pitcher that is square with a small neck too, plus a handle that the liquid fills up. It was like a rubiks cube trying to clean it out, with this brush everything changed. The handle bends just enough I can get into the corners of the pitcher, into the handle area, and most importantly under the handle. Best day ever cleaning my various liquid holders properly.  I am VERY vigorous, and I have super strong arms , so if this brush has held up for a year for me it will hold up for anyone.

  It's a bottle brush. It has a good grip. The handle is long enough to be useful. It's better than rubber-banding a sponge to the end of a salad fork for cleaning coffee travel mugs, (my previous method).

  If I could give it 6 stars I would!  Coming from my wife who wanted a new bottle brush, this is huge!  Many of you who have read my reviews know that we have 4 special needs children in our home.  My wife constantly is looking for things she can make all natural with few ingredients and fresh ingredients.  This involves a lot of cooking for her while I am at work.  With a lot of cooking, comes a lot of cleaning.  She makes her own organic almond milk that she puts in a glass bottle to store in the fridge.  well in 2 to 3 days when it is empty, it has a nasty film on the inside.  It has been very challenging to get this film off the bottle and have the bottle cleaned and ready for the next batch to go in.  I know the challenge as I frequently assist with cleanup.  We never could get it completely clean  UNTIL NOW.  this OXO bottle brush is stiff enough yet soft enough, and it lets you reach the bottom of the bottle no problem.  the Grip on the handle is very good on my wife's often sore hands.  The handle end has a hole thru it so we were able to use an S hook we had laying around to hand it up to store and for sanitary drying purposes.  We will be using this a lot and are so very pleased with the product.  Fair price, product as described BETTER then described. We have solved our dirty bottle problem and anticipate this brush to last a very long time.  Great product!

  I have a drawer full of brushes. But this one is the best. I like everything about this bottle brush.It has more bristles than my other bottle brushes making the washing easier, faster and much more thorough.I wash a lot of bottles. My other brushes make my wrist hurt. Not this brush.The grip on this brush is thicker with good texture. It's not slick or slippery like a hard plastic or metal grip.It fits comfortably in the hand. The handle has a hole for hanging the brush up.OXO put a lot of thought into the design of this brush.I recommend this product.

  I bought this item to help transition back into a shoe following fractured 5th metatarsal and I wear a size 9 women’s shoe.  The brace is too small.  The straps that wrap the foot are adequate but the area for your heel is way too small and the ankle straps barely met around my ankle.  I tried wearing it for a few hours and it was way too tight, caused swelling and was painful.  In addition the brace was too thick and bulky to wear under a shoe.  I am returing it.

  This ankle support brace rocks! I have been recovering from a fractured ankle and have been beside myself as to what kind of brace or bandage I can wear to give me support and also act as a compression. This also needed to fit under my tennis shoe so I could wear it wherever I went. I couldn’t fit compression socks over my foot, and they were so very tight anyway. And all other ankle braces wouldn’t fit under the shoe. So for weeks and weeks I wore ace bandages which didn’t really do the job either. VOILA! This fantastic ankle brace does it all! It gives me really good, controlable compression and also supports my ankle AND goes under my tennis shoe comfortably! Yay!!!

  I have small feet, size 5-6 depending on shoe width. The get the brace tight enough, it gapes around the heel hole on the sides, so the foot can't get in or out of a shoe. It is also thick enough on the bottom that it bothers my arch and makes that foot slightly higher, so it's uncomfortable to walk in even without a shoe. For a person with small feet to wear this in a shoe, the material would have to be less thick, and the wraps shorter (they wrap around and around my foot).That said, I bought this brace to wear when I sleep because for some reason I pronate one foot during the night and wake up with ankle pain. The brace works just fine for sleeping purposes, eliminating morning ankle pain so I'll keep it. The company needs a scaled down version of this for customers with small feet who want to walk while wearing it.

  Good product and I do appreciate the support it gives AFTER I finish up the at the gym. It certainly reduces my ankle pain after running and working out, but the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because it will not fit into my shoe so I can workout with it on. For reference, I am a 6 in women's.In light of this however, the company reached out to me and while also letting me know they are working on a brace to fit smaller feet, they also wanted to let me try another product since the ankle brace didn't work out for me. I gave them a 5 star afterward for their excellent customer service, and will be sure to leave nice feedback for the calf braces I will be receiving as the complimentary product. I certainly would recommend giving Bodyprox a try.

  The Velcro secures well and it's easy to wrap around your foot, especially if you have pain or can't flex your foot into a sock. We used it for getting around with a cane throughout the day after a minor foot sprain and less frequently as support in a low impact exercise class. It was worn about 8 to 10 hours per day the first week. The heel opening began to ravel and wear after about 2 weeks of pretty frequent use. We ordered the large and it barely fits a women's 8.5. Order up a couple sizes.

  Even though I measured around my ankle the way the description told me, it does not fit around my ankle.  Bodyprox stands behind their products, though, so just be sure you measure carefully and then work with them if it doesn't measure up.  I am VERY PLEASED with their customer service.

  I would include a pic but I'm at work LOL. Okay so I've worked for plastic surgeons I've seen so many fajas (waist trainers) in my day i cant even tell you how many. This is by far the best, why? Because it legit makes you SWEAT without even working out because of the material its made of. I am  wearing it at work under my clothes for the sweat properties. All bodies are created differently, so to tell you my height and weight MIGHT help you but we all hold weight in different places and my torso is super long-because of that I got a large because i wanted to be able for it to cover all the way down to my lower belly  and it DOES, i will prob get a medium next because its a bit on the larger side but overall I'm super happy, and i plan on seriously losing weight with this. I haven't even tried the sweat gel that comes with it yet because i don't even need it. For the record i am my highest weight ive ever been at 177 and 5'5 soooooo i got a large but i know if you realllyy wanted it to be super tight you can get away w a medium, it just might not cover your lower belly if your torso is long like mine. Great buy!!!

   So I’ve been using the sweet sweat band WITH and WITHOUT the sweet sweat cream thing 5 days a week for 2 weeks.One: the cream (IMO) is not necessary. You sweat just the same.Two: YOU DEFINITELY SWEAT!Three: after a lot of use (I wore it twice a day for about half an hour each time) it started to roll down.It would’ve gotten a 5 if it weren’t for the rolling down after only a couple weeksDisclaimer: I lost inches and weight not with JUST the band....I changed my eating habits and exercised 2 times a day.

  First I’ll start off buy saying it worked and made me sweat more but after about two weeks, it gave me a horrible rash that spread from my stomach and back to my neck and arms also.please be carful when purchasing this item. Some others also said it happened to them too. Read the other reviews.

  I ordered it to help flatten out my tummy, I put it on to get the feel just around the house, and I started to notice I had better posture and I could feel my hips, ribs, and back align. At first it was a bit uncomfortable, but I am very large breasted and have horrible posture. Once I took it off I felt heavier. Meaning I began putting it on more because it made me feel better. I noticed my breathing even felt easier. I haven't used it yet for the sweat part,  but I would buy simply for the support part of it, and I bought it for tummy fat not having support being anything I would use from it.Now, when it came to size... I read the reviews looked at pics. I’m 5’4 and 160 pounds, short and built. A lot of the reviews said to order small. There were many body type 5’6 188 pounds tall and built, so I assumed I definitely needed a small. I wish I had gotten a medium, simply so I personally can cover more ground with it. I want to be able to wrap from under my bra down to my hips. Also, going a size up wouldn’t hurt simply because you can tie it how tight you want it.  The Velcro’s is extremely durable and it’s easy to put on and take off. I highly recommend this product, I would be writing my review on the weigh loss result, but I would order it for support purposes now. I didn’t realize how off my spine was until I got this. Other things become easier when you can breath and you’re body is positioned properly. Good luck!

  Love using this. It fits well and it doesn’t slide down. It stays on until I take it off. I sweat a lot while wearing it and I use the sweet sweat roll on application with it. Also it doesn’t take long for it to dry. Super plus it comes with a small net bag that you could roll it up and place it in. I recommend once you get home to hang it up to fully dry though so it doesn’t get super smelly

  I stumbled upon this waist trainer after seeing the sweat my sister would have after her work outs! Before placing my order I wasn’t sure what size to get so I took a look at the reviews & questions. I then saw someone asking what size do they recommend for a person who is 5’2 and about 200lbs, literally my description (don’t judge :( I’m working on it). Anyways I saw that they recommended getting an XL, so I immediately placed my order! Here are a few pics of the packaging and what is included. When you first see it out, you might think it might be too big for you but once you like actually put it on properly, it fits great! 10/10 def recommend!

  So I didn't follow the size guide which is my fault. If I had it probably would work a little better. HOWEVER, this is still an amazing waist trimmer. It is very durable and I use the sweet sweat stick along with it. Bother together certainly make me sweat. I tried using the waist trimmer from Walmart it wasn't long enough. I finally got so annoyed I decided to spend the money and get this one. After using it, my results are so much better and I am not annoyed through my entire workout. I would definitely recommend that someone buy this instead of the cheap ones. I am a very big girl so I thought I would get a bigger size. Turns out I should have just followed the size guide. So I will be buying a size smaller :) I also love how the velcro is smaller so it doesn't scratch you.

  I got this bottle when I was planning to do a summit attempt to Mount Rainer. I already had one which I sparingly used, but for this trip I needed 2 32oz ones. So I got this additional one. For purpose of mountaineering I need following:-- Large mouth so that even if it freezes a little , it still allows you to drink from it. Also easier to clean.- Use for keeping warm inside the sleeping bag after filling with hot water.- BPA free for obvious.- No leak since I need to put this inside my backpack.Overall it met all the criteria's below. At summit, 50% of the water was frozen but I was still able to use it without any issues. These bottle are durable, I even kept these in my check in backpack while taking the flight. No issues what so ever. The marking can be useful if you want to break it down. We took 5 breaks from camp Muir to summit and I was able to manage the intake considering 64 oz and tried to drink the appropriate amount using the markings. Also I did not feel any difference in taste keeping the water for longer duration. I will report back if I observe any more features or faults with this.**If you find my review useful then please click the 'Yes' in helpful.

  I've used my wide mouthed Nalgene for EIGHT years, every day at every job I've had. We were inseparable. All the lunches we had together, the late nights, early mornings, fears of bosses, laughing at co-workers...ah the joys we had together. I didn't even treat it that well, dropping it on concrete, down stairs, throwing it in my car, and not a single leak. One time I threw it in my car without the lid on all the way, and it reminded me gently with spilled water that I needed to tighten the lid. I've left it behind almost everywhere, but we always found each other. Until one work meeting, left it in the conference room. I'm guessing someone grew quite jealous of our affection, and swiped it! NOO! Truly an end of an era. There really was a connection here. Well 8 years of daily use later is a good enough review for me to come back and buy the same water bottle. :)

  The main reason I bought this was because I really like things that glow in the dark. I also wanted to drink more home filtered water instead of having to buy bottled water all the time. So this glow in the dark Nalgene water bottle helps me save money and saves the environment at the same time.I included a couple of pictures for more details. I used a regular sized Funko Pop for size comparison. Right before taking the picture showing the glow in the dark effect, I charged both objects using my 100 LED uv flashlight.

  I'll start off by saying that I've been using my Nalgene bottle daily for about 3 months. I've only put water in this bottle, and I only handwash it. I'm too much of a fan of the oz/mL label to throw it in the dishwasher. I imagine it would come off easily, and I like to see how much I'm actually drinking throughout the day.I've dropped this bad boy on concrete a few times, so yeah he'll get some scratches easy-peasy. But no cracks thus far, nor have there been any leaks. Also, the wide mouth is nice for when I want to put ice in my water.The major thing about this bottle is the cap attachement. I like how the plastic cap is attached to another piece of plastic which wraps around the ""neck"" of the bottle to keep the cap from rolling away, but that loop is definitely NOT a place to hold it from. I used to hang on to the loop while doing my daily activities, but I noticed it was becoming loose. Since then I've stopped, and everything has stayed in shape. I know other people got to the point of that breaking off.Other than that, I really like this bottle for the price. It's big enough to where I don't need to be refilling it constantly, but also at the right size to fit in my bag when I'm on the go. Its mere presence works wonders of reminding me to drink water since the blue color I got somehow makes water look... appetizing?ANYWAY... My suggestion to you, potential buyer of this particular Nalgene bottle, is to prepare yourself to transport this BPA free container by the body and handwash it as much as your annoyance of germs goes. But most importantly, stay hydrated.

  If you already have Nalgene, you know what you're getting.If you do NOT own a Nalgene, boy are you in for a treat. They're the best bottles. Once you use a wide mouth bottle, there's no going back. These are seriously tough bottles. For example, you can:1. Drive over them (big Suburban). Still held water.2. Drop them off of a 15 story building. Shhh probably not real legal.3. Store acid in them. Eh. Don't ask. NOT pee. Also not the drug. Chemistry, people.4. They can hold pee too, though....again don't ask.In addition, Nalgene bottles have a magical ability to cause stickers to adhere like a bug on a windshield at 80 miles an hour on a hot summer day.Go buy one.

  These are probably the best assortment of band-aids I ever purchased.  There is a variety of types, as well as a variety of sizes within each type.  I think the only box that is all one size is the 60 basic medium size bandages.The assortment includes sheer strips, water-proof, heavy duty, and everything from small rounds to larger bandages (for knee size scrapes).  Many of the bandages are also four side adhesive, so it grips on all four sides, rather than just two and buckling up when you bend a finger or arm.There are just 20 of the small dots, so this is NOT a 300 pack where 200 of the bandages are tiny.  It also has 30 treated (anti-bacterial) bandages.Absolutely going to purchase these again.

   I got these because of the wide variety, different shapes, sizes and every type bandaid for anything imagined was all in this box. This is a brand you can trust already but the price for 300 mixed varieties and kinds was what got me to buy this over just a litte 30 count box. Great savings for quality products.

  Gave it a 4 star review just because it leaves this “sticky goo” when I peel off the bandaid; other than that, it’s a really good variety of different types and sizes of bandaids for the price.I get cuts here and there at work, have a firstaid kit at work but all of the stuff they have in there are probably 30+ yrs old, so I decided to buy this to bring to work.Had two little cuts today so I decided to use the little round ones to stop the bleeding so I can keep working without worrying about leaving blood trails. Took them off to wash my hand, and found out it was a bit hard to peel off also it leaves this sticky residue on my skin and nail. (Which was a little hard to get off).But overall, can’t really complaint too much when it’s was pretty cheap for 300 of them in different types and sizes.

  All the boxes come color-coded for which type is inside, but every single bandaid is covered in the SAME GREEN LOGO. Sure, the shapes are different, but why not label which kind is inside?!?!? Now I have a box of assorted bandaids, but I have to guess whether I'm picking sheer or fabric or whatever.... It's such a pain and I wouldn't have ordered this variety pack, if I had known I'd have to choose blindly.

  I was irritated to say the least when this arrived in a Curad box as pictured that is much bigger than it needs to be, because it contains six or seven other boxes inside. I keep all my bandages in a container. When I went to put them into it, I realized the wrapper says nothing about the type of bandage inside. What's the use of having this huge variety if I can't tell before I choose if I am getting sheer, or plastic, or cloth, or antibacterial. So now I have a medicine cabinet full of boxes that take up far more space than needed. Back to Bandaid brand next time.

  I purchased this in August of 2015 and it has served its purpose well.  Assembly was easy.  If I remember correctly, it took me less than 30 minutes.  I don’t use it for anything else other than pull ups and chin-ups, but I’m sure it’ll be good for pushups and sit-ups.  I question how effective dips would be on this since it seems a bit too low to do a full movement dip.  It has handled my weight (145 lbs) well and has not started to bend or sag.  I do have a couple of complaints, the padding on the bar where it meets the door frame should be thicker.  Mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe.  Now my doorframe is damaged.  I recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection.  My other complaint is that the flat piece that goes against the wall above the doorframe could discolor your wall.  It did mine.  I recommend putting something in between the wall and the flat plastic part to prevent against this.  Other than that, this is a well built product that performs as advertised.

  The inside of my door frame width was too narrow for the bar to get a secure hold so I put on a couple of 1000 ply toilet paper rolls at each bar end.And if I ever find I'm out of toilet paper, I can always have a pair of extra rolls on the pull up bar.Perfect

  It doesn't fit every door and it won't work for me.  The molding above my doors is 1"" thick/4.25"" and that's too high--it appears this product was designed for smaller molding.  The top horizontal bar must rest *on top of the molding*; otherwise, it won't stay up when you're pulling up on it (while a lot of your weight will be redirected into the door frame, there's still a downward vector which the molding above the door absorbs).The photo demonstrates how the unit hangs, and I'm about 0.25"" shy of fitting.  Sigh.Also, this product probably won't work on anything other than flat molding: the top bar is only 0.75"" and probably doesn't provide enough offset for decorative moldings, which would probably get crushed.These size limitations aren't on Amazon's web site or in the manual, which I read before unpacked the product; this is clearly a vendor miss.  Other products from this vendor note a molding size restriction of 3.5"".Update: vendor contacted me and offered a completely satisfactory solution, so I'm boosting my rating.  Customer service matters!

  Terrible terrible materials for putting the product together. The product itself may be FANTASTIC, but if you can't even properly complete the assembly process, then it's useless. What should be the easiest assembly has wrong parts for doing so. As a result of NOT being able to properly tighten the bolts provide. The wall protecting plastic bar is made of poor material in which the bolts easily stripped the plastic when trying to even loosely tighten it. On top of that, there's no way of reversing the bolt tightening process (I was going to switch out the bolts for personal ones that contain a screwdriver access head so that you can hold the bolt in place on one end while tightening on the other...the ones provided don't allow for that) , but as a result of not having that, I can't switch out the bolt. This leaves me with a loose dangling arm, which basically means that I can't use the product. Not sure of anyone had this same experience, but I would suggest that Iron Gym switch out some of its assembly parts for more logical and sturdy materials.  Unfortunate bc I was looking forward to using this, and now I can't even return this product for a refund.

  Grips have come unattached to the frame after only 1.5 months, making product basically unusable in pull-up position.  However, that's beyond the warranty return date allowable, so all I know to do at this point is leave a negative review.  It would be nice if there was a way to contact the manufacturer.

  The device is GREAT for the first 30 days.. Which coincidently is also your 30 day money back period...  BUT after 30 days, AliveCor will cripple your device unless you pay $10 per month extortion fee..You are not allowed to save any EKG's to your OWN personal device.. you can only view the last one, provided you didint close it.. Once you exit out of the EKG, its gone forever... NO ability to save historñy!!!in order to save ANY EKG's on your device you must pay AliveCor $10 per month..This is a sham!  you pay $100 for a device AND you must pay $10 per month to use it..  They even block taking a screen shot of the EKG!!!  Total sham..Its like saying you can only view the last picture you took with your phone, but if you want to save any pictures to your own devices that you took with that device, you need to pay Google or Apple $10 per month to save photos on your phone..  Ridiculous!!-EDIT-  I wanted to edit my review and provide some good alternative product recommendations.  I have been using the ""SonoHealth"" EKG monitor for a few months now and I find this a  MUCH superior product to the Kardia..SonoHealth EKG Monitor is a standalone device that does not require a phone to record EKG's and provides immediate results on the own screen.. It features a rechargeable battery and color screen..SonoHealth app also allows you store infinite amount of EKG recordings WITHOUT any subscription!!  It also support MANY more diagnostic capabilities..In short - I would NOT recommend Kardia due its shortcomings and would instead recommend an alternative product like SonoHealth!

  The real issue is that when you download the app you have to agree to let them send you ads on their products and you have to let third parties send additional as well as allow them put put cookies on your device. They say you can opt out at any time but what they don't tell you is that you have to go to each third party individually to opt out and some do not have an opt out feature, sound transparent? They let you do one click to accept their terms and it takes hours to undo and even then it cannot be completely undone.Now for the device. It seems to work ok but, if you happen to be one who has a low resting heart rate, below 50, then each time you record your EKG you get an unclassified and they suggest you send it to them or your physician for evaluation, at a cost of course. They seem to sell this device to give third parties a right to collect your data, to sell you their products and to sell you their subscription so you can store and compare your data which seems like that is a part of the reason you buy the product. $120 a year seems like a steep price for such a simple process. Would not recommend this device.

  I bought Kardia Mobile, and by the time, I opened the box, the Return Product time had expired. And the product never worked from get go. I though it might have been the battery that came with the Unit, so I bought a new battery - that didn't work either. Now I am left with a Product that doesn't work, cannot return it (Since the return time expired). And when I go to Amazon site to get hold of the vendor, I seem to go round and round, not able to find, to whom I should report my problem,Once I realized I had a problem with the product,  I read the reviews written by other users, only to find out they had also realized that it has limited practical use as they have to keep paying monthly to have the historical data preserved.  The disclosure from the manufacturer is not too transparent, about having to pay $10 per month to have the data retained, unless I totally missed the fine print about it. As suggested by the manufacturer, I replaced the battery only to find out that that didn’t help. I would like Amazon to take control of contacting the manufacturer, and have my money returned, and also instruct me as to how I can return the product, postage free. Here are the details about the purchaseOrder Placed to buy Alivecor Kardia Mobile ECG for apple. Delivered July 5th 2017, Paid $99.Since, I have no use for the product, as it is defective, and even if it were to have worked, I am not willing to pay monthly subscription, I need to have my money returned. And I need Amazon to contact the Manufacturer to effect the return of the product.Thanks.

  This product seemed like a great instrument to add to my cardiac healthcare. However, all the documentation I have read, both on Amazon and on the company's website, does NOT tell you once you install the application on your phone, that a Cardiologist MUST read the first test before you can access the data. This is not what is advertised - it is advertised that this is a tool you MAY share with your cardiologist and keep track of your rhythm.  I am returning it due to the misleading advertising.

  The bands themselves seem great.  I like that each one says the weight on it so you're not just wondering what weight range ""light"" is or what weight range ""strong"" is.  However, just from getting the package out of the box, I was absolutely disgusted -  the woman on the front of the bag is horrendous and made me cringe.  Plumped up swollen lips, ultra-fake and mega-huge breast implants, and wearing pleather?  Seriously??  That's the image this company wants to promote for health and fitness??  Basically anyone else in their pamphlet would've been 1,000% better.  This type of body image advertising is NOT one I want to support so I will be returning these and purchasing from a different company.

  I've been using bands to exercise for years. I am a physical therapist assistant that gives band work to my patients. For 24 years I have issued bands to my patients that I know will roll and slip (I know this because I have also used them in the past).  These bands are the best they do not roll or slip. They are sturdy and there isn't any pinching on your skin. The resistance is the strongest I've had the pleasure to use. They are well worth your money! I especially like the carrying case. My last set of bands I purchased didn't have a case/bag and I've misplaced a couple of my bands. This is a good investment in your health.

  Very happy with these booty bands.  Well made with comfortable non-slip grips, in pleasant colors, and clearly labelled with their resistance level.  Came with a convenient mesh carrying case, and a card with a sample training routine on one side and exercise poses on the other.  Also comes with cleaning instructions (which comes in handy for super sweaters like me).Overall, compared with booty bands I've purchased in the past, I would highly recommend these booty bands to anyone looking to add them to their home gym.

  I have been on the hunt for good quality bands for quite some time. I started to look for material bands but every one I came across wasn’t stretchy enough to do hip abductions or fire hydrants. There is 4 different levels and a workout user guide. Once I received them I immediately knew I found the bands I was looking for. Super stretchy, high quality and even comes with a rubber portion on the inside so they don’t slip. I am a very happy customer.

  The bands arrived packed nice and neat.  Each band was packed separately. There's a little mesh bag to store them after use so they can all breathe properly.  There are two cards in the pack as well.  One for an additional 20% off the next purchase and one with instructions on how to use (including a workout plan) and also how to wash.  There is a QR code included to access instruction videos as well.These bands are not difficult to understand, but they are certainly a challenge to the thighs and booty!  They've kicked my butt, and I'm only using the light band consistently.  I'm so glad I purchased these.  My squats will be forever improved with the use of these bands.

  I love these leg bands. I'm a dude with hairy legs and I've tried using other bands which end up pinching my skin and hair (no bueno).These bands are great in that they provide the resistance I want without pinching my skin or leg hair.

  The problem with the zillions of sock reviews is that almost none of them tell you anything about the foot on which the sock ""fits great!!!!!"". Well, in my case the socks are stretched a bit too tight for my liking. I'm a somewhat narrow size 10.5. They're nearly sheer and squeeze my toes to an uncomfortable degree.They're a nice wicking synthetic, but they're very thin. Several have spots failing at the front of the toes. I'd have preferred a slightly heavier material that's not so elastic.

  These are garbage. They fall down the second you put your shoes on and take 10 steps. Dont waste your money or time. Target used to carry some very very good socks of this style and worked perfectly. I wore all mine out and have been looking for a replacement that actually stays on your feet. These are not it.  I donated mine. Complete waste of money. Hopefully someone that gets them finds them useful.

  I have been looking on Amazon for weeks for a solid pair of socks - after returning about 3 pairs, I finally found the ones.- These are almost true no-show socks with sneakers, which is so hard to find.  (Seen in picture)- Comfortable, padding on the bottom but thin on the top- Not overly padded, so my feet don't get hot- Thin top aren't too thin - I've had issues where the hair on my foot will get caught in some thin socks, not the case here.After confirming the quality holds up for a few weeks, I will be ordering a few more sets of these socks.

  Bought these because we’ve had shoes this brand that we’ve liked, and the price for 6 pairs seemed like a good deal. After a single wear and wash, the pilling on them is terrible and these socks actually look worse than the old ones they were intended to replace.  Would not recommend or buy again. Pay a little more for a different brand.

  Bought these based off the cheap price and the Saucony name, which is my running shoe of choice...well the saying you get what you pay for definitely rang true here. They looked and felt great when tried on new/fresh, a little thin but was happy for the price. Literally got to wear them once before they started falling apart...pilling, threads coming out, holes starting. Its really unbelievable, they are like wear once or twice and toss socks... every single pair in the pack has followed suit. Needless to say wont be buying again and find it hard to believe Saucony has anything to do with these other than granting its name (which it should think twice about)..

  I've been wearing expensive socks for a long time, wool, toe socks, athletic socks. Not sure if I'm allowed to name drop? Regardless, you name it, I've tried them. I've been happy with some, but never really blown away. I mean, they're socks. If they do what they're supposed to, you don't think about them. These saucony have that wow factor for me because I don't miss my expensive socks. They fit my size 10.5 wide feet, they vent well, stay in place, comfy padding, no bunching or noticeable seams. If I had paid $13 for a pair of these, I wouldn't be dissatisfied, but the fact that I got 6 pairs for less than the price of one pair from those other brands, that to me is icing on the cake.

  I was hopeful as I love Saucony sneakers.  I just can’t recommend socks that get holes in them after wearing them twice.  I wore them for 12 hours at a time in my Sketchers.  Out of the six pairs, 2 pairs already have holes.  The other 4 pairs are already breaking down.  I am a size 13 foot, but still, these should not have holes that quick.

  I ordered 12 pair of these socks and I'm happy at this price.  They are polyester and have two mesh panels in the top so they breathe well and don't hold a lot of moisture.  That makes them comfortable for running.  I did an 11 mile run in a pair today when the socks arrived and I had no blisters or hot spots and the socks stayed in place, no slipping.  The polyester also means they won't pick up odors as bad as cotton socks.As for fit, I wear a size 10.5 US in a dress shoe and a 11 US in a running shoe.  The fit is fine for me, not loose, not tight, comfortable.I like the fact that you get 6 pair all the same color.  I hate trying to match up socks coming out of the dryer.  I tossed all my assorted other running socks in the trash.  Now, I've got 12 pairs of running socks and any two make a pair.  If I'm fishing through a drawer at 6AM in the dark for black socks, any two will make a pair.You can't beat the value.  6 pair for $14 is great.  I've had good wear from polyester running socks before so I expect these to hold up well.  If I get 6-12 months out of a dozen pair  for $28 bucks, I'm not gonna complain.EDIT 12/19/2019: I just trashed the first 12 pair and bought another 12.  I can't believe I got 3 years out of the first dozen.  They held up well running 2 days a week, gym workouts twice a week, and general summer wear.  At the end a few still looked pretty good.  But for this price I figure if I get a year, I'm happy.  Three years is amazing.

  We love the game KanJam. It is a huge hit outdoors during family gatherings. We are buying it for a wedding gift. However, the game only came with the two tubes, one frisbee disc, sticker labels, and instructions. NO original KanJam BOX to store the game in when not in use. Since it is a gift, I would like to present it to the receiver in the original packaging, not an Amazon box. I am disappointed because the item falsely advertises the original box and parts in the displaye image.

  These are a joke for $39 bucks. A cheap, cheap, cheap, Frisbee and 2 plastic sheets rolls that hook into a cylinders that are too low to work properly because they are so thin and flimsy. For this price you can go by 2 small  garbage cans and have a way better product with a good Frisbee.

  I tailgate.  There, I said it.Living in California, I don't own the largest car.  I have things I got to get to the game.  Coolers, tables, grill, you know, stuff.  I have to choose what makes it into the Prius.  The car is friggin full.  I'd love to take a cornhole set, but there's no way it would fit.  So I bought Kan Jam as a similar game that takes up way less space.But here's why it's better, and I didn't know this before owning it.  When your teammate is throwing, you have to help.  You have to guide the frisbee.  In cornhole, you just kinda cheer and hope for the best.  In Kan Jam, you can save a bad throw by your teammate, or slam it home for the points.  It's way more of a team sport.Does it seem a little expensive?  Maybe, but those plastic cans hold up.  They've been through 12 home games and are still fully functional.  Will it bring you more joy than three $20 movie tickets?  Abso-effing-lutely.  If you're on the fence for a yard game, get this while you research plans to build your own cornhole set.

  This is a great yard game to add to my ever-growing collection. My friends and family love it, and it's a neat new concept for a me vs. you team game. The cans fold flat for easy storage, and the rules are very simple.My main complaint is that the included Frisbee is heavy and hurts your hand/fingers after awhile when you try to smack or deflect it out of the air. Also, it's very susceptible to any sort of breeze. I donated my kan jam disc to charity and instead substituted my trusty Aerobie 10"" Superdisc which flies much better in wind, is easier to control, and has nice soft edges which are much more kid and family friendly IMO.

  This game is super fun to play outside, but especially on grass or sand (which allows for players to make some epic dives in attempts to deflect the incoming disc thrown by your teammate).  You can also play on concrete but the disc will get scratched up pretty easily as it slides along the ground in the event of any far misses (which there will probably be a lot of for non-pro level players like myself).  My only gripe about the set is that it should come with a short bungee cord or something similar to wrap around the black plastic goals to make it easier to transport.  The box it comes in is supposed to be used as a carrying case but no one wants to lug around a bulky box to carry this game around!  The goals easily fit in a decent-sized duffel bag.  I got a bungee cord myself to wrap around them to keep it compact but it would have been nice if a cord were included in the purchase.  Anyway...Happy gaming!

  My nephews introduced me to this game and it is FUN! It's a team game so fun to get the whole family involved. Basically you have one member from each team by one of the ""goals"" the other member stands by the other goal and throws the Frisbee trying to get it into the goal basket. The teammate close to the goal basket hits the Frisbee to help it either go inside or touch the goal basket in order to get points for their team.  Then that team member throws the Frisbee back attempting to do the same thing with the other teammate trying to help the Frisbee go into the other goal basket.The number of points each toss can get depends on if the Frisbee goes into the basket without help, with help, or touches the goal basket with or without help.the first team to make it to 21 points wins.This is a great game for Summer!

  I am 5’2” ~125lbs and a 34B. I ordered both the small & medium to see which I would like better. Both fit me but the small was more compressive whereas the medium gave more of a relaxed fit. Specifically around the bust where the under bra elastic is and the straps on my shoulders. So honestly you can fit in your normal size and the one above, it just depends on how tight you want it to be! Other than that, the shirt is buttery soft & super flattering on!

  First of all the plastic is very hard to bend and I was afraid I was going to break it while trying to get the spiky part hooked into the bottom. I realize it’s got to be heavy duty plastic to hold people’s bodyweight but it is hard to get it into the groove.Once you get it set up, it feels so good on your back. I am an almost 40 mom of 3 so I am starting to struggle more with aches and pains. The stretch it provides me with reminds me of a traction table at a chiropractor’s office but not quite as good. My upper back is where I hold a lot of stress and therefore it bothers me far more than my lower back. This stretcher didn’t help as much with my upper back even when shifted further up. I didn’t realize how stiff my lower back was until I was laying on this! It felt so nice especially with my knees bent and rolling ever so slightly from side to side so the nubs would hit my whole lower back. I would definitely say this device works great for stretching your lower back out and relieving lower back pain. The spikes aren’t super sharp to the touch so there’s not pain caused by them. I’m still on the hunt for something to help with my upper back/shoulder blade pain but I will definitely be using this on the regular!

  So...this back stretcher really works, but be advised to start at the lowest curvature first. It may not look so menacing, but above the first level, there is a significant arching of the back during the laying on this thing and it can quickly cause discomfort. You need to work yourself up slowly to the 2nd and 3rd level of this device. It really works as well as an Inversion table. Great purchase and I highly recommend it

  Eases back pain and is very comfortable when I use it in the upright position while sitting on the couch and especially when driving. The support is adjustable depending on where and how you use the device. When using it laying down, start with the device in the lowest, thinnest setting and work your way to the higher settings as your back begins to adjust. Highly recommend the Back Stretcher to anyone with back pain.

  This was not the least nor most expensive Back Stretcher.  The unit I had bought in the past was no longer available.  Since I've used these for a three years, I feel confident in pointing out one glaring flaw.  The 'insert' is not tabbed at each end and therefore dislodges from the unit 'every' time it is used.  I purchased two of these and although I will not return them, find this oversight very frustrating.  This does affect the overall effectiveness of the stretcher, because any movement of the back causes the strip to pop out of the slots and shift.  The unit does provide relief, but must be used much more carefully.

  The board that needs to be bent and placed into the grooves of the bottom board is pretty stiff so the initial assembly is a bit challenging.Also, this is not exactly a miracle worker, I didn’t really feel any different in my back after a week of use, I think I’ll stick to the traditional foam rolling method.

  I love this product. I am a 40 DDD and I felt very secured. You have to clean you skin well to make sure that you don't have any oils or lotion on for a firm stick. I recommend if you have large  breast that you start from under the breast and pull up to couture your shape. This product is a bit difficult to put on but once you get it on how you like it, it sticks well and feels comfortable.

  This tape is a life saver!! I am bigger chested, I am a 36DD. I bought a few dresses in items for vacation, but wearing them without a bra made them look really awkward. The nice thing about the tape is that you can’t tell it’s on when you put it on a certain way. The only thing I would say is it could be a little bit hard to get off your skin, but it isn’t painful or anything like that. Then icing as you get nipple covers to help protect your nipples from the tape!! I would 10/10 recommend, and will purchase again!

  I really like this exercise mat! I am a regular exerciser and have gone through tons of mats. This one is definitely thicker than most, and also longer than most! That’s a plus because I’m 5ft9 and I sometimes feel like mats are way too short for me when laying down to do sit-ups or stretches. Unlike other reviewers, my mat came with absolutely so smell whatsoever, even when I have my face on it doing yoga. I got the red color and it’s vibrant and beautiful. The color does not transfer like some super-cheap mats I’ve owned that eventually stain my hands and knees when things get sweaty. I also love using this for cardio with jumps. It has great cushion for landing which is soft on the feet and knees. I also appreciate the extra padding when doing yoga poses like cat/cow because otherwise my hardwood floors really hurt my knees. While it does squish slightly and leave hand and foot dents momentarily, it quickly springs back to its normal shape. Some reviewers mentioned the extra padding being a nuisance when standing on your feet in tough-to-balance yoga poses like tree, but I have have absolutely no problems and it actually feels better on my feet than the hardwood floor or super-thin mats. It has good grip and doesn’t move around or slip even when barefoot. I really like that the ridges on the top of the mat run in parallel lines in only one direction, rather than being cross-hatched or bumpy. Mats with other patterns like that are much harder to wipe clean when dirt gets stuck in the ridges. I also appreciate the included carrying strap to keep it rolled up and to carry it around. Some reviewers complain that the mat is too big and bulky, but I like the thickness and length when using it, so of course it’s a bit bigger than the thin-as-paper mats when rolled up. Duh! Overall, another solid Amazon Basics product. Every Amazon product I’ve purchased so far has been of great quality for the price. Edit: see the photo of this red mat next to my old purple mat. It’s a couple inches longer than a standard mat and about 3x as thick!

  This mat is awesome! Im an extremely overweight individual trying to get fit and I purchased this mat in hopes of using it to do my floor exercises on, such as sit ups, instead of the bare, hardwood floor. This matter was PERFECT! I honestly wasnt expecting it to be as thick as it was! I was able to comfortably get down on the floor without my knees feeling like they were going break on the floor. Matter of fact, my knees didnt even touch the floor! I also love how its NOT memory foam. Memory foam sinks to your body's pressure and I wanted something that stay firm, but supportive and this matter is it!

  This mat is reasonably priced, but there are a few things I think potential buyers should know:1. You can't wear shoes on this matI learned this the hard way, after my sneakers scuffed up the mat after a workout session. I could probably have ended up tearing my mat if i continued to wear shoes while using it. Barefoot or socks only if you wish to keep it in good condition for longer.2. It's slippery when wetThis thing turns into a slip-and-slide if you drip sweat on it. Not fun when trying to downward dog.3. It tends to move around a bit during use.Not a huge issue, but it can be annoying at times.All things considered, I like this mat. It fit my budget, and it's a good size. It's my first, so i have nothing to compare it to. But it did fall short in some areas that mattered to me.

  Ok, I admit it's early in our relationship - but I like this mat. The smell is WAY overstated by some folks - I used this mat in yoga class 20 minutes after I cut it out of the plastic and it smelled a LOT better than the shared mats in my yoga class.  I later learned this mat is too thick for yoga and I need a 1/4 inch thick mat... ok, I get it but I'm over 6' 2"" and I am built more like a lineman than a tall ballerina - so this mat works fine. When I do tree pose my weight converts this mat into a sub-quarter inch thick mat and I don't have any issues with a too-soft mat.I'm sure the strap that came with it is fine  - I gave it to my wife who uses it with her 1/4 inch mat ...It seems to be a good mat even though it's disadvantaged having no high-end trademark by a famous equipment company with model spokespersons ... it's just a low price thick green Amazon mat and so far it's rocking the task -

  This mat has a chemical smell that attaches to you like in the Seinfeld episode The Smelly Car.  I have tried everything to get rid of it including ivory dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, febreze, over ten days of sun and fresh air, and eventually an industrial washing machine.  The smell has defeated all of these methods which is quite impressive.  I did use it twice, and it was nice. However, I cannot take the smell.

  Worst purchase ever. I bought this on May 1st 2018 and have had it sitting out trying to air out. Today is June 10 and it still smells like cat pee, And I don't own a cat!! The stench just permeates the room. I would be far too embarrassed to take this to a yoga class. I have sprayed it down TWICE with super grade odor neutralizer and still ZERO luck. Save your money and absolutely look for something else.  Stay with 1/2 inch though, as that's a great thickness. But don't buy here, unless you want this horrible stench to linger in your home or embarrass you in class too.

  Love this mat!  I use this at home for ""off days"" from the gym, for mat exercises and/or stretching.  It has sufficient padding to not hurt the knees or back, and to feel comfortable doing exercises.  It rolls out nicely, and didn't quickly roll back after being unrolled - like some of the other ones I've had.  It smelled a little funny (plastic-y) at first, but that went away after a day of having it out/unrolled.  The length is quite long and fits all 5'4 of me. For the price and quality, I'd surely recommend!

  I wanted to like this and I will start out with the only positive I can think about this product.  It's small and easy to hide.  Originally I was going to give this three stars but the negatives added up and then they updated the app and made things much worse.  You can view history and set alarms on both the phone app and the web interface.  However each interface has different abilities with some options on one but not the other.  The maps looked similar until the phone app updated.  The mess of lines when tracking history became even more unbearable as it lost the function of telling you the direction of travel on the phone app.  You can export a log file but it has no real support for viewing on google earth, you loose all track lines and are stuck with random dot points.  Pulling up history often limits you to pulling up a full days worth of tracking.  So it's not easy to single out a hour or two of when you knew a particular event happened or perhaps the time a particular person was driving unless you want to download the file and alter it using third party software..Battery life was bad.  If you are actually tracking a moving object it takes more power.  I did stretch it out to 2.5 days once or twice but many days I had to charge it everyday.  To overcome this I was going to hard wire it into the vehicle... until they updated the app.  Also note that being discrete in removing and installing it so often to charge the tracker is difficult to do. Also hard wiring it in defeats the purpose of having a small device.  I even tried the low power setting turning the device off for 15 minutes then on for 5 to take a reading but it did not help much.  Instructions for doing that are pretty much non existent but you can make these changes on the web interface but not the app.  The app was slightly better at giving you more options for past history as long as it was in the past 24 hours.  But no matter what way you checked history after a day went past you only could view full days at a time.  At it's best this tracker can update once a minute.  This is actually the slowest setting for other trackers, some update every 3 to 5 seconds.  What this means is that often the track will not follow roads.  I also used other trackers that easily lasted 2 full weeks vs 1 day this unit often gave me.  At one minute intervals it was possible to see many stops when other people got into the car.  But reducing the intervals in attempt to save battery life lost the ability to see people pull over to pick somebody up.  It also makes it impossible to determine what roads were actually used. It does not track data like miles driven like others do.  In terms of functionally I had better luck with free apps on an old cell phone.  Oops I dropped my phone in the car again? Silly me.  The ""magnetic mount"" is actually a magnet attached to velcro and made no sense to me.  The app lost functionality after they updated it.  It also changed to a very plain looking map by default that actually makes it difficult to figure out the location.  You can change the view to something more viewable but it always changes itself back to the default view I dislike.Update 10/17/2019As mentioned before originally I was going to give this a three star review but ended up giving it one star for all the things I already mentioned.  So how did we get to this point?  I am actually giving it five stars at this point.A representative reached out to me.  He was very professional and actually appreciated my negative input.  But more importantly I was under the impression that they strive to make the product better.  I waited to update this review though, perhaps a little too long.  I wanted to see the actions and improvements first.  But yeah, customer service and attention to detail really impressed me.So what about those improvements that I am talking about?  Both the web interface and the Android app received updates.  The battery saving function is now available on all formats and it was simplified to set up.  History can now be looked up without the cluttered mess of looking at a full day.  The map now retains your preferred method of viewing it, the arrows are back indicating direction of travel.  I added another photo so you can see for yourself the difference between the old app map and the new one that indicates direction of travel. The app is also less cluttered looking but at the same time gives you more available information.  I no longer have to switch from the app to pc to get all features as everything is more uniform.  I was told they would attempt to add even more features and I believe they will.The unit itself is currently selling below the competitors.  It accurate.  The monthly fee is also below most competitors.  Battery life is still somewhat of a disappointment to me.  But it normally falls between what they claim.  For me usually two days as this point but at times it surprises me with a third day.  I can't take a star off for this as it is in a normal variance and as advertised.  However the thing with this device is that you can choose what you want.  A small device that is very lightweight for a kid to carry in a backpack or...... Get the optional battery pack/water proof holder with magnetic mount.  The choice is up to you.  I have not used the the extended battery pack yet but it's charging now as I write this.  Although it does add size to the small tracker it does not make it any larger than the competitors in other waterproof cases.  I will perhaps update after I get familiar with how well the case/extended battery works.  For now though this company has completely turned my opinion around with great customer service.Update 12/03/2020I just cancelled my service.  I just wanted to say that this company changed so much in the time I started to use them.  I originally hated this product but it has given me piece of mind many times.  The reason I cancelled it is because my kid turned 18 and has a job now.  I no longer feel I should track his every movement as he is now an adult.With the extended battery I had no problem going weeks before it needed a recharge.  When the battery level dropped down to 10% I would get a low batt warning.  The battery would still last about 5 days after getting the first warning (with the optional pack).  The standard battery is poor though.I found the service itself to be accurate.  They added many things such as running mileage and other reports.  In some areas sometimes it gives you readings of KPH instead of MPH despite everything being set up correctly.Overall I am now a happy customer.  Customer service always responded quickly to my concerns.  Perhaps come spring time I will install this unit to track my motorcycle and get service for it turned back on but at this point it's no longer needed.

  We initially got a GPS tracking device to be able to track our special needs son in the event he would go missing.  We pin it to his pocket when he goes to school, when we are out and about on the weekends, and when we go out of town or on vacation.  Our biggest fear is that one day he will go missing and he won't be able to communicate to someone who he is, where he lives, what the home number is, etc.  With this device and the phone app, we have piece of mind that if he ever goes missing, we will be able to find where he is at.  We love the comfort of knowing where he is at that we go one for our other child who is not special needs, just in case.We used to have another GPS tracking device that we used for a number of years, but that (as many of the older GPS tracking devices do) worked on the G2 network which is slowly being phased out.  Over the last few years we've seen a lot of the functionality on that other GPS tracker go away.  The thought of not being able to track our son was heartbreaking for us and finding a replacement GPS tracker was difficult to do because they all were using the 2G network.  We finally found this Tracki device and per the specs it runs on the 3G network.  I was so excited when we found this we immediately ordered a set of them.  I will have to say I was skeptic at first because it seemed like such a new product (we ordered ours in August and all the reviews we were able to find anywhere were only from a few months ago) but we figured we had nothing to loose, if we weren't happy, we could cancel service.  I will have to say that this device and the company have far exceeded my expectations and my experience with other devices.The price of the device is extremely reasonable.  The plans are great.  Right now, since we've been trying it out we went with the month to month plan, but at some point we will switch to one of their yearly plans, which will save us money.The app is still relatively new.  It was released in March 2019 and they are at version 2.3.  I can say that it has greatly improved and they are constantly making improvements and releasing updates.  The app will get a notification for any of the triggers you setup (such as enter or leave a zone you define).  If you want other people to get notified of activities, they don't need to have the app, you can setup the app to send text messages to specific mobile numbers and you can also set it up to send e-mail to specific e-mail address.  It will show you the batter life that remains for the device, and you can set it to notify you if the device hits a percent battery life so that you know it's time to recharge the battery.  The batter life is great, we go a few days without having to charge it.  You can set it up to refresh location every 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 minutes or even 1, 2, or 4 hours.  The app will even let you ""ping"" the device so that it will beep.  We've used this option a few times when the kids didn't remember exactly where in the house they put their device.  This is a great feature!!  It will also let you see past history of the device movement, this might come in handy at some point if anyone goes missing.The device has some nice features as well.  It has a power button so you can turn the device off at night.  Other's don't have this.  We power them down when the kids come home, that saves batter life.  It has 3 buttons, one is an SOS button in case your child runs into problems, it will notify the app on the phone and let you know the SOS button was pressed.  It has 2 other buttons as well that you can use for whatever you want to be notified for.  It comes with a clip that you can put on, so a child can clip it to their pants.  It has a little ring loop that you can put a key ring on.  We put a small cable tie with a safety pin so that we could pin it to our sons pockets to make it harder to take off.You may see comments that say that the device is not accurate.  I will say, based on experience on trying several GPS tracking devices, they are all like that.  It might not update the second you look at the app, but it will update, just give it time.I've called customer support twice for help on two different items, and they were VERY accommodating and EXTREMELY helpful.  In the ""Help - Contact Support"" section of the app, it has a button to ""Call Support"", so they make it easy to get a hold of them when you need to.

  I've been involved with tracking devices since 2007. At the time they were $750. wholesale costs. The devices could only used GPS either direct or reflective mode. Anyway, these guys got it right.GPS is very sensitive. If GPS is not available due to satellite obstruction, then the unit switches to Cell Tower triangulation which is not as accurate as GPS, but still very good. Furthermore, the unit can pole the WIFI hotspots in the area to get a good location.Word is out on an update adding some additional features, once released will prove to be a valuable add-on.So, would I recommend one to any of my relatives, yes, only if I don't want them to get lost.Good product and great service.Charles

  It is a very good device and the application is superb! Customer service is the best I have ever encountered!I change my review after a call from one of the developers. I was assured that my problem of too many false alarms will be fixed in the soon to come update (an option to only send alarms based on the GPS data and not from mobile antenas)So since I saw how they really care for their customers and since this device already saved my dog once (when I saw that it's not moving so I went there and saw her being cought in a fence and couldn't find the way out). I changed my review to 5 stars.

  I was skeptical about getting the product. But I’ve been wearing it for a little over a week now and it is truly amazing! If you look at the picture you can see how I was a bit slouched in my stance and when I put the Posture Corrector on it helped straighten up my stance.When tighten the straps, it pushes my shoulders back & straightens my back up to a comfortable position. At first it was uncomfortable to wear but my body began to adjust over the next few days and the benefits of this products have been very rewarding.I am a daycare provider and I am constantly picking keeps up daily, especially when changing diapers... it’s puts a strain on my shoulders and back when lifting but since wearing this, it has helped me with my rightful lifting techniques. I wear it either over my shirt or under my shirt.I would definitely recommend!

  I bought this product for my mother because I noticed that she had been complaining about her mid-back hurting and that she kept on driving her shoulder forward from using her phone so much.  I didn't believe the ""STOP looking down at your phone so much...you're gonna get that form"".  Well, it's true. I waited about 2 weeks before giving an honest review and I am so happy that I got this for my mom.  She doesn't have pain that much anymore and it's significantly subsiding as the days progress. Before, she couldn't raise her hand above shoulder height because her back was strained from being in a hunched position all day because COVID-19 has restricted much activities. Anyway, now she's extremely happy that she uses it and is happy that she can hang her fresh laundry on the clothesline. Seeing her happy and pain-free really makes me smile during these times.  I do want to point out that she does use it for more than 15 minutes.  I think she uses it for about 1-2 hours then takes it off to stretch and then puts it on after a couple hours.

  This was exactly what I needed! I work at a desk all day, or I'm on my phone, or I'm doing my nails, or playing video games and posture has just become and after thought. I saw a doctor who suggested I see a chiropractor and get a massage and practice correct posture to get rid of my tension migraines. This has helped tremendously so much so that I remember to keep better posture even when I'm not wearing it. I love that it is adjustable so I can wear it over big fluffy sweaters or under my cardigan. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion and I am so glad I did!

  I have chronic upper back pain as a result of poor posture, that started during puberty. As a petite, big busted woman, I would often hunch over for “modesty”, to the point that I considered getting breast reduction surgery from the back pain, but couldn’t afford it. I went to chiropractors and physiotherapists, anything to alleviate my pain. An orthopedic surgeon said I started developing osteoarthritic changes in my cervical bone, despite being in my 30s! At this point, as you can imagine, I’m willing to try anything! I wear this at home in the evenings for an hour or so, and it’s making me more conscious of my posture at all times, even when I’m not wearing it. It does alleviate my upper back pain, at least temporarily. For the cost, I think that’s a win! I may need to incorporate some back exercises to correct my posture, as this alone may not cut it, but all in all, it’s definitely helped my posture to some extent. I find myself adjusted my posture at work, when I drive, when I’m at my desk, etc. thanks to this getting me in the habit.

  Didn’t know I needed this! I started working 1 year ago and started experiencing lower back pain. People always say I have good posture, so I didn’t think that was the problem. However, when I sit at my desk for a long time, I think I start to slouch. I just wear this at home when I’m watching tv or cooking, and I’ve already noticed a big difference! I think everyone’s different so you might want to play around with it and see what works for you! Here’s how it’s been working for me.TIPS:- I started out by keeping it loose so instead of strictly holding my shoulders back, it just prevented me from bringing them forward. Overtime, I made it tighter so I can be slowly adjusted to better posture rather expecting myself to snap into it right away!- I wear it over a shirt so it’s more comfortable! I noticed that some people complained it’s uncomfortable under your armpits but just wear it over something!

  I have been having some back pain for while now. This works for me. Its not to hard to put on, it even comes with instructions on how to put it on. I have bought a few in the past (different kinds) and this one seems to fit better and be a little more comfortable. You have read some reviews about how uncomfortable they are and yes they are not like sleeping on clouds. This is made for you to wear to relieve some back pain and to help your posture. There is going to some discomfort around your ""underarm"" area but for me its not to much of a bother vs the pain I have from my back by not using this. I am a 40 year old man that is 5 ft 10 in. 260 lbs. I wear this under my shirt so it would not make my dress shirts all messes up. If you do it is a good idea to work an undershirt. If you are looking for something that is going to feel like heaven than you might was well stop looking for something like this. If you are looking for something that is going to help with your posture and/or relieve some back pain you should try this. Just remember that its not going to be very comfortable but it is also not going to be something you can not stand if you put it on right.

   I’ve only had these for a week, so I feel that a longer period of ownership and use is necessary to give a more accurate review of the durability of these bands. That being said, they’ve held up great so far. They’ve been awesome to use for resistance training and especially my leg workouts, I have arthritis in both knees from my time in the Army and struggle to do heavy weights on leg day. So I opted for resistance training instead, and these have been perfect for it. I also injured my left shoulder in the military, so I’ve been using these in place of the cheap physical therapy bands I’m always issued by the VA. Excellent product so far, and with the accessories you can do a wide variety of exercises. The ankle bands are a bonus, allowing me to target leg muscles I couldn’t normally do with other resistance bands.

  There’s very little (if anything) to dislike about these resistance bands. They are adjustable and their versatility allows for them to be used to complete a large variety of exercises. Everything from curls, chest presses, toes, and even squats. The major determining factor for me was being able to adjust the weight up to 150lbs. Not only that but it comes with ankle bands and a block that allows you to attach to your doorway to get even more exercises. They even include a pouch if you want to take them with you on the go! Honestly this has been an excellent buy and I can’t recommend it enough!

  PROS1.  Very durable material.  Tolerates good stretch/tension.  2.  Portable exercise equipment.  3.  Wide variety of exercises possible - comes with suggested exercise, but you can make your own variations, too.  4.  ""Stackable"" - you can add the tension bands together for more resistance.  5.  Both color-coded and resistance level written in pounds on each band.  6.  Comfortable, sturdy grips.  7.  Quick change-out clips are excellent.  8.  Comes with ankle straps.CONS1.  I have a couple of ""competitor"" tension band products from prior purchases (SPIRIT brand) that have a bit more length and so offer a bigger range of motion for certain exercises.  I use both, but you can probably get away with one product.I like working out at home because it saves time and money.  I am in the best shape since my 30's with these and I am very soon 51.  I'm genuinely impressed that these, along with Pilates, and a doorframe pullup bar have given me a better physique than I've had in twenty years.  Less wear-and-tear on the joints, too, which is important as we age.  Give them a try!If I come up with any concerns or problems I will add that to this review.

  Like a gazillion other people I started building a home gym when COVID started. Ordered early and was lucky to get all the main pieces but I didn't order any dumbells. Once I went to add them, zero luck. I was hoping to score a set of adjustables like the Bowflex ones, but they're out of stock most anywhere unless you're willing to pay double retail via eBay.When I saw these I thought there's no way they actually work but they had a ton of positive reviews and Amazon makes returns so easy I figured why not, they'll probably suck and I'll just send them back. So I ordered last night, got them today and I'm happy to say I was totally wrong!They're not dumbbells so it's a different experience. The resistance gets harder as you go through the range of motion, versus with a dumbbell it's the full weight from the moment you pick it up. So if you're doing curls, for example, you don't start to really feel it until you're maybe 1/3 the way through the range of motion and it gets progressively harder as you get towards the top of the rep.That said, they are a pretty amazing alternative. You can do a legit workout with them and the exercises you can do are really only limited by your creativity. In the picture I posted I wrapped them around one of the stands on my power rack to do seated rows. If you want to go heavier just clip both ends to the same handle and do them one arm.I can't speak to how long they'll hold up, but I also only paid $50 so I'm not that concerned.Added bonus, my five-year-old son thinks they're totally fun. I threw the whole thing over the pull up bar on the rack and he spend an hour being a gymnast on them. They're worth the price just for that!Totally satisified and already recommended them to a couple of people.

  This product is false advertising. I have a different set of bands similar to this. I purchased this one because it advertised 50lb resistance. It doesn’t. Everything is half the weight. I thought I’d try to get more resistance for days I can’t make it to the gym. The pictures clearly show that the girth of the cable that claims 50lb resistance is the same as my other one that shows 25lb resistance. About to get my money back. Upon using, they both have the same resistance.Update: they have done right by me.

  Terrible, terrible product. I’ve now had two of these resistance band sets and the bands keep snapping (pretty much the exact opposite of what you want). They don’t provide a customer service number and claim that only Amazon can fulfill a refund or exchange, even though the materials provided in the box claim a 100% Money Back Guarantee. This is a bad, bad company, DON’T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!

  So far they are great. Really like the fact that they are stackable. My husband and I workout together so to be able to easily unclip and clip again without taking all the bands down really stood out to us. So far so good. Would purchase again and I’ve already recommended to some friends.

  I like this trunk mount, i does the job if you install it CORRECTLYPros: - It fits most sedans or hatchback cars - It holds two adult bikes no problem - Looks and feels well made - Straps are solid - Pads are good enough to keep it from scratching your trunk or glass if you have a hatchback - Installs in minutesCons: - None so farOverall i really like this trunk mount, i drove 36 miles at about 70 MPH and the unit felt solid with two adult bikes in the back.Before you head out MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL the mount correctly to avoid any accidents!!!!!What i did is I`ve added few weatherstrip seal to each hook to keep it from scratching the paint on my car, but once you apply pressure the seal comes off easily so i decided to change the location of the hooks and set it up INSIDE my trunk (Please look at the pictures to see where i install them) it works WAY BETTER and also is more secure and doesn`t scratch your trunk.I also added a bungee cord once the bikes are hold in place just in case Murphy's law :-)[...]If you have any questions you can ask me: marquino17@gmail.com

  The Allen Sport's website says this model does not fit the Corolla S because of the clearance of the rack onto the trunk over the spoiler. I decided to give it a shot anyway as the price was so cheap. Here is my finding..First, the rack has a warning about the two metal hooks you have to set into place during assembly being a pinch point. Do not ignore this. I wore a glove when setting them and had no issues but I can definitely see how someone could get hurt. Assembly was simple, basically that was the only step.Second, if you set the bottom pads of the rack against your license plate and the top on the trunk, it clears the spoiler fine. The metal hooks mentioned earlier do rest against the spoiler and can easily cause scratches. I used a piece of foam to separate and it worked out fine.Third, many reviews mention the hooks that attach to the sides of the trunk scratching the paint. I used a piece of foam with an adhesive side under each hook to keep it off the paint, no issues.Fourth, an extra bungee comes in handy to keep loose bits like the front tire from moving around too much. Get creative.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. The rack is being used for one bike but I don't think a second one would cause an issue with this set up. Again, great price to not at least give it a shot. Glad I did.

  A lot of the negative reviews on here say that their strap failed on the highway and/ or on long trips. Never trust the straps, they are only made to keep the bikes from sliding around on the rack. ALWAYS bungee your bikes to the rack AND to themselves if you have more than one. Bungee cords are cheap. Bikes are expensive. Do the math.

  While the manufacturer's web site does not mention Tesla compatibility, I decided to take a risk and bought this bike rack 102DN model.It fits Tesla Model 3 well - there are 5 clips : two on top, two on the sides and one at the bottom - each with adjustable strap. It took me about 15 min to ""assemble"" (unfold and attach two pins) and install the rack. Once you have the straps adjusted for proper length, it should take just couple minutes to get this rack installed.The rack does not prevent trunk from opening and should not hit rear window - see the photo in the review - however it is quite hard to open the trunk with the bike mounted on it :)I bought two bike rack and like the tie-downs - as these tie-downs are secured in specific positions for each bike. I would strongly suggest to get couple bungee cords - so you can secure front wheels.

  I was initially looking for a roof rack mounting system, but at $300+, I couldn't justify it just yet. Once I came across this item, I was skeptical at first, as I read mixed reviews, and then the much lower price than most other systems. Also, I'm using this on a 2007 Nissan Sentra.However, after having owed this for a couple months now, I can safely say my doubts are gone! I've used it about a dozen times for short in town trips, but the real kicker was my most recent trip home. I still had one bike at my parents’ house in SE Wisconsin that I wanted with me, near Nashville, TN. To be  honest, I had my reservations about using this over 600 miles at highway speeds. Turns out my fear was for naught! Thankfully!The directions are very clear on how to tie off the main supports as an added security measure. I also saw that another reviewer had wrapped the metal latches with electrical tape to prevent scratching. I followed suit, and so far I have none. The only thing to be careful of (and they have red warning stickers pointing this out) is when you put the silver colored wire struts in place BE CAREFUL! You can easily pinch your fingers.Again, this is a fantastic product, and great bang for your buck! I highly recommend. Also, this isn't a verified purchase because I bought it through Wally World, not Amazon.

  The first one had the ropes on backward, which is fine for your more daring baby who prefers to swing upside down. Because the child's spoilsport grandmother wouldn't go along, we returned it for a version that swings right side up. We very pleased with that admittedly somewhat more boring configuration.

  Can't find a link to contact the seller so I'm trying this.The swing is well above our heads when mounted indoors. The ropes are very short and wont work for us indoor or outdoor. We already threw out the box it came in. Can we return this with a different box?We don't know how to safely extend the rope. Is there something you'd recommend?I really think the product description should say that this swing is designed for a swing-set. Someone looking to connect to ceiling or tree would be better off buying something else. It's really a bummer that we are going to have to buy rope or chain and rig something up to make this work for us. I don't want to take the swing apart and replace the ropes because that doesn't seem safe.

  be careful how you hang this thing because if you hang it the way you're told to by the directions, the rope could come out of the bracket and leave your small baby dangling sideways and terrified like it did mine. Hang it by the carabiners only.

  It's been up for almost two years and I am very pleased.I purchased separate smooth swinging eye swivels to hook them to. I bought two of these and my grandchildren love them.Easy adjustment, easy in and out with straightforward adjustments once my grandkids are in them.Even though they are not intended for older kids, I have a niece who is in 3rd grade and she sat in them and swung without breaking. Very comfortable and no pinch-points so far.You can control the tilt of the swing easily to accommodate little ones that don't have a lot of neck strength yet.Lots of fun, easy to hang and I highly recommend these toddler swings that will see many years of use!

  Okay, so we're not using this with a swing set, we're using it with a 90 foot zip line in the back yard. We put our one year old grand daughter on the zip line seat, and held her in place for a couple rides. When it was time to get off, the world exploded! Major tantrum! So, I ordered this so we wouldn't have to hold her in place and BINGO!! Works great and she LOVES IT!! My back loves it too! I'm sure it would work every bit as well with a swing set. No issues or concerns with safety using this swing seat, though we make all the kids (ages 1,4,5 and6) wear helmets when riding.

  Very sturdy and well built swing. It holds my squirmy 1.5 year old very securely, and the safety clasps are out of reach for him to manipulate. Every time we play outside he will ask to go in his swing. It seems very comfortable for him because he falls asleep in it and he never complains while in it like he does when he's in one of those thick rubber bucket seats you find at public parks. I was so pleased with the swing, I purchased a second one for our property. Very easy to get him in and out. When hanging the seat from a tree branch, I'd recommend pairing with a canvas/nylon swing strap and not to use a chain directly around the branch. At first I used a chain from Lowe's to wrap around a 6 inch thick branch, and about a month and a halfs worth of repetitive use caused the chain to saw about 1/3rd through the branch. Excellent product and very highly recommended over the other products on the market

   Was in the market for convenient  ball pump since we seem to collect countless deflated balls in my home 😁 Pump was packaged nicely and a little smaller than expected. Packaged with 4-5 additional ball needles.  I actually put extra needles in a baggie & taped to the pump so everything is kept together. Pump was really easy to use, did not take my entire upper body (like old school pumps) to actually pump the ball and able to hold the pump & ball at the same time. I’m so used to old bicycle pumps that I must be easily impressed with this compact one. Sold at a great price, quality plastic & doesn’t look like it’s going to break with frequent use.**If you found this review helpful, please take a moment and hit the button below and let Amazon know!

  I'm a club volleyball coach and we often have to bring our own bag of balls to tournaments, even the ones where we have to fly there.I bought this a while ago to keep in my coaching backpack (which is filled to the brim with things, like a first aid kit, a few clipboards, notebooks, coaching tools, etc.) and both the pump and the needle have not broken at all. I was worried about having the needle in the ball pump and putting it in my backpack, but after months of throwing that backpack around and lugging it all over the country, it hasn't bent, snapped, etc. at all.On top of that, it's pretty ergonomic and so it's pretty easy to use. I had to use it once in a quick situation during warmups and I was able to re-inflate a ball while also talking to the players about strategies for the game that was about to start.Highly recommend!!

  This was more amazing than I expected. With so many disappointments, I was ready for another one, but with the high reviews, I took a chance. AND, wow! It worked so well.

  I have a 4 year old child that has quite the collection of balls so having an air pump is not a luxury, but a necessity in our house.  Before ordering the Sportbit I had previously only ever used the standard model ball pump.  I like the compact size of the Sportbit pump and it’s definitely an all around improvement from the ball pumps I’ve been using.  It’s priced fairly and come with 5 needles.  One thing I’m not yet able to speak for is the longevity and durability of this pump.  I’ve had it for just 2 days at the time of writing this review.  With that said I like the Sportbit’s size and effectiveness.  If it’s hold up to periodic use for a long time, and I have no reason to believe it won’t, then it will have more than payed for itself.  I would recommend purchasing this pump.

  The ball pump arrived with five needles, as stated and there's a free ebook(have to check that out still) just as advertised. The pump and needles appear well made and durable. It's compact whick seems nice for toting to the park but I had some concern when ordering about whether it would be strong enough. We used it right away to pump up a mushy basketball. The handle has a comfortable ergonomic grip at the ball side that is a bit easier to hold while pumping than my previous completely straight pump. I like the soft grip material on the pump side also. It maintains good pressure and only took a few pumps to fill the ball, no leaking while filling. The soft needle plug is a nice feature. The needle was easy to install and I can see how it will help prevent bent needles. All in all, I'm happy with this pump and can definitely recommend it.

  When I was a kid, we used bicycle pumps to put air in our basketballs and footballs. I gave this to my 8'yr old granddaughter who loves to play basket ball and she was very frustrated with it. You have to pump it a million times to get any air to move, and in frustration she passed it off to me. I found that as the ball got to it's finished pressure, that I had to pump faster and faster to get it to fill. In other words, it would have been impossible for a kid, and frustrating for me. I wished I had my old bike pump from my kid days again. The other challenge (of course) is that there is no air pressure gauge on it... but it's pretty clear to me that there's no way you could OVER inflate a ball with this pump.

  So far so good. My daughter plays every sport under the sun so a pump like this is essential. She finally got that basketball aired up after months of it just sitting and collecting dust.The best part of this product is the customer service experience. I received both a shipping notification email and a confirmation of product receipt email from the company. You just don’t see that personal touch very often these days, so I’m always incredibly impressed when I find a vendor/company who also recognizes that customer satisfaction should always be the ultimate goal.

  So the moveable tip worried and threw me off the first couple times of using it, but now that we are used to it, it is great.  Even when we were not used to it, it was great.  Works as advertised, comes with more than enough additional needles.  My only knock would be that all those needles have no place to go once you have opened the packaging.  We put them in a ziplock, but it would be nice to have something to hold them together.The pump itself works well, no issues after using it for over a month, including my 6yr old son who always wants to pump up his soccer or basketball and is not as gentle as myself.

  “Rawlings Official League” baseballs. Sounds good doesn’t it? Well maybe not so much. When they arrived I pulled one out and grandson and I started throwing it back and forth. Not hard just a little tossing 25-30 feet apart. I noticed the stitches were rough and uneven. I am not a baseball guy, but I play for grandson. If I notice imperfections I’m sure a real player would even more so. Looked close and lo-and- behold “China” in small print on ball. Need I say more? Cheap stuff, shame on Rawlings.

  Absolutely TERRIBLE quality. The balls actually start falling apart. The balls are not leather: the cover is a synthetic material that actual starts peeling off like paint.

  If you're coaching a little league team and need a lot of practice balls, you cant go wrong with these.  I coach a 6-8yr old ""coach pitch"" team.  These are a great bang for your buck for practice balls.  In my opinion better than Rawlings' R100-UPY practice balls.  If you do the math, each ball is < $2.00 ea.; compare that to other baseballs unit costs.  We've lost a few balls, on average 6-10 balls per season.  Either from practice or a kid takes one home.  Replacing lost practice balls wont cost me $50 and up.  However I do use Rawlings RLLB balls for games.The feel is what you would expect out of a cheap ball - cheap.  Regardless, these are only meant for practices.  These balls are great during wet weather practices because they are resistant to excessive water log compared to any yarn wound baseball.  You don't get the pinging from bats with these, it's more of a ""POCK"" sound, and it doesn't leave the bat in a hurry like the RLLB balls.  Overall, the OLB3 balls perform well.

  These are batting practice baseballs.  They are perfect for that purpose.These are not intended for serious play.  The seams are flat and the cover is substandard.  But it's 12 balls for $20 so you can lose them or abuse them in batting practice without breaking the bank.UPDATE:  The price has gone up from $19.99 to $32 - the value definitely takes a hit at the higher price point.

  Just OK, but the price is low and may work for you if your goal is to to add practice balls without spending much $. However, my boy doesn't like hitting these because they come off the bat with a duller ""thud"" than most other balls and tend not to fly as far. That's OK, maybe it will make him swing harder, but I wouldn't buy them again. I'll stick to leather or other brands of balls with synthetic covers. I purchased these on Amazon and think work a little bit better (although leather is still better): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CIX9WA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

  Terrible balls. Yeah they're ""value"" but you're not saving enough to justify how bad they are. They came impressioned and misshapen just from shipping. Slippery, plastic feel with bad, flat stitching. Too plastic-y to toss with. Too poor of quality to hit with.Immediate return and deceptively labeled. ""Official league"" - no league I've ever heard of would use these balls. Just because they're stamped ""Rawlings"" doesn't mean they're the ball you're used to.

  I have been using these tees for a few years - I love these tees. I use the top of the blue field for my drive height, that provides me with a consistent height that I don't have to eyeball guess. I tee them down to just below the cup for irons if I can't find a short broken tee on the ground.. They are wooden and aren't indestructible but they seem to last longer than any other tee I've used. The price on Amazon is usually less than I can find them at the various golf stores in town. The free shipping makes buying them a no brainer. I try to keep one open bag of tees in my golf bag and one unopened in the trunk for reserve. I don't like the sound or feel of the click from plastic tees, so it's wooden for me all the way!

  It is really good for adjusting levels for draw and fade.but its durability is not so good. if i hit for ~260~ 270yard, well its find but when I aim it for over 300 yards, It gets easily broke its neck especially at the range (swing harder and faster)except that durability it is awesome Tee but the price is should be lower. I wish I could give it 3.5 star but I had to choose whether 3 or 4 so I gave it 4. not 3 star definitely..

  I've tried many different types of tees over the years, but I've never personally seen any huge boost in performance over standard wooden tees. But one thing I always struggled with was tee height. These tees cleared that right up. They also claim to have a lower profile which increases ball speed off the tee, but as I've not put that to the test in a simulator with numerical data to back it up I won't speak to that. Overall a good, sturdy tee, and decent bang for your buck for quality tees.

  Bought these for my friends birthday along with a new golf bag.  I tried one tee myself and it seemed as good as anything I had.  It's size worked for the driver (tee it higher)  on down - one size fits all.  I think one could use the stripe on the tee to adjust tee heights to what works best for the individual.  My tees are all solid colors so my next buy could be tees with stripes on them now that I think about it.

  Where do i start.  These are golf tees and their main purpose to be able to penetrate the tee box soil, and simultaneously hold a golf ball in place so you can swing and hit the ball.  I'm very pleased to report that these tees do both of those things, and DO IT WELL.  Will they work everytime?  I don't know.  I literally don't know anything about where you live, or the golf course that you play on.  Is your soil made of sand?  Limestone?  Granite?  Maybe it won't work.  Do you have tons of WIND?  That could affect it too.  But I would be willing to guess these tee's would work for 99.9 percent of golfers and I'd put them up against almost any other tee's that are made the exact same way.  I think they're wood by the way.  But painted.

  Pride Professional Tee System, 3-1/4 inch ProLength Plus Tee are well worth considering. They are White with Blue bands that can guide your ball height ion the tee. All you have to do is determine the right height for you and for the different clubs you hit off the tee and remember which band works for your game. Then all you have to do is walk up and set your tee and place your ball to be hit. Excellent buy.

  I ordered these from another company and they never arrive. Amazon refunded me and I ordered again because they got such good reviews. They fit really well. I have a 3 and 6 year old and they work well for both of them. They occasionally get water in the lenses but it's usually after they cannonball!They are very easy to adjust and the double strap keeps them from sliding down. My kids also love the colors.

  I purchased these for our 3 and 6 year olds.The 6 year old has been attempting to get a lot of use out of them. However, the very first time I put them on her they almost immediately started fogging up. Annoying, but it didn't surprise me. The worst part is she is getting out of the pool about every 20 minutes and saying her goggles aren't sticking to her face anymore. So I'm constantly tightening them. I'm not sure why they're not staying tight. After awhile I see that the strap has slipped down the back of her head and are now folding her ears over and not long after that she's saying they're not sticking to her face.The 3 year old tried them on a few times, but doesn't have much interest in wearing them. They seem to fit him though, at least for the very short period of time he's wearing them. I'm sure he'll have the same problem she's having.I guess I'll just wait for these to break so I can try a different brand.

  These stay on my 2 yr old better than her FINIS, but the eyes are set just a bit wider. They work but I have to pay attn to how they sit to make a seal. That said, it's well worth it to then NOT have to ADJUST the straps (and pull her hair) multiple times as the straps slip around. And once she's a tad bigger I won't even have to think about it. Great value. Will buy again.

  So they look like they're 2 different products, the blue one has the Omeril logo and it's not the best but does the job. However, the purple/pink has no logo on it and appears to be of a lower quality, the straps on it are very flimsy. It keeps falling off when my daughter is swimming constantly needing readjustment.They both do fog up alot.

  I bought the GoSports Indoor / Outdoor Ladder Toss Game Set because my family was complaining we did not have enough outdoor games for our 4th of July get-together.  Ladder Toss has long been one of my kids' favorite games so I decided to order this item from Amazon.  I have been very pleased with this purchase.The set is easy to assemble and durable.  These are a must for outdoor games.  If one tube breaks of a connector comes loose the entire game is worthless.  This set is solid.  We have used it all summer long.  It provides my adult kids and their friends with seemingly endless hours of entertainment.Set up is quick and easy ... takes less than two minutes to assemble.  The rubber bolos are attached to a sturdy nylon rope that shows no signs of fray or fatigue.  Throw the rubber bolos at the three tiered ladder and hope the rope catches so that the rubber balls become entwined on a rung of the ladder.  That's how you score points.  Sounds easy ... takes some skill ... always a fun game that EVERYONE can play.  Also, makes for a great drinking game ... but is definitely fun for the whole family whether drinking alcohol, water or juice.We have owned a few ladder toss sets over the years.  The others ultimately succumbed to use and abuse.  This set feels much more substantial than any set we have previously owned.  We have gotten an entire summer's worth of fun out of it and I have high hopes that it will last for several seasons more.I am very pleased with my purchase of the GoSports Indoor / Outdoor Ladder Toss Game Set.  Five stars.  If you find this review helpful please click the ""Helpful"" button below.

  I purchased this product to use at our wedding reception as we were having a few yard games. Everyone loved it! Recently when we were using the game, a player had lost their balance and stepped on one of the games, breaking a few pieces. I contacted GoSports to see if I could get replacement parts. Their customer service is amazing! They responded to each email in a very timely manner, and sent replacement parts out in no time, coming in the very next day of being shipped. After receiving the replacement parts, one of the bars did not fit properly with some of the original parts. Not looking for anything more, I contacted GoSports to see if they had any suggestions on how to make the pieces fit. Instead of sending out a new part again, GoSports actually replaced the entire set!! And again, was delivered the very next day! I cannot thank GoSports enough for their amazing customer service and for standing by their product. Thank you!

  Great quality and very durable cloth tape. Hard to find a tape that’ll actually keep bandages and rolled gauze in place sometimes. This tape & adhesive is the best I’ve used, no more wasting money trying other brands and styles . Width of tape, and ability to tear without scissors are a huge plus.  Very happy, have ordered many times and will order again.

  This is 3M's most adhesive tape, and although it performs pretty well in the dry, it does not perform well enough when damp such as from sweating.  However it is stickier than McKesson surgical silk cloth tape and MUCH stickier than the Band Aid and Rite Aid cloth tapes that you get from the Pharmacy (yes, we have tried a few!).  For blister prevention, Leukotape is still the best - not only is it sticky, it keeps sticking when wet, and the fabric weave is much tighter and thicker providing better protection.

  First this tape is excellent, have no problem with its performance but to answer one question it doesn’t stretch. Tough fabric type tape. Problem is you won’t get the 24 2” rolls as advertised. Ordered 3 times from 2 different sellers, this one two times. All three times came in as one single roll. (Although paperwork clearly stating I was receiving 24 rolls) Dealt with customer service each time (ask for supervisor to not waste extra time because others can’t comprehend issue). Supervisor Jeff nice, tried to fix issue, even gave $5 credit for my trouble. Said it was a stocking problem after second time and told to buy from another listed seller. It came in as a single roll again instead of 24. Didn’t bother wasting another hour calling a fourth time because they have a bigger problem than they realize no Would be an excellent deal if you received actual 24 rolls but not for just 1 roll. Also, this isn’t only item I’ve had this exact same problem. Used to love Amazon, still order a lot ,but don’t depend on receiving what I order any more. (When tape came in wrong third time my husband wasn’t going to show me package to save me from aggravation; it was obvious each time that 24 rolls couldn’t be in such a small package)

  Many bandage adhesives cause my skin to break out in a rash.  I am not allergic to latex, it is the adhesive.  This stuff works fine for me.  It adheres well; in fact, still adheres well when you want to remove it.  Can live with that.On the inside of the spool, it says 3M Durapore, which is the commercial customer name of the product.  Nexcare is the retail customer product line from 3M.

  This is a much appreciated item when you have a daily need to change wound dressings and the whole area is swollen and tender to the touch.  It will wrap around gauze, pads, but the adhesive is not very tacky, so it needs more tape than I would prefer.  It also doesn't tear easily, so I must use scissors to cut the strips as the end of anything you try to tear off will be frayed and not stick to anything else.  I knocked off a star for those two points, but it is worth the money to not cause further damage to my healing ankle wound.  Best of all, it never hurts when I have to change the dressing again each day.  Used this for a week, and now it's almost healed and no longer painful to the touch.  I'd buy it again and will keep this in my emergency medical bag for the next time.If my review was helpful to you, please let me know by checking the box below.  Thanks!

  I plan to add a about a foot of this tape to a first aid kit for homeless people along with a few other items, like triple Antibiotic ointment, a few small gauze pads and band aids. This is the same tape hospitals use. There is a plastic tape which is okay but I found this can hold up for two days but on a fresh cut or fresh wound you need to LOOK at it after one day if not sooner. Gets dirty quickly but if you care for a cut properly, it will be on the mend quickly. This tape plus a small gauze pad and some triple antibiotic ointment should do all the work for you. Toes and feet need attention daily to prevent gangrene (AHH amputation). I should know , I almost lost a toe due to infection. The podiatrist said it smelled like a deer dead for three days, but he saved it. There is paper tape but that's only for a phlebotomist who draws your blood and puts a gauze pad on with paper tape. Buy this tape as it belongs in every home first aid kit.

  Value - yes, good value.Performance - Currently, I'm a bit disappointed in this product as I'm dealing with torn skin as a result of using this product.  Is it adhesive, yes, very... maybe too strong for sensitive areas.  Also, not very tearable - transpore tape is tearable, this cloth first aid tape is not.Think it's fine to use on thicker skinned areas, but again, I'm writing this while dealing with sore, exposed skin area from tape removal (and yes, I was very slow in the removal process which was probably even more painful!)  Thank goodness it was only one strip and not all 4 strips that tore skin off :(

   Okay, so I'm not in as good of shape as I used to be. I used to work out regularly and I was pretty fit. Additionally, I have noticed my coordination and balance slowly degrade as I get older. I think jumping rope will help with all of the above.I used to work out with a speed rope many years ago so I decided to get one again. This one looked decent and was cheap, but not too cheap. I really liked that is has ball bearings to keep it from getting twisted. That used to get very annoying during long sprints.The handles are plastic and foam which is not really a bad thing. It keeps the handles extremely light while also feeling pretty solid. At times, I almost forget I have anything in my hands at all. The length of the rope is just right for me. I am just a hair under six feet tall. I was able to immediately get a good rhythm going without having to stoop over to get the rope under me. I was doing double unders within the first couple of minutes. The ball bearings work very well.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would buy again.

  I am considerably older than the last time I jumped rope.  I'm in a warmer climate and and take my exercise outside now.  The grips are easy to hold even with my arthritis.  The rope is plastic so there is no problem to skip rope in the rain.  The rope is thinner than the old fashion cloth clothesline type which means I don't have to get my big behind higher up in the air.  I know the difference is minuscule but when you are jumping up and down and are obese, every fraction of an inch is important.  My only complaint is that the rope is very long and it drags longer on the floor.  I wish they came in sizes.  I suppose it might be better to drag 12"" of rope on the floor instead of 2""; that would be less higher I have to jump.  In any case, I am keeping this rope and expect to lose a lot of calories using it in my back yard.

  Full disclosure - I got this for free to do a review.  I said I would be honest - if it was bad, I would let them know first and then print the review.I already had a ""speed rope"", which I bought for a bit more than this.  That one was cheaply made - basically a thin plastic tube that was VERY lightweight and not much use.  This, however, is surprisingly heavy duty.  It's a snap to adjust the length (unscrew the top of the handle and there's a pushdown adjuster).  I routinely used jumpropes at my dojo, and this compares favorably to those - at less than half the price.Highly recommended, and THIS is the rope I will throw in my suitcase when I travel.

  I bought these to add a little variety(jump roping) to my fitness routine.  I couldve just used good ole rope but thought Id see if a ""real"" jump rope would be better.  It is.  These arent really all that fancy but Im not sure you can make a fancy jump rope.  On the other hand, the hand grips are hollow which allowed me to fill mine with sand to make them heavier and add a little resistance to my work out.  So far these seem pretty durable as well.  I cant really use mine in my apartment because Ill disturb the people living downstairs so I take them outside on a dirt drive.  Using them on the dirt drive hasnt seemed to hurt them at all.  So for my needs, this jump rope is working out well.

  The reviews for this deck have been going on for a while. Reading through some of them before and after buying this product I found many of them to be untrue.The cards I received do not have paint that ""bubbles"" or scratches off; no negative marks there.The look of the cards is pretty cool. Each individual card is a little bit 'glossy', not fully transparent. If you fan the deck in a smooth way you see a cool 'infinity-mirror' affect. The box reminds me a little bit too much of 90s pencil holders.I do agree with a review I read that it would be nice if these cards had the tiniest bit of noticable texture, especially when wet.The worst thing in my experience: card flicking. I have a friend who can stick traditional cards into some suprising surfaces with just a flick of a wrist. I have always been jealous of his skills. Upon receiving these cards, I start to flick them at the wall. One of them shatters. :(Not the intended use of a card... so you have trade offs. Regular cards can be ruined by improper use just as easy as these cards can (as of this review).Final review: cool product, material is no worse than standard cards but has potential.

  These cards are already the hit of the summer!  For $6, we have had so much fun, the kids are rocking their math and are getting a boatload of exercise.Here are the two main ways we use them:1️⃣ Throw some in the pool (they will sink unless sitting perfectly on top of the water) and have a race to get 10 hearts, all even numbers, numbers divisible by 3, etc.2️⃣Throw only the numbered cards (2-10) into the pool (you can do all numbered or only red or black, for example) and then have the kids race to bring back cards which make an equation to make a certain number.  The kids absolutely love this!!!  We also make rules like: - your equation must be at least 3, 4 or 5 cards - we exclude the 10s - we exclude ""double digits""...  meaning you can only get one of each number.  No 2x2, for example - If I'm feeling like a softie, we'll even include the Aces to use as ones. But that makes it soooo much easier so beware! - We throw in more or less cards.  We tend to do one suit per person playing but including more would make it easier to find that one card you are looking forI love how you can tailor this to your child's level.  It has been so fun to see the equations they come back with.  They literally beg for us to do this and I love how they are working on quick math recall....  and simple equations!The ink on the cards is starting to wear off in some places  but we've already used them so much we don't even care.  They have been well worth the price for what we've used them for.  Cheaper than a math workbook and much more fun!As other reviewers have already stated, they are stiff when right out of the package but they do loosen up and become easier to play with outside of the water.  Just realize these are more plastic than paper so will feel different than traditional playing cards.

  Hoyle, if you're reading this--do two things: add a texture to the cards so they're not so slippery, and make the case slightly taller so the whole deck can sit in the ""well"" while playing or taking a break. These cards look good (but not great, a little cheap looking) but I've gotten similar or better cards for less $. Was hoping the brand-name would bring higher quality.

  I do not recommend - the print on the cards scratch off within the first use. The cards would be perfect if the print was laminated to eliminate scratching.  The cards also stick together once wet which makes shuffling a hard task but that's a fair sacrifice for being able to play card games in the pool.  The case is not perforated so the cards need to dry before you put them away.

  We like these cards, they are able to be used outdoors, in the pool, or inside.  They wash up well, and aren't ruined if you get greasy fingerprints on them during a picnic or while eating.  They are very reasonably priced, however, it takes some getting used to shuffling without spraying cards all over the table (it is good for a few laughs though)!  They are somewhat slippery holding them, especially if you have a lot (10+) in your hand and they slide around in the card holders we have.  Not sure if that is the cards' fault or the holder design.Overall, for the price they are not a bad purchase.  To be honest, we have others, somewhat textured, that we like better.But the design is very fun, and different.

  I got these for some messy/water games we were playing. They worked well. Some of the images have developped “scratches,” but they are still usable and would be unlikely to receive such rough treatment in a regular game of cards. Extensive play may not be a good fit for this deck, but I would expect that intermittent play should be fine: with no worries about  moisture or spills!They are a bit trickier to shuffle, but nothing you can’t handle.

  My husband and I play cards together often and these are the best cards I've ever owned.  They are waterproof so even if we spill something they can just be washed off.  The are pretty indestructible and will always stay crisp and not have bended corners like other cards that have been used a lot.  They are plyable enough to make it easy for my klutzy husband to shuffle.  And for me that is the best part.  Even after bending sharply to shuffle the cards evenly  and easily they go right back to their shape.  They can be a bit slippery but that is not a deal breaker.  The numbers are a good size to see clearly.  I have two decks of these cards and I do wish they came in two different colors to make separating them easier.  These really are the best cards I've ever used and the only ones I'll buy again.

  I wear a 13 wide shoe, and normally have to buy the longer version of socks or else they are too short and tight.  It's been tough to find quality athletic or heavy duty socks in long length.  I had been happy with gold toe white socks, and a few months ago I purchased black gold too in extended length. Gold Toe Men's Cotton Crew 656s - but they wore out, and got holes in the heel area after just a few months of use.  So, I though I would order these Adidas as they come in extended length and had good reviews.  I have only worn them for a few weeks, but they are not very ""athletic"" and they are not very ""cushioned"".  They are more like a normal ""dress socks"" - I can see my skin showing thru them, and they don't have any additional cushioning in heel or toe.  I purchased extended size and the length is good, but they are very tight... I have to do a little work to get them to pull up over toes, and they feel tight around my ankles and lower calves.  Also, the small plastic tabs that hold the pairs together are a pain to cut without nicking the cloth material.  I am still looking for good heavy duty cushioned socks in extended length size that fit well too and last for more than a few months.

  The socks are comfortable enough.  But they are very poor quality. When I took them off after wearing them for 1 day, I was shocked to see that they had already pilled on the bottom and threads were coming loose. I was just walking around the mall in my running shoes -- nothing very demanding.  I also found that that fit quite large.  It is too bad that I did not try them out before the Amazon return deadline. I assumed they were up to Adidas quality standards and did not open the package. I don't know if these are fakes or if Adidas quality has slipped that much. I have other socks I have worn for years.

  These socks looked good in the photo but they are pure trash.  The foot section is way too long and the leg portion is way too tight.  The material is super thin as well.  Perhaps, if you have a very long foot, (size 12 maybe), and a very skinny calf, plus you like an extremely thin fabricl, these socks would be perfect for you!  I've had Adidas socks before and never had a problem.  How they came up with such a long foot section and such a skinny leg section is beyond me.  Do yourself a favor and avoid these socks at all costs.  Good luck!

  I bought these socks, because the description was identical, as was the material composition, to Adidas socks bought in a local sporting goods store.  These socks are significantly thinner.  Next time, I will purchase at a local store to make sure the material is the same comfortable thickness as my original package.

  Update:After wearing them for awhile I noticed that they're all slightly different in length. It's weird. No sock matches another in length....it's annoying some are shorter some are longer. They were all supposed to be one length....Original review :These socks are great, I would like them to be a little tighter on the calf, as they tend to slid down throughout the day.  I recommend these socks!

  I wish manufacturers wouldn’t get consumers hooked on their products and then quietly and surreptitiously change the quality, but that is what happened here.  These socks are not the same quality they used to be.  I still have the older version and it is clear when looking at each side by side that Adidas is trying to save some money on material.  This new version is practically shear on the top.  I can see my feet through the sock!  Will not buy again.

  Shipping - arrived as promised in appropriate packagingProduct itself - purchased black socks in men’s size my son wears.  They fit as expected.Quality is the reason for a low score.  My son and I both put on a new pair, each of us had one of the socks rip.  These socks had not been worn and clearly should not have ripped upon simply putting it on.  We’ve work Adidas brand many times and have never seen such cheap quality.  I suspect these are not true adidas socks.

  This tape, I don't even know where to begin!  My seamstress Diane introduced me to this tape to help eliminate back fat from my strapless dress along with that annoying bunch at the underarms.  It works and its amazing!!!  Every bride needs to know this trick.  You take the tape and, making sure that the first end doesn't extend above your dress line, you attach it to your problem area.  Then pull the tape downwards and/or out, depending on how you want the skin to smooth.  As you pull, press the tape onto your skin and smooth it down.  Like a charm!  I loved this dress but I was dismayed to see my rear reflection when I first tried it on.  Because of that I almost didn't choose it.  I read that the proper seamstress can cut the dress in a way to reduce the appearance of back fat, but this tape did that and allowed the dress to be nice and snug, without any weird alterations.  I had the tape on for several hours after each fitting and all day/night for my wedding.  I never felt it and it didn't rip out my hair when I went to take it off.  They should honestly market this tape specifically to the wedding industry and offer it in a variety of skin tones.  A large part of me feeling stunning in my dress and totally self confident was because of the way that this tape worked.  Thank you seems insufficient.

  We usually purchase rock tape directly from our chiropractor however when we ran out I figured I would just have some shipped to me so I ordered off amazon. I purchased the beige skin color tape and it’s much thinner and not as durable as what we usually use. It’s strange. It’s as if I bought a knockoff even though it’s says “Rock Tape” inbthe packagr and roll! It does not perform the same either. It felt more like KT tape. I definitely will not buy again.

Shoulder popped out and was hanging behind my head.The same shoulder was dislocated when my UPS shirt, hooked onto door handle and I hung outside the truck until I took my ink pen to tear the shirt.Shoulder weak now at 60.  My chiropractor recommended Rock Tape.  He put it on me at his office.  Three days later, I love this tape.My shoulder is weak. I can dislocate it in my sleep.  The tape holds my shoulder up.

  This tape seems to be quality made, stretchy and supportive. HOWEVER this is for people out there who are super sensitive to EVERYTHING like me. I know it says hypoallergenic and blahblahblah but this made my skin break out in a rash and ended up with blood blisters within hours that ended up scarring:/ No i did not wear it for more than a few hours and yes I was stupid enough to try it twice and it happened TWICE! But it’s just bc I have super sensitive skin and have an allergy to latex, adhesives, food allergies, environmental allergies, etc. I get rashes when I wear ANY kind of bandaids so I shouldn’t have been surprised.

  I’ve been PT for about 3 weeks. My trap muscle and neck are extremely inflamed and tense. I work in the healthcare field and this injury has been very painful.At every session they use Rock tape & rock sauce to alleviate some of the pain and it has been fantastic! I am extremely sensitive to medication so I’ve had to deal with the pain in more natural ways.  The tape helps correct my posture as well. I decided to purchase some for home since I only see the PTA two times a week.My skin is also very sensitive but this has not caused any rash or irritation for me. It does hold up well in the shower but mine tends to become stretched out after sleeping. I toss and turn so  I’m sure the tape rubbing on the sheets causes this.Honestly this has brought me the most relief out of all of my treatments and I highly recommend it!

  I absolutely cannot believe how amazing this has worked on my aching joints & neck/back pain that I get due to an old injury. This stuff is for real! I'm nearly 53 years old and have put my body through a lot lately with remodeling & my knees were hurting so much as well as my back and neck. I'm in pretty good shape and work out, but I guess I pushed my body to the limit so when my physical therapist put this on a recent injury site (because of muscle spasms), it worked so well on alleviating those daily muscle spasms, so I bought more to try on other aches and pains. I was shocked it actually helped and I was able to reduce my pain medicine. 🙌 I love the chart that is included on how to apply in different areas, too. I can't believey doctor never recommended this years ago for my neck/back injury. Glad my physical therapist introduced me to this tape.

  I've been dealing with unbearable pain on my left foot due to plantar fasciitis and Morton's neuroma for months. I was constantly stressed and anxious; I couldn't wear shoes other than sneakers, envied people around me who could wear their seasonal booties, and became afraid to do any outdoor activities that I normally love doing. Nothing seemed to work... I tried compression socks, massagers, custom orthotics, sturdy shoes, religiously stretching morning and night... still the pain was there.It wasn't until I started taping my foot daily that I felt any improvement and relief. A couple weeks of taping later- now my left foot has never felt better. It's incredible. I had my doubts, but this experience had converted me into a true believer.My only wish is that the tape was more water resistant than advertised. Unfortunately, the tape comes off every time I shower so I go through the roll pretty quickly. Still, it's brought me utter relief and I couldn't be more thankful.

   Best sticking, stretching, supporting KT tape I’ve tried yet. It’s worth every penny. Better than the national athlete sponsored stuff. Better than the “original” KT Tape BY FAR! Water resistant & grays a lot less than others. It’s not as hard on my sensitive skin as others, but I still use a barrier cream because I’m super-sensitive to adhesives.

  I was so excited to order this game for my kids after searching for fun outdoor activities. What a disappointment for all of us. The assembly is easy but getting the net tight is almost impossible. It has to be tight to bounce well but stretching the net into the loops is hard and it often breaks the string. When we finally got it set up we all went out to play and it terrible. Too difficult for the kids and not even fun for adults. Maybe you need lots of practice but we were just wanting a simple fun game. Once you slam the ball on the net it barely bounces off and is about impossible to return. We love outdoor sports but this was a let down. Also the frame is not stable and too get the net tight it bends the plastic.

  My husband and I LOVE this game. SO.MUCH.FUN!!! We played all week at a family reunion on one that was an off brand and the bounce was definitely not as good. So it does change the game a bit if you don't have a good quality one. If you are going to be too serious about this game or play it much at all, it's not worth getting a knock off version! This is definitely better.

  My son had purchased this and because our family loves it so much I purchased a second set.  We even brought both sets to a family reunion in California this week.  They will both fit into a roller carry on bag.  We have family members age 5 up to 59 playing this game.  It's easily portable and sets up quickly.  Only suggestion is to have a pump for the balls when they get soft.  You want to keep them firm for best performance. Airplane ride will cause them to lose a little pressure.It's not only fun and easy to play but you do get your heart pumping.

  The net is probably the worst thing about spike ball. It’s a cheap net, mine even had a couple spots where it was literally hanging by a thread right out of the box. It’s also weirdly uneven so that even as I followed the video for setup, which said to make sure tension was the same on all corners, I couldn’t get it to be even without hooking on the inner part of the net in some parts. The video specifically said to only hook the outer part of the net but the net itself isn’t a circle. Setting it up so the ball actually bounces off the net takes some trial and error rather than being a simple hook and go. Once you’ve gotten the net set up how you like it, you’re better off leaving it there even though it’s supposed to be something you can pack up and put away or bring with you. Even if you leave the net attached, I doubt it will be long before one of those threads come undone just as mine were in the process of doing before I even could attach the net the first time. Perhaps if I get the pro version the net will be better, I’ll look into that more.

  Nice simple package.  A bit cumbersome to setup correctly.  It takes some practice to get the net stretched for the right bounce.  A lot of fun for the whole family once it's put together.  It's also pricey!  $30.00 would be a fair price for this.

  I do not typically write reviews for products. However, this product exceeded my expectations for the price I paid, less than 20 bucks! I will share what I liked about the product. Moreover, also how I think it could be better.So I bought this ab roller to work on my core while at home and workplace. The product arrived as accurately described with the extra knee pad and the two free ebooks (they emailed me the e-books). I have been using it for a few days, and it is destroying my core lol. Anyway, the below are the pros and cons about this ab rollerPROS- Very sturdy and high-quality ab roller. You can tell that it is made from very high-quality material.- the grips were very thick (see pictures) compared to the rod inside the roller, and I did not feel any pain in my hands after using it for 20+ reps- Love the fact that it came with the free knee pad! I have hard flooring at home, so the knee pad is a life saver for my knees! Also, the back of the knee pad has a sort of textured patterns to help with the grip- The two bonus ebooks are a very nice touch. One is on what to eat to get abs and the other on other workouts for abs. They are pretty long so I will need more time to go through both before I can rate how good they areCONS- The e-books were sent to me by email, and it went straight into my spam inbox. Had to dig around to find them- This is just a personal preference, but I would have preferred to have a color option aside from a black ab wheel. However, I guess it is not a big deal for some peopleI would say though if you are a beginner - I would ease into the motion of rolling forward because it can be a little bit challenging. My girlfriend has never used an ab roller before, and she wobbled a little with her first try. But after about ten mins or so, she was able to stabilize herself when rolling it forward completely.So I think for a beginner, once you get the motion of rolling forward while being able to stabilize the ab roller… then you will hit your core pretty hard with this ab roller. Even for an intermediate and advanced user, this ab roller will give your six pack a good workout. This is not the first time I have bought a product from this company. So I have come to expect their high quality of customer services. Moreover, the fact you get a knee pad and two free e-books on nutrition and abs workout - this product is an absolute steal!!

  Good wheel. Seems hefty. The rubber edge seems very good and sturdy and can be used on all kinds of flooring. The bar that you hold into is sturdy and the grips are nice and soft... But not too soft. The reason for the 1 star shortfall is because the only thing holding the wheel on is the grips. So they can somewhat move off a bit as you see in the pics. Not so sure how others hold the wheel on but on this if the grips go bad there's nothing to hold it centered. Just fyi.

  This ab wheel is really nice.  I scoured Amazon for a wheel that didn't look flimsy and this thing seems really solid.  Very happy with this purchase!Pros:  I was worried it would be difficult to assemble as workout equipment can be sometimes, but it was crazy easy!You just slip the wheel and one handle on and you're done.  Took 5 seconds.  The wheel itself is a great width.  Other wheels seem like the 'tire' is harder plastic.  This 'tire' is very rubberized making it really non-slip on any surface.  I also like that the 'tire' is wider and had slightly rounded edges making it really stable when you working towards the side or bending at an angle for hitting your obliques.  Rolls very easily on any surface while still feeling really solid.  I've tried other ab wheels which just seem kind of flimsy, like the wheel moves side to side to much, and it makes for an unnerving exercise.  This one has no flimsiness when moving to the side.  I find it best to use on a large yoga mat though in case you fall on your face, ha!  The grip is comfortable enough.Cons: The only thing I think they could improve about the ab wheel is making the grip uniform squishiness throughout.  Maybe that's actually to allow for more friction so you don't slip, not sure.The extra knee pad seemed to slip on tile.  I tried it once and felt like my knees were going to slip out so I stopped using it.  Again, I just a yoga mat so my knees and the wheel stay on the same surface - I think that's important.Also, the e-books were a nice addition but honestly not very helpful if you know the basics about fitness.  I was expecting more alternative ab wheel workouts, but it's mainly general fitness tips and other ab exercises not using this wheel.  I have made up more ab wheel exercises up on my own just by changing up my knee positioning and the path of the wheel.  I'm getting nit-picky though, it might be helpful for some.Also, some of the workouts suggest that you do 5-10 minutes of ab wheel.  That's a crazy huge amount!  If you're doing in right, at the max intensity, you probably won't be able to do more than a minute. Watch some Youtube videos for proper technique.Overall, I'm very happy with this wheel and would definitely recommend it over others out there.One thing to note, I've seen this in the comments as a negative several times, ab wheels are not for everyone.  I consider myself to be at a fairly advanced fitness level and I can't do more than a handful of these in one set if I go down as far as I feel I can safely hold it.  If you're overweight, I think it'd be even harder.  You actually need a fair amount of shoulder stability in addition to keeping your core tight.  Makes for a great workout though if you can handle it!

  I started slow, not wanting to overdo, and I can quickly feel those abs being targeted. You feel the burn almost immediately, even with minimal extension. I would caution anyone who doesn't have an extensive workout routine to ease your way into this. If you try to do too much in the beginning, you'll overtax your muscles and, maybe, not want to continue. The wheel is fairly stable with its wide tread and, because it has a rubber coating, it doesn't slip. The grips are comfortable and seem to be sufficiently padded. Assembly is minimal and extremely simple. I haven't used the knee pad yet, but I think it will come in handy on hard surfaces. This one's a keeper. Washboard stomach, here I come. ;-)

  I play weekly, and have used every golf ball known to man and some women. in layman terms... the surface feels weird to newbies that are experienced with different coatings. It will feel almost rubbery or one guy even said ""spongy"" but dont let this mislead you. My typical drive is 290-315 with high end golf balls and this includes the SuperSoft. It is harder to slice/hook though not impossible to do. It will only reduce the amount of the spin on the ball, not get rid of it entirely. So try it have you havent yet. Its fun to drive, stick on the green, and put with.

It is soft and very strong, so far I have not had an issue with the velcro coming undone while it's on. I have it on all the time unless I'm sleeping, it fits over my clothes which is a big plus for me so its easier to adjust if I need to. For anyone wanting to know a rough size comparison I was a size 20/22 before pregnancy and currently a size 26 comfortably. I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone including my fellow plus size moms. 😁 The picture shows no belt on top and with belt on the bottom. I hope this review helps you.

  I had horribly debilitating pelvic pain that started in my second trimester. It wasn't just soreness, but a burning right at front where everything connects (pubic symphysis). I had tried all of the home methods of managing that pain including wearing supportive shoes, trying to keep knees together when changing positions, keeping a pillow in between knees when sleeping, etc.After putting this on the first time, I felt relief within 2 minutes. I wear it outside in the heat and it is still very breathable. I also keep it on to sleep.Life Pro Tip: Bring it to an OB/Gyn appointment and talk to your doctor about how you are wearing it to be sure you are using it correctly. You don't want to have it tight, and you want to make sure you wear it low around your hips, not high on your bump like the picture shows.

  I started having premature labor at 29 weeks. Every time I stood up my uterus would get hard (contractions), and it would get worse and worse the longer I stood. I would pretty much have contractions anytime I did anything. I started wearing this at about 31 weeks after being on bed rest for 2 weeks. This helped prevent contractions significantly. The first day I wore it, I noticed I was able to stand for significantly longer without having contractions.This can be worn under any of my regular clothes. I would recommend a thin cotton shirt underneath if it is really hot outside, but other than that it is comfortable. For others out there having the same issue, things that I have found to be helpful: drink water ( Im drinking about 3L/day +other things), laying on my left side, acupuncture, hot herbal tea, hot liquids in general, and  coconut water. The hot liquids have been super helpful in making the contractions stop- wait until it is just hot enough to not burn and then drink the whole drink fast. Coconut water helped because it replenishes some of the electrolytes your muscles (uterus) needs after drinking so much water. Acupuncture helps for about 3 days, so I would suggest getting it right before a more active day. Hope this helps someone out there!

  This belt is has been an absolute life saver for me over the past two years and is the one item I don't think I could have easily lived through while carrying twins.While having my first daughter, I worked as a full time teacher at a preschool with one and two year olds. I was on my feet for 8 hours a day in a very busy classroom, lifting and carrying toddlers and spending a good deal of time getting up and down out of the floor. I did this from before the time I became pregnant until 37 weeks, which is when our beautiful little girl arrived.During that pregnancy, this maternity belt provided me with a great deal of relief. I often felt that my ab muscles needed more support with all of the lifting and frequently suffered from low back pain as the day (and my pregnancy) progressed. This band gave me that much needed support and allowed me to feel much safer lifting 25 pound babies all day.I credit the extra support provided by this band for preventing diastasis recti, as I feel that it aided holding everything together, but I have no proof of that.Prior to purchasing this belt, I was using the Shrinkx Hips belt (because I had it) and wearing it slightly higher on my hips (but lower in the front) to give my belly a slight boost. Although that did work temporarily, it did not provide me with all day comfort and it's lack of flexion concerned me in regards to my baby's safety. At around 4.5 months, I opted to try this band based on reviews and what I felt was a very reasonable price.The AzMed band's wide, curved, mesh-like front is highly conducive to a pregnant woman's growing belly and flexes easily to allow room for growth while also supplying gentle (but tangible) support. Basically, I could breathe and move very easily in this belt without feeling pressure against my belly. The long Velcro band made it quick and easy to adjust the support level throughout the day as well. Washing and drying this band with my regular laundry did not appear to impair its durability in any way. It was a good purchase.Fast forward 13 months. I am now days away from expecting twins, and my appreciation for this band has grown exponentially (like my belly). I began wearing it again at around 4.5-5 months (like last time) where I used it basically the same as before... low on my belly, higher on my hips, sometimes folding the front in half to provide double support and lift to boost my lower belly, which tends to endure the most strain. Once again, the belt allowed me to feel safe moving and lifting my own baby while also feeling supported. My second pregnancy, however, was nothing like my first and this band went from being nice to necessary very quickly.At 20 weeks, I was diagnosed with a (very) short cervix and put on bedrest.At the time, my daughter was 8 months old and there was no way around picking her up or carrying her while my husband was at work. I wore this band very snugly around my lower belly, hoping to raise it enough to take even the tiniest bit off pressure off to avoid further shortening. My doctors (a team of wonderfully Maternal Fetal Medicine experts) assured me that it would not prevent further shortening but did encourage me to use it for comfort or support. In all of my weekly ultrasounds to measure cervical length, I was asked to take the band off, so I have absolutely no way of knowing the impact of wearing this band, and whether it took pressure off from helping lift my belly or added pressure from squeezing enough to cause some downward pressure, but I often wondered. More than anything, I believe this belt provided me with a little psychological support in addition to abdominal support. It made me ""feel"" safer, despite that I have no proof that I was.At 20 weeks, they weren't sure we would reach 24, then 28, then 32.... we are now 36 weeks and the doctors are discussing inducing us at 38 (for the well being of the babies - this is routine with twin pregnancies due to rising risk factors).At 32 weeks, my abdomen was as big as it ever got with my daughter and at 35, it became very uncomfortable to move. Unlike with my first pregnancy, I have developed diastasis recti at the navel and a few fingertips below. My umbilical area is trying to herniate. I have developed hydronephrosis (basically I have a swollen kidney caused by internal pressure), and my pelvis pops with the slightest movement. Rolling over in the bed has gone from slightly uncomfortable to near impossible (without ab strength) and takes me a minimum of 10 minutes. The pain of having 40ish pounds of weight shift from one side of my uterus to the other is quite striking. Getting out of bed at all shifts the pressure so intensely that it often triggers contractions that leave me doubled over for several minutes before loosening enough to walk. But, the bottom line is, I am still pregnant after 16 weeks of cervical shortening, and that is something to celebrate. It is also something I would have been much more uncomfortable doing without this band.This band supports my abdominal muscles, especially the ones that separated between my navel and pubic bone (which stay the most sore), and decreases the pain of walking and rolling over. I still have difficulty and pain rolling over at night, but the band holds things together well enough that I can roll over in a reasonable amount of time compared with before, and without as much strain. Walking to my doctor's appointments (located way inside of a busy hospital) is much easier, as the pressure from gravity feels much less. The contractions triggered by shifting movements are practically nonexistent with this band, since it holds things in place, and I believe that alone has helped us reach 36 weeks.For women worried about these bands restricting their growth... I am no doctor, but was reassured by a team of MFM doctors in a teaching hospital that it was safe. I also had weekly BPPs and tri-weekly growth scans and despite the tendency of twins to drop centiles after 28 weeks (and my first daughter being born under 10 percent), the twins have remained 50th percentile and above throughout this pregnancy despite continuous wear. I realize this is anecdotal, so please always ask your own doctor first.One last note... this band is not for postpartum use and would be absolutely ineffective for use as a belly binder. It is not a flat band that sits flush against a non-pregnant woman's body, but is curved outward at the mesh-like area to allow space for pregnant bellies. After birth, despite swelling and normal postpartum... stuff... the curvature is too much to provide any support, even when worn tightly. Hospital binders, the Belly Bandit, the Squeem... etc. are much stronger and provide the compression needed to hold things in place. (I used the Belly Bandit immediately postpartum, later moved into the Squeem and Shrinkx Hips, which is another story, but having used all of these, I can assure you that the AzMed will not help with these postpartum issues if that is what you are looking for).

  I had mixed emotions about this based on how scattered the reviews are. But, it is WORTH BUYING! It is soft, and fits perfectly. Some people said it rides up but if you fit it on properly it wont. It offers amazing support and eased the pain in my back from scoliosis and my belly pulling my spine forward more. It is also not visible at all under clothing. I am only 20 weeks but this will be helpful my entire pregnancy.

  I ordered two sets of this card game and after using them for several months with dissatisfaction I contacted the SET Enterprises to voice my complaint.  The ""yellow star"" card is difficult to read.  The card stock is thin.  There is no comparison to the quality of my original set purchased at Barnes and Nobles.  I learned that the two sets I purchased from Amazon on Feb.4, 2018 are counterfeit.

  A group of friends and I used to play Skip-Bo, then one day we tried 5 Crowns. Never went back. We’ve played 5 Crowns ever since. It’s a great rummy-style game.  We play with 3-6 players and it’s self-limiting on the time. There are 11 hands to a game and we usually finish in about an hour. Of course you can play more than one game if you like. We keep score but just laugh about the results - no pressure.

  While I don't usually like 'rummy-style' games, this game rates a 10 on my harsh scale.  It's rummy on steroids!Here's a tip that the manufacturer won't like me to share that will make your cards last 5-6 times longer.  After a hand is over, we put the used cards aside and just continue dealing from the unused cards.  People may complain that ""we used a lot of jokers (or the next wild card) already so we need to shuffle"" but after playing this way for years I can attest that it makes no difference at all because everyone is on equal footing.  I've challenged doubters to speak up if they notice one iota of difference in the play and I've had unanimous agreement that it made no difference.If playing two-handed, you'll only shuffle 3 times!  Once to begin, again after 8's are wild, and after either 11's or 12's (it varies).  3 times vs. 11 if you shuffle before every hand, greatly prolongs the life of the cards (even so, we've gone through about a dozen sets).

  A game doesn't get this many 5 star reviews without being a fun game to play... It is! So, I'm not going to talk at all about the fun we have playing it... I'm just going to dwell on the worst part of playing the game.It is a pain to shuffle all those cards! Split the deck in half and shuffle. Split the deck between everybody at the table and shuffle. Or (gasp!) just keep using the same deck for multiple games until you run out of cards. All have their downsides... Most notably, it takes a lot of time away from actually playing the game to fulfill the shuffling duties.My answer is to use an automatic (2 deck minimum) card shuffler. It speeds things along considerably; and it keeps folks that are ""shuffling challenged"" from running for the door! I found a hand cranked 2 deck model from CHH that works great. It ended up being a really cheap way to enjoy this game above its 5 stars rating for fun to play!An added bonus is it keeps the huge deck of cards in great shape. The cards don't develop that ""shuffled card bend.""But... you're still on your own for dealing.

  My 7 year old daughter fell in love with UNO after getting it as a Christmas gift and wanted to try some other card games.  Frankly, this is not one of her favorites of the 5 or so I bought her.  My thoughts are that this is because the game lacks a little pizzaz compared to some of the games really for kids (there aren't cute cartoon characters on the cards or anything), I think it is a bit hard for a 7 year old, and I think the keeping score over multiple hands doesn't appeal to the attention span of a 7 year old.I'm sure at this point your wondering why I gave this 5 stars?  Well, my wife and I actually really enjoy this game so while I debated 4 stars I decided to go with 5 for now (although see below about card quality).  This game is very similar to rummy but with a twist.  There are no 2s or Aces but there is a 5th suit and a lot of wild cards.  You basically play rummy starting with a 3 card hand, then 4 card hand, then 5 card and so on up to a 13 card hand.  You try to go out first.  If you don't you get one more turn to get rid of any 3+ card runs you have and those you can't lay, you get stuck with points (a low score is good) based on how high of a card you have.  At the end of the 13 card hand round, the lowest score wins.I like the game because a) you can play with two players and have fun-that seems to be pretty rare in card games in general and for me and my wife, it is a nice find b)I like rummy but find it a bit boring and this game jazzes up rummy enough to make it more interesting and c) it is not super complex and I find it relaxing to play (I will say in the 12 and 13 card hands it does get a little more complex mentally digesting all the card and possible runs you have, but it isn't bad).  It also moves fairly fast.  It takes us about 30 minutes to play through the 3-13 card hands.I will say, especially since I bought several card games at once and had something to compare to, I do not think these cards are very high quality.  They seem thin and don't have much of a sheen on them like they have that protective laquer type coating on them.  I wonder if they will wear well over time if we use them a lot.  One thing I do like is the game came in an appropriate sized box with a small tray for the cards in it.  A lot of these games come in much larger boxes than needed and still have no where to hold the cards and make the game harder to carry around to different households and store for no great reason.

  We love playing this game.  It is so easy and fairly quick.  And truly the game isn't over till the Kings Go Wild - though my mom (age 95) seems to win more often than any of us!  I got this for her for Christmas because we play it often, and she wants to play with her friends (they play cards once a week for hours at a time).  So, it's definitely for ages 8 - 99!!

  This is a fabulous card game, it's like rummy, but with 5 suits of cards instead of four.  The rules of the game are simple, and it's easy to pick up, yet the game is challenging, as each hand has a different wild card.  Starting with only 3 cards dealt, and 3's are wild, you play rounds up through kings (13 cards, kings are wild), and jokers are always wild.  The game moves quickly, and is addictive.  A person can be behind all game but still win in the final round.  This game was recommended to us and we are really glad we tried it.

  This tape, I don't even know where to begin!  My seamstress Diane introduced me to this tape to help eliminate back fat from my strapless dress along with that annoying bunch at the underarms.  It works and its amazing!!!  Every bride needs to know this trick.  You take the tape and, making sure that the first end doesn't extend above your dress line, you attach it to your problem area.  Then pull the tape downwards and/or out, depending on how you want the skin to smooth.  As you pull, press the tape onto your skin and smooth it down.  Like a charm!  I loved this dress but I was dismayed to see my rear reflection when I first tried it on.  Because of that I almost didn't choose it.  I read that the proper seamstress can cut the dress in a way to reduce the appearance of back fat, but this tape did that and allowed the dress to be nice and snug, without any weird alterations.  I had the tape on for several hours after each fitting and all day/night for my wedding.  I never felt it and it didn't rip out my hair when I went to take it off.  They should honestly market this tape specifically to the wedding industry and offer it in a variety of skin tones.  A large part of me feeling stunning in my dress and totally self confident was because of the way that this tape worked.  Thank you seems insufficient.

  We usually purchase rock tape directly from our chiropractor however when we ran out I figured I would just have some shipped to me so I ordered off amazon. I purchased the beige skin color tape and it’s much thinner and not as durable as what we usually use. It’s strange. It’s as if I bought a knockoff even though it’s says “Rock Tape” inbthe packagr and roll! It does not perform the same either. It felt more like KT tape. I definitely will not buy again.

  I separated my shoulder forty years ago, when kidnapped in Mexico.  I punched a couple guys to escape. Shoulder popped out and was hanging behind my head.The same shoulder was dislocated when my UPS shirt, hooked onto door handle and I hung outside the truck until I took my ink pen to tear the shirt.Shoulder weak now at 60.  My chiropractor recommended Rock Tape.  He put it on me at his office.  Three days later, I love this tape.My shoulder is weak. I can dislocate it in my sleep.  The tape holds my shoulder up. Giving muscles and tendons a rest.  I can still mountain bike 30 miles a day. I can still walk and kayak.Just ordered more. In bulk.

  This tape seems to be quality made, stretchy and supportive. HOWEVER this is for people out there who are super sensitive to EVERYTHING like me. I know it says hypoallergenic and blahblahblah but this made my skin break out in a rash and ended up with blood blisters within hours that ended up scarring:/ No i did not wear it for more than a few hours and yes I was stupid enough to try it twice and it happened TWICE! But it’s just bc I have super sensitive skin and have an allergy to latex, adhesives, food allergies, environmental allergies, etc. I get rashes when I wear ANY kind of bandaids so I shouldn’t have been surprised. I’m just writing this to warn other sensitive skin peeps.

  I’ve been PT for about 3 weeks. My trap muscle and neck are extremely inflamed and tense. I work in the healthcare field and this injury has been very painful.At every session they use Rock tape & rock sauce to alleviate some of the pain and it has been fantastic! I am extremely sensitive to medication so I’ve had to deal with the pain in more natural ways.  The tape helps correct my posture as well. I decided to purchase some for home since I only see the PTA two times a week.My skin is also very sensitive but this has not caused any rash or irritation for me. It does hold up well in the shower but mine tends to become stretched out after sleeping. I toss and turn so  I’m sure the tape rubbing on the sheets causes this.Honestly this has brought me the most relief out of all of my treatments and I highly recommend it!

  I absolutely cannot believe how amazing this has worked on my aching joints & neck/back pain that I get due to an old injury. This stuff is for real! I'm nearly 53 years old and have put my body through a lot lately with remodeling & my knees were hurting so much as well as my back and neck. I'm in pretty good shape and work out, but I guess I pushed my body to the limit so when my physical therapist put this on a recent injury site (because of muscle spasms), it worked so well on alleviating those daily muscle spasms, so I bought more to try on other aches and pains. I was shocked it actually helped and I was able to reduce my pain medicine. 🙌 I love the chart that is included on how to apply in different areas, too. I can't believey doctor never recommended this years ago for my neck/back injury. Glad my physical therapist introduced me to this tape.

  I've been dealing with unbearable pain on my left foot due to plantar fasciitis and Morton's neuroma for months. I was constantly stressed and anxious; I couldn't wear shoes other than sneakers, envied people around me who could wear their seasonal booties, and became afraid to do any outdoor activities that I normally love doing. Nothing seemed to work... I tried compression socks, massagers, custom orthotics, sturdy shoes, religiously stretching morning and night... still the pain was there.It wasn't until I started taping my foot daily that I felt any improvement and relief. A couple weeks of taping later- now my left foot has never felt better. It's incredible. I had my doubts, but this experience had converted me into a true believer.My only wish is that the tape was more water resistant than advertised. Unfortunately, the tape comes off every time I shower so I go through the roll pretty quickly. Still, it's brought me utter relief and I couldn't be more thankful.

   Best sticking, stretching, supporting KT tape I’ve tried yet. It’s worth every penny. Better than the national athlete sponsored stuff. Better than the “original” KT Tape BY FAR! Water resistant & grays a lot less than others. It’s not as hard on my sensitive skin as others, but I still use a barrier cream because I’m super-sensitive to adhesives.

  We purchased this putting green for my 7 year old son to practice on. The mat arrived rolled up in a large box that we saved for storage. The majority of the bottom has a non-slip grip so it stays put floors. The last 18"" of the green slowly inclines just over an inch. The mat easily unrolled and laid flat though there was an area of slight separation between the non-slip grip and incline foam padding that'll need to be re-glued.The putting green is slightly smaller than advertised. The company has it listed as being 9' x 3' however my mat is 8 feet 6.25 inches in length and 33.5"" at it's widest point. I imagine it was just easier to round up, but I thought it'd mention it either way.Other than that, I think this is a very nice, simple putting green and my son loves that he can pull his mat out and play golf whenever he feels like it.

  Outstanding putting mat, especially for the price. As us golfers know, putting typically makes up roughly 40% of all shots, so every stroke gained counts.  This mat is high quality, runs well, and has a sticky backing so it doesn't slide around on my tile floors. I love practicing my 5-9 foot putts as these can be VERY costly on the course.The only reason I rate this a 4/5 is because mine came a bit wrinkled on the top left side. Assuming yours is received without wrinkles it would be a perfect 5/5.Thank you for reading and rating my review!

  I'm a low handicap player and I've bought many practice aids before, always to be disappointed.  This is the best $35 I've ever spent on my game.  It's the perfect size to fit in my living room and roll some putts while I watch tv.  As some previous reviewers mentioned, I keep mine in the box it was shipped in.  I've had it about a month now and every time I pull it out, it always rolls perfectly flat.  The holes are the right size and I love the little upslope.  I would say this runs about a 10.5 on the stimpmeter, so it's a little faster than your average public course typically rolls, but it's definitely not Augusta (as I would imagine).  I use it on old hardwood floors and it provides extra slope to my putts, but the balls don't get stuck in the gaps on the boards.I've also recently gotten my 7 year old daughter into golf.  We have putting contests with this product and she absolutely loves it.  We both have fun coming up with creative putts to make the other hit.  Since I've had this, I've been trying to use it about 3 times per week and I've already seen a drop in my average number of putts.  This green is large enough to allow diagonal putts as well, so you're not always hitting the same putt every time.  If you're on the fence with this, go for it.  You'll be extremely pleased.  (I paid for this product and was not asked to do a review)

  Anyone who needs a true review from a real golfer, here it is.So easy to line up a putt and give yourself a true feel and a great line. I slapped down a chalk line for 6 foot putts. I wake up every morning and sink 5 in a row and go about my day. This has helped me soooooo much on the course. It’s made my short putts easy. The 1 star reviews here are jokes.  Before I buy anything on amazon I look at the reviews, especially the 1 stars too see what people have too say. But I went for it and this is a steal. My friend has a $200 set up and this exceeds it. It does the job and more. I have it set up on a wood floor and it rolls true.Buy it and learn the short ones. A 300 yard drive counts the same as made 6 foot putt.

  It's probably the worst product I have purchased through Amazon so far. I opened the box with no wrapping on the mat. It was too long for the box so the top part of mat was folded down . When I unrolled the mat , it is absolutely terrible . It was full of cat hair all over the mat both front and back not to mention the foam on the back was broken . It has been used in a house with cats playing on the mat all the time. I have tried to use roller to clean the hair but half way through I gave up because looking closely I saw cat hair is everywhere on the green part . I'm returning it. What a mistake .

  seems to be okay. about the same quality as the one my buddy paid $60 for. be careful your putter doesn’t have a bunch of dings/scratches on the bottom as it’ll snag on this material. wish i could find one about double this length tho for a reasonable price.UPDATE!!!!so i bought this to try to practice enough to eliminate 3 putts, nothing is more frustrating than having birdie putts all day and ending up with bogeys. prior to this i shot below 80 maybe a dozen times in my life, 78 was my best round ever at easy courses. i’m 38 been playing since i was 12. member at a tough course for 2 years now. before this i typically shot mid to high 80s sometimes low 90s on a really rough day. after getting this and practicing i’ve shot under 80 5 times this year and beat my best round with a 76!!! i bought a new putter too but i’m giving all the credit to practicing on this mat.

  I bought this as a git for my nephew, the mat itself looks great, however, it just comes in the shipping box, there's no item packaging or case.  So storage will seem to be an issue. You can try to reuse a the shipping box, but that isn't super convenient, nor does it look very attractive sitting in your house in a used cardboard box.  I ordered a yoga carrying sling in hopes that it will allow him to roll it up and keep it out of the way in a nice(er) way.

It just isn't large enough for the use I had in mind for it.  However, there is no excuse for lying to the public about the contents of the box.

  These All-Health bandages are just right for the typical wounds I get on my elderly skin, either from bumping into something or from cat scratches, which require great care to avoid cellulitis.  The outside measurement is 3x4"" and the pad is 2x3"", and I also like the light weight, four-sided adhesion, and antibiotic protection.  I use Hibiclens Skin Cleanser and iodine on fresh wounds, and a touch of castor oil on the adhesive edges to make the bandages easier to remove, as they hold a good seal on my skin.  I think adhesion depends on skin type--young or old, oily or dry.  The four-sided adhesive stays put all day and also in bed so don't need extra protection at night.  Good news for sensitive skin: the bandage comes off more easily when wet.  The price is good as well compared to the better-known brands, and I see nothing sub-standard about them.

  This bandage has as the active antibacterial ingredient Benzalkonium Chloride 0.1%. Well, I guess my skin did not like this chemical.  When I took off the bandage after 24 hours, I was left with a huge red area the exact size of the bandage which is 3"" x 4"". It has been 3 days and it is still as red as can be and very tender to the touch. In areas it looks like blood is trapped below the surface of my skin. I see a Doc today.

  Normally I am skeptical of any bandages insofar as adhesion but I always give one's (sizes) I use that I am not familiar with a try. These really have quality adhesion which is what I am always concerned with. Bandages falling of is not my cup of tes.

  This turned out to be a terrible product for me. My skin reacted badly to something about it. Within about 30 hours (the second bandage) I began to feel significant pain. I removed the bandage and its entire shape was “printed” on my skin in a serious rash with broken skin over most of the area. It is now about 12 hours later and after cleaning it and applying cortisone, the rash has not improved much and still hurts quite a bit.  I have never had a problem like this from a bandaid before and I suggest it is not something you want to risk dealing with.

  Quite possibly the best bandage I've ever used. It's on the side of my knee, usually movement means adhesion will suffer, this bandage stays fully adhered through a full workout (pictures uploaded) and when it's time to take it off, it comes off without too much fuss. I usually don't get excited about bandages but these go above and beyond. (I did shave the area)

  I've tried several different kinesiology tapes, here are the results of my head-to-head comparisons...In order of stretchiness:KT Tape Pro: Super stretchy spandex-type material. Dries super fast. Breathes excellently even in multiple layers.KT Tape: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape H2O: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape: Moderate-elastic content cotton. Takes the longest to dry but that's still fast. Not very breathable, can feel slightly stifling in multiple layers.In order of stickiness:Rocktape H2O: Can be repositioned, and will stick just as well after repositioning. Sticks to tape well. Can be uncomfortable to remove.Rocktape: Can be repositioned, but loses some stickiness each time. Edges tend to peel up. Doesn't stick to tape very well. Okay removal.KT Tape Pro: Can be repositioned, but won't stick for more than a day if you do.Sticks to tape well. Easily removed.KT Tape: Cannot be repositioned, edges tend to peel. Sticks to tape adequately well. Seems more painful to remove than others.In order of longevity:Rocktape H2O: 3+ days. Stays put until you take it off.KT Tape Pro: 2-4 days. Once you get it stuck on, it stays. Less peeling than Rocktape.Rocktape: 2-4 days. Edges tend to peel up on day 2, so you've got to trim it down.KT Tape: 1 day. Edges and entire parts of strips peel up almost immediately.In order of support:Rocktape: Very stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a lightly structured brace. Useful for areas where you need a lot of stability like knees and ankles.Rocktape H2O: Stable support.Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression brace. Useful for areas where you need both stretch and support, better adhesion and superior stretch offers excellent 'massage' for sore muscles.KT Tape: Moderately stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a compression sleeve.KT Tape Pro: Light to moderate support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression sleeve. Useful for areas where you need flexibility first, particularly well-suited to wrists and fingers.

  I never leave bad reviews. But the fact that this is a so-called “Amazon Choice,” is just ridiculous. So I’m going to tell you about this “authentic” KT tape with Amazon’s seal of approval.I frequently buy the authentic KT tape at CVS. (I’d call my husband addicted, but he wouldn’t.) So I stumble upon this product. Hmm, it would be so much more convenient and definitely cheaper, so I bought four rolls. The result is I have to return four rolls.While I have both versions in front of me, here’s the skinny: This tape is thinner and it feels different - the texture of the fabric is not as silky. This tape does not adhere for as long as or as well as the KT tape purchased at CVS. This tape tears pretty easily and by experience, I’ve found that real KT tape is almost impossible to tear. And to round it all out, it gave my husband a slightly red, kinda itchy rash where the tape was applied and and for about a half-inch outline. (This condition generated a lot of complaints from him, but cleared up with a benadryl plus a nap.)So buyer beware! Don’t end up like me - at the post office.

  The product description clearly states KT Tape Original...It was an Amazon Warehouse item and the box would be torn but the product inside unaffected. Well as you can see in the picture, it's a KT tape original box but the tape itself is a very very cheap imitation. Additionally, the product was listed as 20 pre cut strips, I received a continuous roll of crap. Before I decided to the product, I gave it a try in hope that it would be comparable to KTTape. Far far from it. Absolutely useless. I have been using therapeutic sports tape for years, There are plenty of brands beside KT which are of good quality including store brands. What I recieved from Amazon Warehouse is best described as cheap imitation chinese junk. Not worth the $5.00 I paid for sure!As a side note, a friend of mine had the exact same experience with this product switcheroo by Amazon. I cannot be bothered to waste my time and energy returning this item. Very disappointed. I feel duped.I order many items from Amazon but this experience is changing my opinion of the company.It would be nice to hear from Amazon and get their side of the story.

  If you're looking for a novelty for an evening beach party or something of the kind this will be okay. If you have a toddler that loves to bounce around a ball everyday for a bit this isn't the best option. Blow it up tight and in 24 hours of sitting there doing nothing it will be limp and have to blow more air into it... The last ball we had from a different manufacturer lasted for over a year of regular use and only needed air with temp changes. I wish there was a BIFL option that would work for us. There is 1 out there but it's too heavy for indoor use. Best option is to buy something that will last as long as possible.

  Quality issues. I ordered beach balls of different sizes from different vendors. These are the worst. The plastic is thin and the seams are bonded poorly. The ball has little ripples and and deformities when inflated. It's not nice and smooth and round like other beach balls. 2 of the 3 I received also immediately started leaking. The kids were disappointed because 20"" is the perfect size for tossing around and playing.

  Headline sounds off based for a beach ball review.......I know.  But let me explain.  We have had a lot of cold rainy days this winter.  Our 3 year old grandson has been ""stuck"" inside as have we.  He loves to throw balls but being 3 his aim isn't always the greatest.....especially when he's throwing my yoga ball which had become the ball of his choice because of the size.  As you can imagine, a large yoga ball can knock many things over in it's path.  Of particular concern to me were my lamps - which I have had for a long time, weren't cheap, and I adore them.  In an effort to keep my possessions in tact, but still indulge his desire to throw a ball inside, I began looking for alternatives.  Of course Amazon had the answer.  We ordered these beach balls - which came in a set of three.  They are nice and light - almost fluffy if you will - and very bouncy.  They easily bounce off of everything.  He loves them and they are fun to play with - even for adults.  If these bite the dust we will surely order the same ones again.

  The pack came with three balls that were 12 inches, not 20 inches as advertised. One leaked air right out of the package and I couldn't use it. One lasted a day and then split at the seam. The last one lasted a few days before it split. The previous beach ball I used for over a month and eventually was punctured by a tree branch, so I don't think it's my fault here for being too rough with them.

  My son always loves to play traditional Monopoly since he was five. But the traditional Monopoly takes too much time to play and have too many pieces (a lot of different dollar bills, green color houses, red color hotels, etc), the rest of family (parents, uncles and aunts) all hesitate to play with him. It takes forever to play Monopoly and have tons of things to take care of.Now, I found this Monopoly Deal Family Card game and can't believe how much fun this game is within around 15 minutes for a round. This is such a great design to combine strategy, luck and excitement for school age kids and grown up together. My son just turns 9 years old and loves to play the set because he can think about different strategies to try to make the wining sets. Now the grown up also have tons of fun because this game makes you think also provides lots of surprise. The only huge bonus is you can bring this card game to any place easily since it eliminate all the paper money and lots of pieces. The price is really inexpensive. I will buy this game as gifts to all my son's friends for them to play with their families. This is how much I love this game! Highly recommend!

  No words can describe how grateful I am to have bought this game. For the last few years it's been incredibly difficult getting our family of four together and happy, even during holidays. Yesterday night for Christmas I pulled out monopoly deal and for the first time in ages ALL 4 of us wanted to stay in the same room for more than the usual! We laughed, laugh-cried, and played almost 15  ""one more round""s (hah!). It's super fun and easy to learn. Even my mom who doesn't know english well was able to catch on, and she ENJOYED it too (she usually despises games). Dad wasn't retreating to man cave, and little brother wasn't grumpy or rushing to see friends. Everyone wanted to keep playing and conspire over who to kill next. If you ever want to see mid-20 and mid-50 year olds acting like children again, this is the perfect game for you. I am SO GLAD I bought this game.

  Wish I'd thought up a pyramid -marketing scheme related to this - I'd be rich!!! I've introduced a bunch of family and friends to this and they introduced it to others!  It's spreading!Love this game! It's easy to play- but certainly best if players are at least 9/10 years old coz it's not a typical board game. Rules sound a but off to read but the first time you play it , you'll get it all figured out.It's a lot of fun and very, very addictive. You can start doing variations after a year of playing it to mix it up but it's still fun. I've had to but multiple packs because I either end up giving it away or wearing out my deck!Get it! Now!

  This is one of my favorite gamesWhen we play with new people we always caution the the first round will be more of a learning round, but it's really easy to pick up.You can play with up to five players, which we have done before, but I think it's a little much and I find the center deck depletes pretty quickly. I think four players is the sweet spot. We've also been thinking about adding another deck and seeing how that will playWe recently took an international trip and brought this along to play in the airport while we were waiting around and it was greatAs another reviewer mentioned, there are some scenarios that are not explained in the rules - for instance, we weren't sure if a ""just say no"" card could be played against another ""just say no card"", to settle it we ended up emailing Hasbro and to our surprise they emailed us back pretty quickly with the answer! (according to Hasbro, you can use a ""just so no"" card against another"")You can definitely play a round in 15 minutes, but we've had some rounds that have lasted a little longer. Overall it's a really enjoyable game and we spend most of the time laughing while we play

  When I bought the Monopoly Card Game it was because friends had it and had taught us to play it. We thought it would be a great game to have in our camper. So here it is March and pulled it out to play for the very first time. Tore the wipers off had our friends here to play. When we did things started to look funny. There was not a set of any of the properties. We got things like 2 electric companies but no water works, or 4 railroad cards but 2 different railroads not 4. And so on.

  Whenever I suggest teaching Monopoly Deal to a new group of people, they expect it to be similar to the board game. But it's definitely not! This card game is awesome. It requires a bit of strategy and a bit of luck. It's fast-paced and sometimes frustrating, but it's always a good time. Super high replayability so it never gets stale or boring like its board game predecessor. Overall, five stars. Highly recommend.

  When you find a good product, you stick with it.........and I've been using this here in Arizona,land of all the harmful UV rays that just love to dry out rubber and plastic and make life miserableon your car or boat.  I have even used it on our shade cloth screens we have on our windows torefreshen the faded look to almost new.  Any car with a sunroof/moonroof needs this product.The rubber seals and gaskets just bake and cook and all rubber has oils in it.  303 blocks the UVrays and penetrates the rubber pores.  My wife has a 2003 Honda Accord with a sunroof and therubber seal around the edge stiil looks factory new.  I use it on tires and interior plastic and aroundglass on any rubber I can find.  And it DOES NOT leave that nasty shiney oily look and feel like someother products.  My wife's Honda is a testament to the product and being a user for over 15 years,I stand by it.

  I gave 3 stars since it restored faded plastic to a nice rich color, but removed 2 stars since it seemed to rinse off immediately after rain, defeating the purpose.I bought this initially for my car, to keep the interior panels looking like new and UV protected, as well as to use on some outer trim to preserve the black color.I first decided to try using it to restore some faded outdoor plastic furniture - you can see from my photos that it did a great job making the faded vinyl look like new. This formula isn’t sticky, greasy, or waxy - as long as you don’t use too much, it’s dry to the touch pretty much immediately. I also appreciate that it has virtually no fragrance. I sprayed directly on the chairs, sprayed a bit on a microfiber cloth, and then wiped it in. If you use a bit too much and it starts to look shiny, you can simply use a dry microfiber to buff some of it off. In smaller spaces where you’re worried about over-spay, I would spray it onto a cloth only rather than the surface itself. I was highly impressed, and wiped down all chairs, a table set, and our vinyl door. They all ended up looking brand new……Until the next morning. It rained just a little bit overnight for an hour or two, and I went out to find that the chairs, which had looked brand new the afternoon prior, were back to looking faded and now also had a spotty appearance due to the rain, as you can see in my photo. The chairs had hours and most of the night to sit out and let the product soak in before it rained, so I don't think timing was the issue.I really wanted to love this product because it appeared to work SO well, but how effective can it really be at protecting against UV fading if most of it rinses off after a light rain? I spent a couple hours wiping down all that furniture, and don’t want to have to do it again every time there's inclement weather. I’ll continue using this for my original intended purpose - to wipe down the interior/trim/floor mats of our cars to keep it looking black - but probably wouldn’t bother with anything outdoor like patio furniture again.

  I don't understand how this works but it really does a great job! I have 1992 BMW e30 with faded interior and grills. After reading so much about this, I gave it a try and I am glad I did! This thing is simply magical! It leaves a film of silicone like protection on the surface. I used it on my leather seats, dash, tires and front grills and they came out perfect as brand new! The good thing is that this film is not oily unlike many other brands; it drys and protects the surface as well as adds a shiny touch.The best direction I found out useful is spray a lot on the surface..literally make it wet and leave for about an hour. You can also dampen a towel and use it to spread around the dashboard but it has to be wet! Do not worry; the surface will absorb and dry; whatever is remaining, simply wipe away with paper towel. My grills were grayed because of the age of the car, it applied three times and they came out black just like brand new! Make sure to wash the area perfectly before applying this magic!

  First off this product has thousands of favorable reviews, so a lot of folks like it.  I bought this product to enhance my new 2020 golf cart.  I applied it to the black ABS trim and bumpers and it did make the black stand out.  I then did my entire 80” black plastic top,, it put a low lustre sheen on it which is pleasing to me.  I then did all my seats front and back. I then did the floorboard which is covered with a black textured vinyl mat.  Honestly this product appears to be much like Armor All.  My only concern now is everything is super slippery.  The slipperiness does repel dirt and dust.  Here is my major complaint.  I have large oversized tires, tall and wide, on my golf cart so I went and treated the sidewalls as well.  Also treated the black plastic sleeve on the steering column which covers some wires.  After treating my entire vehicle it squeaks everywhere. The front bench seat now squeeKs with every bump. The steering column squeaks every time you turn the wheel.  The ABS plastic fenders squeak where they are attached to the fiberglass body. The back bench seat squeaks where it sits atop the fiberglass frame.  I got carried away and did our front porch swing and this morning I slipped out of it when I tried to get in.  This product is three times the cost of Armor All and twice as slippery.  Aerospace Slick-um.

  I didn't intend to buy this...Neither did anyone else in the house.  It just popped up in my cart and my wife thought ""Oh, I guess he wants a hat.""  Turns out when I gave my mom a phone three months ago she never logged into her own account and was trying to buy this for my dad.  Mine, now.The material seems pretty solid. The brim is absolutely huge and kept the sun off my neck while I was outside today.  I like the netting on the sides of the hat, too.  Kept my head nice and cool.  Also, I have a massive head and the hat fit just fine.  It is also adjustable with some elastic in the back.  The thing even has a chin strap for windy days.I'm actually kinda happy we got this.TLDR - My wife got me a hat I didn't want, and it's actually really comfortable and I'm keeping it.

  Okay.  So I bought this hat in anticipation for a new job that I was taking.  I started working construction in California.  What that means in English is that I am working outdoors in 100+ degree weather, with heavy steel toe boots on.I needed a hat to keep the sun out of my face.  I did not want a cowboy hat.  I did not want a straw hat.  I did not want a baseball cap.  I wanted something neutral and functional.This hat has exceeded my expectations to the point where I am writing a review.  I am doing so without compensation, without being asked, without anything other then the fact that this hat has SAVED me from the sun.Now.  The back rim does not completely cover my neck.  The side rim does not necessarily work for guarding against the sun while driving.  However, it stays on well, is fairly comfortable (and I am talking many, MANY hours of wearing this thing), and dries quickly from wetness (um, sweat, I sweat a LOT.)I will go so far as to say, I will likely purchase a spare.  This will show how important this thing has become to me as a ""tools of the trade.""  I live in fear that I will lose this thing.  I FEEL it when I am working outdoors and do not have it.  I will take it with me ""just in case.""  So yeah.  I'm buying another.

  I was not sure about this hat when it arrived, but when I realized you can adjust the band around your head I now wear it everywhere. Dog park, farmers market, doing chores, you forget you have it on and it keeps the sun off. Really like it!Update: 8/2020 This is my favorite hat and I own ones from Patagonia, San Diego Hat Co and others. You can wash it- but i did not put it in dryer. The brim is perfect width and sturdiness (no flopping).

  I like the hat alright but the green/grey hat fades to a tannish orange color around where it absorbs sweat. This started to happen right away. I've only had the hat for about a month now and it looks pretty bad but when I'm wearing it all of me looks pretty bad because I'm working in the yard so I really don't care much. I have a pretty big head and the hat fits me just fine.UPDATE JUNE 18, 2018. Originally gave the hat 3 stars because of discoloration. The manufacturer contacted me and provided a new hat in the Khaki color free of charge and I have not had the same problem with this hat. It does appear to be a different type of fabric and fits a little differently but still a good hat.. Changing my review to 5 stars for excellent customer service and a decent hat overall.

  Love the hat!  The brim is flexible, but not flimsy.The sun protection is there from both the SPF and the width of the hat itself.My only gripe would be that it is a bit tight on my head at the opening.  I don't blame the hat for this, as every head is sized and shaped differently, but if you have a larger head, be aware that this ""might"" not fit you well if you like a looser fitting hat.The reason that I bring this up, is that you have an adjustable chin strap / cord (whatever it's called) that should keep the hat on your head if it was a looser fit.Great hat!!!

  My son hat was delivered quickly. I am extremely satisfied with the weight and feel of this hat. It is lightweight and it feels very sturdy. It’s wide and will keep the sun off of my face. It is a great price and offers sun protection up to 50 SPF.  I can’t wait to try it out. I ordered a dark grey hat.

  Brim nice and stiff unlike those annoying floppy type of wide brim hats.I have an average head and it fits me great.  There's a cord around the outside with a little adjuster kind of thingie.  But there's also a couple tabs of webbing inside that you can tie to adjust fit.  I've used for 4-5 days and adjustment seems to work good so far.I spent a lot of time looking for a wide hat that provides a lot of sun protection, stays on well, and doesn't obscure my vision.  I think my search is ended.  Very pleased.

  Oh my goodness, WHY had no one ever told me that this product existed? I came across these while browsing knee sleeves. I have knee sleeves and have had different brands through the years, the latest being ""copper fit"", and they are okay but aren't as stable as I need. When I saw these, I was intrigued enough to wonder if they worked. After I ordered them, I was talking to a friend that said they had used these years ago and they worked good. The day they arrived I went to the store without opening up the package yet. While in the store, my knee gave ALL THE WAY out and I almost fell underneath the cart, thank goodness I was holding on at the time. Now, my knee has gone out from time to time, but NEVER like this, and it kept going out the rest of the trip. As soon as I got home I put this on, and I cannot believe the difference it made! This thing is amazing!!! I tested it and walked around outside every which way I could, and it made my knee stable and not ONCE did it go out! It kept acting like it wanted to, but the ring stopped it in it's tracks! I LOVE my knee ring and I will never go out without it again! This is 10x better than a sleeve and will fit over or under your clothes. What I really love is the ability to tighten or loosen it to specifically fit YOU. I can walk so confident now! Thank you Ipow and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

  I've only been using this a short time but absolutely love it so far! I've had two knee surgeries in the last 7 months, so I purchased with the intent to relive pain on my fat pad/ patellar tendon area. I've also used the second band on my quad (probably not what it's made for) simply to apply pressure to that area in hopes itll relieve the pain I'm having there. So far I've strictly used it at home and in public when I need the extra stability, and so far it's helped tremendously!

  I am 30 years old and I have chondromalacia patella (runner's knee) in both of my knees due to a congenital condition, and severe arthritis in the right one. After been rushed into a surgery on my right knee by my orthopedist --and his scary sense of urgency, without a clear explanation of my condition and my options-- I had an injury that nobody believed that deserved attention. After a year, it was almost impossible for me to walk or even get out of the bed without severe pain. Tired of my orthopedist suggestions (more surgeries and injections), I did my own research on specialized books and medical literature, just to find out that instead of that surgery, I just needed physical therapy, in addition to any kind of knee support that felt right to me. So I stopped listening to my orthopedist, I bought these bands, and I started to work on my quadriceps. Since the very first day using these bands it was like a miracle. I could stand up without pain and started walking as if nothing had happened. Then a physical therapist explained me that these little guys just gave my knee caps and muscles the pressure and support that they needed. He also told me that eventually I will not need them if I keep working on my quadriceps. These bands, obviously, do not solve my general problem. My condition is degenerative, but now I know how to buy me more quality years before the knee replacement.I just have two complains:-The bands are loosing strength pretty fast, but that has happened with any other type of knee support that I had in the past (because I started to use other type of sleeves or braces since I was 14 years old).-They are bulky and make impossible to wear jeans on them. But I can live with that.Overall I am really happy that I found this product and that I decided to deal with my problem by myself.UPDATE (June 19th, 2017):I don't need to use these guys anymore on a regular basis. I worked hard on my quadriceps, and after a couple of months I didn't need the support. Now I am going to buy my second pair because I lost them on a trip. I only carry them when I know that I will be walking all day long, but it is mostly to have some peace of mind because I barely use them now.

  I have suffered from chronic knee pain while running for years now after experiencing an injury. With running being one of hobbies, I thought I’d never run again without being in extreme pain. These little contraptions have changed my life.. I now run without even the slightest pain in my knee... the only thing is that it’s kinda uncomfortable without long pants on. But that’s a sacrifice I’m willing to take for no pain. I’d highly recommend

  I have never had knee pain (played competitive soccer for 20+ years or while running). At age 32, I ran my first marathon in San Francisco and was training about 5 days a week. I started getting runner's knee when training got up to at 16-18 miles (approximately 3-4 weeks prior to the full marathon). I stopped running for approximately 3 weeks. I started wearing these as I started working my mileage back up and I also started to do quad exercises and foam rolling more frequently.While I can't say with certainty that there's any proof that these things helped me, what I can say is I wore them for the full marathon and only had a little chafing on my medial knee area and I didn't notice the chafing until mile 20. Enclosed is a picture of them at mile 25.

  These knee braces definitely help a lot. I was doing morning work outs which included jumping jacks and I couldn't have done it without this product as I felt no pain in my knees while using them. My husband had somehow injured his knee while a work and was still aching when he got home. I gave home one of these braces which he slept with and woke up with no pain at all the next morning.

  I had just received my order of these large bandages when I missed a stair and landed on my knee.  My bad knee.  I had a moment of ""be careful what you shop for"" when I realized the big, skinned wound was perfect for trying the new bandages.  And boy, have they been great!  If I didn't have to clean and air the scrape, I think one would have lasted days.  So, either a gentle spirit was looking out for me when I was inspired to buy these bandages, or a mischievous spirit tripped me on that last stair creating the need for same.  Hmmm...

  I need a large bandage to cover up a healed wound on the back of my neck that was caused by the negligence of a neurosurgeon not placing a drain when he did a relatively minor neurosurgical procedure. Now I have a big indentation on the back of my neck because the wound had to close from the vertebrae on out. I bought these to cover that big scooped out place when I’m out in public. Well, these bandages just don’t stick well to my skin. And I don’t perspire much. I don’t think there is enough adhesive around the edges to hold it in place all that well. I believe someone at that company should re-engineer their product.Although the cost wasn’t high, since they didn’t work, they were NOT cost effective.

  The size is true to packaging. The problem I have, and it's a major one, is that the bandage will not stayed here to the skin for more than a couple of hours. This is most definitely true if it is on an area of the skin that moves a lot such as a knee or elbow joint. I am now sorry I bought two boxes.

  Very STRONG. It actually leaves red marks on my back for a week after ripping it off. I had a mole removal on my back and whenever I moved I could feel the bandaid on my back. It’s not that flexible because the adhesive is so STRONG whenever I move I feel like the hairs on my body are ripping off. Ha it does its job. Just not comfortable on my back. It could also be because the healing process is bothersome as well. It’s hard to tell.Very thick bandaid too. It would definitely absorb any small cut. I would suggest this if you’re looking for a bandaid that will STAY ON haha!

  These bandages are well made and are not too sticky making them easy to remove when changing them.  The fabric is strong and will not fall apart even under extreme conditions.  Since they are fabric and not waterproof I recommend changing them at least once a day to prevent infection.  They are also underpriced 30 bandages for less than the price of the name brand.  It was the price that added one star to the four stars I otherwise would have given this product.

  I tried these because of positive reviews & cost savings but no idea why they exist unless they've changed, because they don't stick.  The pad has a plastic coating which I guess is OK in some cases to keep it from sticking to the wound but it may not be absorbent when needed.  I'd include that info if it would stay put longer than 3 seconds.My skin was clean & dry and I pressed it firmly into place & held it there for a bit.  It was on my elbow but we also tried one on my husband's shin, where it stayed longer but still came off.In pics with 2, the bandage with gauze pad all the way across is Bandaid Flex Fabric.I'm sticking with Bandaid brand.  They may cost more but I've used flex fabric type for years with no issues.  I also prefer the pad to go all the way across.  If this brand fixes the issues, I'll reconsider.

  Fits well. Provides excellent support. There are three belts. Can be worn alone (lightest support) or all together (maximum support). I usually wear two belts to be able to sit and moved around comfortably. These were really helpful when I started to exercise again after giving birth. I got the medical clearance from my doctor, but my abdominals were so week and belly skin so floppy, that I needed something to help hold everything together. I like wearing the belts to bed as well and wake up to flatter tummy. I've tried several different products from belly bandit to corsets. I liked these the best because they were a good mix of effective and comfort. Of course no compression garment is truly comfortable, but I can live with this.

  This product is fantastic! I didn’t use it with my first pregnancy, the picture on the left. I used it after having surrogate twins and I’m way smaller and feel more put together after using this. I only wear it about 50% of the time. I didn’t follow the instructions, instead I just started wearing all three parts one day after vaginal delivery. My only complaint is that they move a bit when I sit down or bend over. Not a lot, but I notice it. I wish there was a rubber strip or something on the edges to hold it in place better.

  This has been amazing at helping me get my body back! I’ve only used the belly belt for several hours each day (I don’t sleep with it on) starting 4 days after my c section. The after picture is only 6 days later! I wish I had put it on sooner because it really offers the support my stomach needs. Once my incision heals more I’ll add the other parts.Edit: I loved this product for immediately following my c section. Baby is 3mos old now and I don’t wear it at all anymore. I’m just focusing on my diet and workouts now that I’ve been cleared by my doctor. Plus this is a little too big now.I did have a before/after picture posted that a lot of people seemed to find helpful but it was stolen to advertise a completely different product so I’ve deleted it.

  I'm six weeks postpartum and I have LOVED these bands! I followed the guidance (wearing the first band days 1-7, adding the second band in week two) and I plan on adding band 3 in the upcoming weeks. I don't wear them all day every day but have tried to wear them when I can and I think it has significantly helped in my shrinking back down.Everyone is different and bounces back differently but I personally was back at my pre-baby weight and wearing my old clothes again by week three and four. I owe part of that to wearing these bands I think.I also got an exercise waist band (I didn't want to sweat all over these while walking and exercising) and that's aided in the same way.I am normally 170 in weight (I'm 5'7) and i have an average athletic build. At the end of my pregnancy I weighed 206 so I got the 4XL size (who came up with these sizes anyway!?!?) and they fit perfectly. Attached end of preggo pic and a recent pic for body comparison if you're on the fence on what size to get or if you think it will fit you. Would definitely recommend this!!!

  Flexible fabric, all one size. These are the only band-aids I ever need and they seem to be impossible to find in stores in my area.I really like that the fabric allows for good air flow and evaporation...so even if you get them wet, they don't end up trapping a lot of water against your skin. And they stay on forever! If you're able to put them somewhere (like around a finger) where you can overlap one end over the other...they almost never come off!

  Sometimes Amazon's Choice isn't really what you would like, so just be aware and careful.  These are 3/4"" and what I had wanted was 1"" but I still purchased these because I didn't want a variety of sized that I would never use.  I like how they stick so easily even on knuckles and places that bend.  Although they are only meant to stay on for 24 hours, I have kept them on for longer, but 24 hours is really all that they should stay on.  Overall nice, but next time I will look for the one inch ones.

  Amazon shipped the Band-Aids and another brand All Health, in a pouch, and of course everything got smashed. One Band-Aid's sleeve was opened and compromised. If you can order a few other things with the bandages in your next order, so that Amazon ships everything in a box, then it maybe worth while to buy bandages from Amazon. (But then again the bandages can still get smashed.)

  Pros:__________• It’s very comfortable. When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn’t bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.• The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.• I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.• The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.• The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).• Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you’re able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.• I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.• The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you “actually” have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it’s within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.• The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn’t new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You’ll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.• Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It’s hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit’s friendly visual graphs, you don’t have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.• Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.• One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I’m a huge fan of this because you’re not wearing the watch every second of your life. It’s nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.• Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don’t use Uber, but it’s good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.• Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It’s also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.• Yes, you can swim with it. Haven’t tested this out though.• Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I’m using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________• There is a connectivity issue that I’m dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it’s doing this  but I’ve noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.• Another issue with the connectivity is you won’t know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.• On the display, I felt Fitbit’s main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don’t use this device often you’re going to be lost in there OS.• You’re paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly “Premium” services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don’t want to pay a monthly payment then you’re stuck with the “basic” software of the watch.• No idea why Fitbit did this but you can’t stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can’t even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.• Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you’ll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa’s answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.• To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon’s Alexa’s app on the phone and have an account with it.• No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.• No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn’t find it to be that much off, but it’s enough that I think you should know.• Has some thick bezels around the screen.• If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.• I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it’s a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.• Currently I can’t respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.• I notice that Fitbit doesn’t have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you’re going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn’t an issue but it’s something to note in the long run due to security reasons.• You can’t even store your favorite apps for quick access.• Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.• When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you’re going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you’re not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.• Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It’s not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It’s a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you’re only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it’s one of the few devices that can visually show you that you’re improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it’s not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn’t. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium “monthly” services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn’t useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn’t in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you’re looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn’t.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

  The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.

   Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it’s 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I’ll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can’t believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It’s supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I’ll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won’t make the same mistake.

  These Gatorade bottles are terrible. The invention of the screw cap has been around for quite some time, so I’m pretty confused how Gatorade has managed to screw it up. You have a better chance at curing world hunger than getting these lids to screw on without leaking. When I was a kid, gatorade bottles were all anyone had. Now they are so cheap and poorly plastic. Next time you see someone using a Gatorade bottle, go over and give them a hug. That person most likely needs one after dealing with these stupid lids. The struggle is real, my friends. They. Are. Terrible.

   The lids of these water bottles are horrible and do not seat on the bottle well at all. When the bottle is squeezed, the bottle deforms enough for the seal between the bottle and lid to open which causes drink to spill out, as shown clearly in the video. I was hoping these would be better than the Straight Wall Gatorade Squeeze Bottles I've had, but these are so much worse. Skip these Easy Grip bottles and instead buy the Straight Wall bottles. I have owned several of the straight wall bottles over several years and they have never leaked like these Easy Grip bottles have from Day 1.I purchased two and both show this exact same flaw and it is widely reported in the comments, which shows this is a design defect and not just a 1-off problem with my bottles.

  I read a lot of these reviews and there was several that said they leak however, I got two of them and as long as you put the lids on straight they do not leak what-so-ever!  My teenage sons wanted these for water and to use at school for gym class.  I also ordered a Gatorade GX personalized cup with pods off the website but it was 25$.  I haven't got it yet to compare the quality.  With that said these seem to be nice bottle especially for the price.  They are 32 oz. so they hold a lot of water or whatever you want in there.  There is clear strip on the side that can be used to check how much you have in there or have left.  Useful for anyone trying to increase the amount of water they intake daily or those that like to keep track.  So far so good, I'll update should any problems ever arise.  These are also dishwasher safe on the top rack if you use a dishwasher, I prefer hand washing as I think it gets dishes cleaner especially bottles like this.

  Lids leaked. I believe its a manufactturing issue. I contacted the seller, within a few hours they responed. Impressive!!! I was instructed to file a refund. However, they are checking to see if they can get 2 lids for me. The bottles were fine, just leaking lids. Im waiting to hear back from the company before I return the product.  Otherwise, I love these bottles. They do sweat, you can't avoid that. Rating was on the product not the seller, so far Im impressed with the seller.

  Solid water bottles.  I use them regularly for exercising and just life in general.  Very convenient for hydrating while working out or quickly without having to remove a lid or anything.They do have some design issues where depending on how you hold it and squeeze it, water will leak out from the lid which can be very annoying and get your shirt wet.  It seems like it varies depending on the water bottle itself.  Hit or miss.  I have also had small holes/cracks form where you squeeze the bottles after having them for a while.  Presumably do to the plastic breaking after such long use.  Additionally, you have to be aware when flying with these that the change in air pressure will affect them and cause them to spray water/leak.  I usually try to loosen the lid after take off so the pressure can equalize.Overall, I would recommend these water bottles.

  I carry a water bottle with me at all times and have tried most major brands - Camelback, Nalgene, etc…  The Gatorade Squeeze bottles are by far my favorite.  I own 8 of them and have never had one leak or malfunction in over a year - that is why I just bought 2 more.  Since there is no cap to open you don't have to put your dirty hands all over the top of the bottle to open it.  Not saying everyone's hands are dirty but you get what I am saying.A lot of reviews have said they have a problem with black mold forming inside the cap and it can't be cleaned off.  If you are putting any type of sports drink (say Gatorade…) in the bottle then it needs to be washed like any other bottle or cup you drink from.  Sugar and other additives in sports drinks can form mold.  Common sense.  I ONLY use these for purified water and I have never had a problem with mold.  I reccomend keeping the ones used only as water bottles separate from the ones you put other beverages in.These bottles can't be beat and given the price if you lose one you aren't out a lot of money like other high end water bottles

  Do not buy! The new design of these bottles leaks to the point it's unusable. I have the older version that doesn't have contoured sides. It worked great for years. These new designs have less threading on the lid and the bottle. So it is quicker to get the lid off which perhaps they saw as a benefit to trainers that need to undo dozens of these at a time but less threading makes the bottle too weak. So after about 3 times using it, the pressure is too much for the lid and it starts to leak out of the seams between the lid and bottle. I'm returning mine for a refund. May try to find the older version of the bottle.

  I have had these bottles for about 2 weeks and use them daily. They hold a lot of water, are easy to drink from, and easy to clean and care for. There's a clear strip along the side so you can keep any eye on how full the bottle is. You can also put your finger over the mouthpiece to prevent leaking if you want to shake up your drink without making a mess.Overall I'm happy with these bottles and think they are a good value for the cost.

  This is a review on the product for what it's intended for regarding tennis not a dog toy... I decided to give these a try since making the switch to pressureless tennis balls, unfortunately I have to leave these a negative review.  The balls didn't have enough bounce and all the bounce between the balls was different from each other there by making the experience very frustrating and unprofessional, also quality of felt was terrible and came off almost instantly after a few hours of play... Worst  pressureless balls I ever played with.  I'll stick with the PENN pressureless balls, they seem to be the best in my opinion..

  My dog is a fetch/ball maniac and would go through normal tennis balls over the course of a couple of weeks.  Not from malicious chewing, but just wear and tear from fetching and carrying.  I bought this bag over two years ago and still have about 8 left, I may have lost a few in the woods, but these last way longer than expected.  No cracking or ripping and cleaning with water keeps them hi-viz green.

  If you work around 3,000 lb Elephant Seals on a beach you'd know two things, 1- they are very dangerous, and 2- they are federally protected. If you hurt a seal there is problems ahead. Our solution to self preservation of the human species is a couple of tennis balls handy to bounce off the nose of an offending creature when they get too close. That turns them around.My other use is to run-off the noisy screaming Ringneck Doves that sit on our roof and scream for hours. When patience runs out, it's time to act and tennis balls won't damage the shingle or windows, plus no dead bodies to rot away up there. Not to mention the dog thinks it's a game and chases the balls when they bounce back. Although the dog can 'skin' a tennis style ball made for dogs, she can't peel off the cover on one of these. Perfect.They are probably good for tennis too.

  I bought these for my German shepherd because they were cheap and she goes through tennis balls like it's her job. Now it might say it in the product description and I wasn't paying enough attention to notice, but these are a little bit smaller than a normal-sized tennis ball. We use a Chuck-It for her, and they do fit in that, but not as solidly as a regular-sized tennis ball, so they don't go as far, but for the price, I'm not complaining.

  These are very nice balls and I am sure they would hold up in a tennis match but they are no MATCH (pun intended) for my dog. I needed them for the IFETCH ball thrower but they last about 2 days for each ball and my dog has them completely chewed up. She is such a poor sport. She loses a match and she eats the balls. Isnt there a rule against that? Oh well time to buy 18 more of them! 5 stars for holding up for 2 days at leastUpdate: My dog can crush these now within 5 min. of playing with them. She is a 30lb mini Aussie. I think the rubber is really old because after she ""breaks"" them I inspect them and the rubber crumbles. As in, I can break pieces off. Junk Dont buy.

  I read a lot of recent reviews mentioning foul odors and missing balls.  The company must have solved those problems; my bag of tennis balls had 18 regular sized tennis balls, ordinary color and average new odor.

  Fantastic. I was getting a lot of pain around my mid-back and I was told that my back muscles were very tense. I read up on foam rollers and the wonders they work so I decided to give this one a shot, since it was highly recommended on a separate website due to its durability and very low price. I went with the 36"" roller, as most guides recommended longer rollers for those who are just beginning to use them. I followed some guides on the proper use and on my first use, it hurt like crazy. I had to grit my teeth and swear a lot, but once I rolled off, I noticed my entire back felt limber, if slightly numb. The best part was that the pain was gone, and it seems for the long run. I can sit in my office chair without getting that lingering pain. I use it almost daily now, and it doesn't hurt to use it anymore. Turns out my muscles were knotted up and they were tensing up all the time on their own, and this worked out all the issues. I've started using more techniques to isolate specific muscles and it feels great. I would recommend to anyone that's looking to loosen up their muscles, particularly if they're always tense.

  Unfortunately this roller has raised seams in both sides of the roller that you can feel as you roll. It's not smooth. The material also feels like a styrofoam cooler. You can feel the little blue dots with your hand. I'm not sure how the roller would hold up in the end. I bought it as a gift and wished I had checked it out before giving it. I just assumed by the price and reviews that this was a good product. We have experience with several other rollers to compare this to. On the up side - it looks cool.

  Great foam roller. I was debating which size to get because I wanted a foam roller large enough to use on my entire body but wanted to pay as little as possible. I decided to go with the 18 inch roller and it was perfect. It's large enough to cover big areas such as your back and thighs, but small enough to easily store it in a closet or under your bed when not using it.

  It arrived in just 2 days although I didn't have Amazon Prime.I like the blue speckled color. It had raised seam on one side as some people noted in the reviews. But I was prepared and just chopped the raised foam pieces with my nail clipper. It was an easy fix, and the seam became flat & smooth in 5 minutesI chose the size very carefully - I'm 5'3'' and didn't need the roller to be too big but made sure that it was long enough for the effective hamstring & quadriceps stretch exercise. Most of the yoga mat is 24"" wide, so I knew that a 24"" roller would be a little too long when you do the stretch on the mat. A 12"" roller would be a little too small for my big thigh and if I wanted to put both thighs and legs on it at the same time. The 18"" was the perfect length as I had expected. It is, however, not long enough if you want to use it as a yoga bolster and place it vertically under your back.I tried the thigh stretch with this foam roller, and it was very firm and pressing the right muscles. I also rolled it under my back from thoracic to lower back areas, and it felt SO GOOD. The roller is also useful to get my back ready in the position to do a bridge and to safely come down from the bridge by landing my upper back on it.This $16 foam roller was a great purchase and nice addition to my home exercise tools.

  My chiropractor recommended I buy the 36"" version of this for some daily routine back stretching to do at home.  This product has been amazing for stretching, and massaging sore muscles throughout my back and shoulders.  I feel very supported by this roller and have had no issues with it thus far.  I'm not sure what kind of things people are doing to break and chip away at this thing.  I Weigh 200 pounds and have yet to damage this roller after weeks of use.  I guess don't use it as a replacement for your 9-iron, and it should hold up very well. Overall very pleased with this product. And at such a great price, I honestly can't find a single negative remark to note about it.-Great for relieving sore muscles-Very durable-Easily supports a 200lb person for exercising-Inexpensive, but very high-qualityWould highly recommend this to anyone looking to exercise and relieve soreness of muscles.

   I have been stressing my wrist and experienced discomfort with certain movements. I contribute this ongoing discomfort to the fact that I don’t think about my wrist as I’m putting strain on it. This devise put’s pressure on my wrist, thus serves as a constant reminder to be careful. While the pressure is light and bearable this wrist support helps me avoid certain movements that caused the damage to begin with and accelerates the healing process.I have tried other support systems but find them intruding into my work routine to an extend where I just take it off. I can comfortably wear this support all day, especially when I am working.Pros:- Very affordable- Fast shipping- Easy to put on with one hand- Small enoughCons- Will not last forever- Velcro release is not easy- Light protection onlyI would recommend this product to fellow shoppers, if you experience light wrist discomfort with certain movements.

  This is a really good wrist support for use during the day. I've suffered from episodes of bursitis for several years now that will last a few weeks each time.At first I made the common mistake of assuming ""bigger is better"" and wearing a heavy rigid brace with steel inserts during the day.I learned though that doing that isn't a good idea, it gets in the way of everything and it's not good to have your wrist imobilized all day and nightI definitely do recommend getting a night brace, but get something like this for during the day.You can quickly tell that whoever made this support really thought about it. It's very minimalist, which makes it light and comfortable, I've worn it every day for weeks before and it never gets annoying.The fabric is very good quality, it's very durable and flexible, and stays relatively clean and dry.My only real complaint is the size. I'd usually wear XL or 2X gloves, but this is ""one size fits all"". It certainly does fit, but it would fit better if it were larger. It starts to slip off sometimes and a couple times a day I have to adjust it.For an average person I doubt that would be an issue though. In my ideal world they should make an S-M and an M-XL version

However, I will say within its construction, there is a small Velcro patch stitched within the strap to help keep the strap in place when putting it on. And the main Velcro is very durable too. Not sure about the copper; don’t know where it is located or what it does. After wearing the strap for a few hours, it leaves a strong pungent smell both within the strap & on my wrist. I’ve worn the wrap daily for about 1 month & the fibers of the wrap are beginning to fray due to the putting on & off the Velcro. Also the material is beginning to tear between the thumb & index finger area. Had hoped it would have lasted much longer. Am grateful for the product as it has provided some support as I work in a factory setting lifting & sorting many wood products.

  I would of given this a 5 star review; however, there is one circle of velcro-sih stuff on the inside that is irritating my skin a little. This circle is there to help fasten everything on the right side of your wrist, under your pinky... but my wrist is not small enough for it to help and it rubs against my skin instead of the fabric. My wrist measures 6 1/2 inches around, it's not a big wrist at all. I can tighten everything and make the circle touch the fabric and not my skin, but it ends up being too tight and bothers me after a while. This obviously helps fasten and secure everything for people with tiny wrists, so if you are reading this and have a wrist smaller than mine than this thing is great for you. Other than this little irritating circle, I like this product. It does the job, it is comfortable (besides the little circle thing), it's very well made and not cheap, and it's even washable. If it wasn't for the little circle I would not even know I had it on. I can live with the irritating circle, it's not like it's causing a skin rash or anything major enough for me to return it, I can deal with it. This thing is helping my wrist out tremendously (carpel tunnel) and the benefits far outweigh the minor irritation.

  Excellent wrist guard...I am recovering from a broken wrist and this really helps give my wrist strength and confidence!  I use it for cross country skiing, and it even enables me to do some yoga without as much weakness and discomfort.  Highly recommend it (and I bought a less expensive but similar one which was not as comfortable, so I returned that one.)  Pay the extra money and get this one.

  I'm the least flexible person in the world. And, all my muscles are constantly clenched because I sleep knotted up in a ball and keep all of my stress stored safely in my muscles. I could pop a hamstring just standing up straight.BUT - this thing is amazing for stretching, especially if you are not naturally stretchy. Sometimes I just lie on the floor of my living room and stretch while watching TV. The book that comes with it is also really helpful and with vaguely late-80s photographs that sometimes take my mind off of the muscle spasms.I hate exercise but stretching with this strap saves me from crumbling to the ground in a pile of snapped tendons. It also helps in yoga, another workout I like based on the amount of lying down.

  I was in physical therapy for severe spinal issues (5 level spinal fusion with metal plates + an new compression fracture in my fusion.)  I practiced my ""back exercises"" for the last 37 years which helped tremendously while I was young.  Now that I've hit 60's, my back pain and issues are severe.  While in PT, the therapist had me use this stretch using it very conservative at first. I had absolutely no ability to use this at first. But under his gentle direction, gradually was able to stretch more using this while lying on my back and my other knee bent.  The stretch strap has helped tremendously.  I do use it religiously every single day.

  I ordered one of these back in 2013 on the advice of my chiropractor.  I  LOVED it!  I traveled a lot and could take this anywhere.  However, in one of my many moves, I lost my booklet.  There were always a few exercises I knew and always did but wanted to see what else I could do now that I am retired.  Wrote the company and immediately got an answer back from Ed that he would send me the booklet.  Holy Cow Batman...I was amazed at the fast response but more amazed that he did not charge me and sent it almost as fast as his email reply.  Great piece of equipment and even greater customer service!  Mucho thanks Ed!!!

  Shocking but amazing results from doing simple stretches. Saw this strap demonstrated on YouTube. Bob and Brad physical therapists recommended for different things. I wrenched my knee twice, a few days apart. I've used the strap to stretch and strengthen the supports to my knee. I was sceptical but it really made a difference for me. Ice packs and ibuprofen and this strap got me through the rough spots. When i don't use it, the pain comes back. My knee is healing nicely. I'll continue to use it because it's good therapy for anyone. I'm in my 60's. Highly satisfied.

  Embarrassingly, I am in physical therapy for the ironic overuse of my gluteus medius and minimus muscles, otherwise known as the ""forgotten butt muscle."" Definitely too much TMI, but part of that therapy focuses on stretching and strengthening the hip flexors, the back and hamstrings.  If you've ever tried to stretch your hamstrings on your own, this is close to impossible to do well - until this nifty device.I was introduced to this Stretch Out Strap (the acronym SOS is not lost on me in my current hobbled state) during physical therapy as a way to perform a variety of stretches on my own at home and without a partner.  Pure genius.  There is nothing to adjust - there are foot loopholes sewn into the nylon, so you simply put your foot in the loop that works for you.This strap also comes with a book of various stretches - some of which look way too elaborate - so I am sticking with the simple hamstring stretch and a few other simpler hip stretches until I get better at using the strap.  For the price (approximately $15), I am using it quite a bit for stretches I couldn't do before on my own.Although my ""issue"" hasn't resolved, I am at least sure that I am getting in the best stretching I can during my home exercise program with teh use of this band.

The OPTP strap is a thick nylon strap of high quality and the straps we received appeared to be made of cotton with a slightly different design.

  I started doing yoga and pilates maybe 4-5 times per week about six months ago, and I’ve seen such a dynamic change in the way that my body both works and feels, that I’ve become a bit of an addict when it comes to the lifestyle. One of the girls I met in my vinyasa class recommended getting a strap to stretch out my body in different ways (as flexibility is my main weakness) and I started the hunt for one that would give results. I initially planned on getting one from a yoga goods company, but I started seeing information throughout my search on straps meant for restorative therapy, and opted to give that a look. I found this particular one on a fitness blog, and opted to give it a try a) because the price was right b) all of the reviews specifically mentioned the term “range of motion” and c) because those loops looked like they would be great to play around with. I got the strap and started giving it a try, and while I initially had no clue as to what I was doing, I eventually got the hang of it and started using it on almost a daily basis. On days when I was feeling particularly sore from class, I would rub on a little of my tea tree based pain reliever,

  I created this balloon install for my friends daughters grad party and this product was a life saver. Really. I would have died trying to blow up all these balloons. This machine takes a bit of finesse but once you get the hang of it it is smooth sailing. Has troubles w the smaller balloons and the long balloons. The trick is to hold the balloon on the nozzle and stretch the balloon until the latex is thin enough for the machine to push the air in. It also helps to stretch the balloon a few times to loosen the latex. Over all I am happy with this machine.The air does blow out a little hot. So don't try to hold your finger over the holes. I can assume the heat is what helps the latex to expand.

  I thought this product would be too much for the small party decorating we had in mind or that it would be a piece of junk that failed after the 3rd balloon.  But the pump was easy to use and lightweight but up to the task of filling 50 balloons without difficulty. We plan on using it for our next party!

  I really like this. It made blowing up balloons soooo much easier. The materials to make a balloon Garland were very helpful as well. I just wish it was more quiet...dont expect to hide in another room doing balloons lol! It is loud! It can also get fairly hot, so be careful around little kids. Lastly, the stickers to stick the balloons together dont work, so I just used tape instead. I also saw this at party city for 40.00 so the price is awesome! I would buy it again for this price and would recommend itPlease click helpful if this was helpful

  I made a balloon arch for the first time ever and could NOT have done it without this! I love the different nozzle sizes, and that you can just push the nozzle down to make the air flow as you need it instead of having it run the whole time. Highly recommend!!For the extras, I didn't think I would use the balloon knotter, but my fingers got sore halfway through and it did help a lot. The wall hooks didn't support the weight of our arch, so we ended up using 3m velcro hooks with the fishing line. I didn't end up needing the glue dots.

I blew up 100 balloons and assembled my balloon arch/garland in less than 2hours I’d say depends on your energy level, it took me about 1.5 hours give or take.

  This balloon pump iis awesome.  Something you can use again and again.  Made blowing up the balloons so easy and a little fun.  I can't imagine blowing them up by mouth to make an arch.  Worth the price for a lot of balloons.  The products inside were worth it too to make your balloon arrangement.

  This has helped me reach my goal of being able to do a pull up. I have had this for 6 months now and am satisfied with the results I have gotten with my workouts. This comes in different resistance levels differentiated by color. I started doing assisted pullups with the green band, which has the strongest resistance, and have now transitioned to pullups with no assist. It definitely helps get you started and makes you feel accomplished to be able to do the exercise. I also use it for banded good mornings, which also works well for it.

  So far we have only used the red and black bands for stretching and resistance.  I guess we aren't strong enough or imaginative enough for the others yet but we'll get there.  They are latex material.  This is a high quality set of bands and will work for anyone needing a little extra help stretching out those sore achy muscles after a workout and stiff ones for before the workout.  You can also use them to build upon the strength you have and as a portable gym on the go. We use them to stretch out before deadlifts and squats.  Also to help strengthen those knees and hips.

  These bands are phenomenal. I'm 6'1"" and I was leary how far I could stretch these from the bottom of my feet to the tops of my hands overhead, silly I know, but in my mind I envisioned them snapping and popping me in the face, haha.  No risks of that happening.  They are mobile, they work muscle areas that weights simply can not reach and they overall make you stronger with a followed routine.  There are copious amounts of youtube videos for lessons and routines to follow. Love them!

  Well, the red band finally snapped after 2 years of moderate use.  It was good while it lasted, especially considering the price.  But I was surprised it frayed when it didn't really rub against anything abrasive (like the floor).  The bands are good to use and has its place in between weights and cardio.  It's definitely good for travel.  Overall, I like the bands and would recommend them as a supplemental use.Update: It looks like 2 years is the breaking point (literally), because today the purple band snapped.  When I inspected the second purple band, that one has frayed also, so I don't think I'll be using it any longer.  It appears to be have dried out.So once again, good product considering what it costs, but don't expect it to last too long.

The instruction and exercise manual is lacking, but I hope that's not your reason for seeking out the resistance bands. I also recently noticed that my gym has the same brand of resistance bands, so I feel more confident in my purchase after seeing dozens of folks use them without incident. These are also way cheaper than anything I could buy in person.

1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,2.0,"
  This is the first time I have ever written a review of a purchased product, but I was so dismayed by this, I had to write something.  I bought this as a gift for Christmas for my kids.  I was a bit shocked at the price of this product when I saw it on Amazon, but I figured it would be worth it.  Wrong!  As this was to be his ""Santa"" gift, I felt so sheepish when my son pulled it out of the box.  It is made of the cheapest grade plastic you can imagine.  The netting is just some basic, flimsy net that you have to keep pulling on to get it to be tight enough to actually bounce the ball.  The balls are what you might find at the dollar store.  I spent Christmas morning, and every time I see it in my son's room, thinking about how it is probably the invention of some frat bro who realized he could make millions putting this thing into people's homes by having it cost him about $3.50 per set to manufacture, and selling it for $60.  I am certain he has achieved that goal.  There is nothing about this that says quality or built to last.  I suppose, in the plus column, one could say that it is easily transportable for a spontaneous SpikeBall tournament on the beach, or that you aren't going to worry too much about it breaking, except that you wasted $60 on it.  Disappointed to say the least.

1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,2.0,"
  Very overpriced for what you get. Rim is flimsy and distorts when net tightened enough to make balls bounce properly. Biggest disappointment was that net tore after only a few days of playing. Now what?
"
1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,1.0,"
  Extremely impractical, cannot enjoy. The videos about how fun it is are extremely misleading. Once you actually try it, you suddenly see that the net is not stable, i.e. moves around when hit by a ball, and not really bouncy, despite being pulled on the rim very tightly, not bouncy enough even with balls pumped well. What is really bad is the concept, since the active part of the net is much smaller than the size of the rim - the ball does not bounce well when hitting close to the rim, even if it does not hit the rim itself, and so, need to hit the small area in the very center of the net if want the hit to not be affected by the rim. It was a gift to our boys, so, I hesitated to return it, hoping they would like it anyway, but by the time it is clear they cannot make any sense of it it is also too late to return ... I don't know what kind of genius marketed this thing, really smart, since it does look appealing until you actually try playing, and its production cost must be much smaller than the price, since the whole thing is really cheaply made - the rim is an easily bent plastic tube, the balls are very primitive too.
"
1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,1.0,"
  This is a fun game however the net sucks. I would not recommend spending the money on this. Especially since we are always re-stretching out the net and it just does not have enough bounce to it. We seriously have had more fun with a small exercise tramp and racquetballs and get a better result. Just my opinion maybe we are playing it wrong and don't really understand the game but I think if it had a better net or bouncing system it would be awesome and more worth the money. This is really cheap in my opinion. Sorry and Thanks

  We are HOOOKED on Spikeball!Me and my buddies (all 24-25) went out to Wisconsin for weekend of camping and brought this along. We nearly played all day! It was so fun to learn the rules and get better at this game. If you give it a try and put some effort into it, the learning curve is quick. After a couple hours, we were all running around the circle like pros.I would reccomend watching a video or two before playing just so you can understand how the flow of the game goes. Either way, just remember, its essentially Volleyball, but instead of the ball going over the net, once it HITS the net the other team takes service.Have fun! They also sell glow in the dark balls so you can play at night!

  I have never tried any other brace. But I am a new mom and have De Quervains Tenosynovitis from and needed to demobilize my tendon on my thumb.  This works pretty well. I LIVE in this brace. I only take it off to shower.It works pretty well for my condition, however it does not completely stop my tendon from moving.  Since I can not completely give my hands rest (i have a baby.. there is no getting around using my hands)  So sometimes when using my hand, it gets tweaked and OMG, the pain is horrible.I showed my doctor this brace and she said it should be stiffer and recommended a medical grade one.I am still going to use this one for now as it is a lot softer then the medical ones and I dont want to hurt the baby and its easier to sleep in it.I probably would recommend this brace if you could actually give your injury true rest. But so far, ive been wearing it for 5 weeks and my injury has not healed at all.

  It works for immobilizing the thumb if you don't plan to use the affected hand at all. There's a double stitch right at the crack of the thumb that creates so much pressure with the sharp stitches I can't decide what pain is worse, the pain from the injury or the pain from the brace. Re-injured myself while wearing it today, I even added an ace bandage under it to help stabilize and keep it from destroying my thumb crotch, no dice. Don't waste the money if you're active at all.

  I have carpal tunnel on my left wrist and trigger finger on both my thumbs.  I got an Aircast wrist wrap/thumb stabilizer through my insurance company on the recommendation of my chiropractor. I also got a thumb splint for the other thumb. Both of these could onlly be worn at night because it's impossible to use your hands with either of them on. Middle of the night potty breaks were a real pain and very loud and hard as I peeled off my thumb splint to free my hand. I wanted something that was easier to use and that I could use all the time of I wanted to. I decided to try these. I was hesitant as there was only one review, but they looked like they would work well for me.I couldn't be happier! I have medium size hands and the fit is perfect. The thumb support keeps me from bending my thumb, but the tip is exposed enough that I can use it as normal. That's huge for me!  My wrist is stabilized perfectly as well. I was so pleased with it that I just ordered another one to wear on my other thumb at night.

  After having my first baby I developed ""mommy's thumb"". It's a real thing. My thumb and wrist hurt SO bad from holding my baby's head and the strain it was putting on my thumb. It became super painful and numb. I did some research and saw that other mom's bought something like this and decided to give it a try. Definitely helped keep my thumb stable and supported. I could still do things with this on and the pain went away completely in a couple weeks.

  I bought this brace a year ago for two problems.  Carpal tunnel and a really arthritic thumb (basal thumb arthritis.)  It's helped my hand so much!  If I forget to wear it and fall asleep really hard I wake up with a numb hand from bending at the wrist, which the brace prevents you from doing.  It also keeps my thumb somewhat immobile, so that I don't damage it by (unconsciously) squeezing my fist at night while asleep.  It's been a year, and I'm finally thinking it needs washing, so I looked at the packaging which instructs me to hand wash and line dry it.  I noticed it says it has anti-bacterial (""aegis"") shielding which must be what kept it from getting funky until this much time went by, which is amazing because my hands sweat quite a bit.  This product is so much better than the wrist braces that my insurance would cover (after hassling with getting a script for one from a doctor,) and for under 15 bucks it's a great value.  The velcro on the thumb is threatening to wear out, so I'm ordering a second one for back up, because I wouldn't want to ever be without this brace, and for the money it's worth it to have a second one even if I just misplace the original.  I don't find the velcro wearing out to be a negative because of all positive aspects of this brace, it's fairly cool and comfortable, it's got antimicrobial shielding, and it protects my hand from becoming a total mess when I'm asleep.  At my worst, before I had this brace, my hands were such a mess that just pulling my socks up would be very difficult and painful.  If I wanted to be really cheap, I think it would be possible to sew on new velcro.

  This would be a great brace, but there is a seam, that is heavily stitched, that sits right in the crook of your thumb and forefinger. It stabs in that spot. I tried on both my right and left hand and it did it either way. In 1/2 hour of wearing I had red, raw skin there. I had my husband try it before writing this review to see if it was just my hands. It was not. It was doing the same thing to him. Maybe it isn't always stitched there? I can't explain why there are so many positive reviews as this is unwearable for me.

  I purchased this because I had a synovial cyst removed and sometimes get pain in the wrist from my thumb moving. Overall for the price it is pretty decent. It is a little big for me. I am a petite female, so that doesn't surprise me. I wish the thumb portion was a bit stiffer. I wear this at night and notice that I can still move my thumb quite a bit. I also wish the material that goes around the top of my hand was tighter. It is very loose and while it is not uncomfortable, it might be a problem if I was wearing the brace during the day. It is super easy to change from R to L hand, you don't even have to move any straps. It is also easy to put on and off. It isn't too long/high on my wrist and hand, which was something I was looking for as my last one went halfway down my arm. It is non-irritating to wear and the material inside is soft, but it seems like it is sturdy enough to last a while. I give it only three stars because I wish it had more thumb stability.

  I bought these shorts not for exercising, but actually for the sole purpose to wear under dresses to help keep the dreaded chub rub at bay (you ladies with thick thighs know what I mean!!). To that end, they did their job! The shorts are soft and very stretchy, and as an added bonus they helped keep my belly under wraps as well as protect my thick thighs from chafing under the dress. You can’t tell I was wearing anything underneath. The size chart was right on point, I am 5’4” and weigh about 200lbs, so I bought the XL and they fit perfect.

  These shorts are going to be part of my Summer 2018 anthem. I wore them for the first time during a 10K race (took a chance) and they served me well. The high waist keeps my tummy in place. The 8"" inseam is a comfortable length on my thighs - not too short or long. The legs didn't ride up either. The pockets were perfect for my big phone - a Samsung J7. Not once did my phone pop out. Perfect thickness of fabric - passed the squat test (not see-through when squatting). Several of my runner friends were interested in them for themselves. I immediately bought another pair in navy. I imagine I'll purchase a few more pairs as I train for my marathon.Update: I will officially be wearing these shorts for the Chicago Marathon. I've worn them all summer and they have held up every step of the way.

  I’m 5’10 and about 205 pounds carrying most of my weight in my tummy. I purchased and xxl based off of size chart.  I love that the waist goes above my belly button and holds in all of my muffin top and belly bulge.  Even when I am going on light jogs it stays up!!!! I almost never find myself adjusting and pulling them back up.  I use these several times a week during my workouts or when I’m deep cleaning. They are very comfortable.  Never left with a red mark around my waist. They are stretchy yet form fitting.  I will be purchasing more since I love the longer length (no chub rub with this length), non shiny fabric and the high waist (above be belly button).  However, I do get the tiny fabric balls on inner thigh area after a few times wearing them so I’m only giving them 3 stars. They start to shabby after several uses so while great for working out I wouldn’t wear these out and about in public unless brand new.

  Had already bought the Baleaf capris with the phone pocket and wanted to try the shorts.  Can't believe how many manufacturers are ignoring active women who need a spot for their phones!  So happy to discover Baleaf.  The pocket fit my iPhone 7 in its case and held it firmly against my upper outer thigh so there wasn't bouncing around and I didn't get chaffed. There was also a hidden pocket at the waist that could actually hold a key with fob, not just a single key.  Again, HOORAY and why don't more makers of activewear think of this?  How many people just run out the door with NOTHING when they go run, walk or bike?  I am 5'6"" and wear a size 8 comfortably and the medium fit the way I wanted.  It felt supportive and snug but nothing was tight.  I am a runner and appreciate that the legs of the shorts didn't ride up as I ran. Fabric was a good thickness, not at all see through.  I am a fan!

  I was looking for a bench that could handle the weight of a big guy and still fold up for compact storage. The FlyBird looks like it's going to do the job. I just took it out of the box today. Assembly took about three minutes because it only involved screwing on the foot pads.The bench initially wobbled on the flat floor but that was fixed as soon as I inserted the frame pin. I was very cautious to detect any instability because I am 6'2"" and 270 pounds. No squeaks or wobbles so far.The bench was due on Monday but showed up early on the preceding Friday. It was shipped via slow-boat UPS ground from CA to me in VA. The package arrived in good condition and packaged effectively. There wasn't a lot of trash to dispose of.Overall I am happy with this purchase. The price was good. The product seems to be good quality. I just hope that it lasts a while.

  This bench is great...good quality, sturdy, smooth operation and folds up nicely for easy storage. My only gripe is that it is just too tall.  Most weight benches are around 17-18"" high off the ground; this one is 21 inches.  May not seem like a lot but it makes for a feeling of instability when planting your feet on the floor or while lowering dumbbells.  If you don't mind resting your feet on the foot rests while exercising for stability then it's fine. Unfortunately the height was a deal breaker for me and I had to return it, which was a shame as I loved all the other factors of it.  For reference I am 6 feet tall. Also I've included two pictures of this bench and the one I ultimately ended up going with to give some perspective on the height.  The other bench in the picture is 17.5"" tall.

  Was looking for an adjustable bench for my home gym, and decided on this one - based on its features, favorable customer reviews and for a good price.  So far, i'm happy with the purchase.  Out of the box it was super easy to assemble. It's lightweight - light enough for my wife or son to move/re-position if needed, but sturdy and comfortable.  I've read some comments from 'bigger' guys - a lightweight bench probably isn't ideal for big guys.  I'm 5'9"", 170 lbs and have no issues.  One of the features i like most about the bench is the range of available adjustments. I was especially interested in the decline options.  Overall, this bench has been a great buy for me.

  Love how compact it is, can put it in a coat closet or really anywhere, I put mine in me garage in between the bikes that hang on the wall, look at the picture, you can barely find it. Light too. My only issue is that I am 5-11” and find that I want it to be slightly closer to the ground. It’s a little taller than most benches I have used. And I’m not sure if it’s the height and the fact that is light weight but I would be concerned if I was using a lot more weight that I might tip over. Maybe you could get some extensions for the feet to widen the base. Maybe it’s just me. Either way I still love not having to have a dedicated workout room.  The packs up so small so easily that you can take it out get your workout in anywhere in the house and put it in a closet or anywhere else when you’re done.

  This is a pretty sturdy workout bench. I've taken a picture of the various ways you can use this bench. Set up took less than 5 minutes. So far I've got no issues with it except when I do the sit up workout, my butt sticks out a bit at the end. This isn't an issue if I stick to crunches.One negative is the smell. It's got like a new bench smell that is pretty strong and doesn't go away. I've had this bench for a couple of months now and although it's mostly gone, I can still smell it a little.Overall I'm pretty happy with the bench.One note, the Styrofoam inside the box came half destroyed. Caused a huge mess in my room. If it's packed properly, this should not happen.*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.

  For as cheap as this was, I didn't expect the kind of quality I saw here.  And NO CONSTRUCTION was a total relief!  It folds up very nicely.  The only cautionary point I'd make is for anyone under 5.4' or so (although my girlfriend is 5'2"" and loves it) because this is one of their bigger benches out there.  For example, top of the cushion to the floor is about 19"", which means that most people will not be able to put their feet flat on the floor while doing say flies, but you can put your feet on the footrest.  On the upside, the bench is quite long, and it can easily support a 6.2' man for inclines.  For an all-around smaller bench that shorter folks would probably prefer, buy the ""FLYBIRD Adjustable Bench"" which is 2.5"" shorter to the top of the pad and a few inches shorter.  You'll love either one I'm sure.

  Ok. My friend came over and we were gonna play go fish and I was really excited because I had watched some youtube strategy videos and was looking forward to using my new skills (youtube is the BEST when it comes to learning new skills. Especially card games. )  I was SURE I was going to kick his ass, but I'm not gonna lie, this guy is good (I'm pretty sure he's the guy that uploaded all the skills videos, I know a pair of hands when I see them ;) but seriously. And then I was like, ""Jared, did you make a bunch of youtube videos for go fish strategy""? and HE said. ""no.""  Yeah right).  I also know a liar when I see one, kinda like my hand noticing thing.  So, he wanted to use his deck, but I just got this fresh bicycle set off of amazon so I pulled rank on that argument. I'll admit, his deck was pretty dope, a harry potter set, but I get really triggered by Dumbledore (To be clear, i don't DISLIKE Dumbledore. He's amazing. It just makes me sad because... well you know... and if you don't I don't want to spoil it, but he dies.)  So anyways, we're in the thick of it, asking for cards left and right.  I was like ""Jared, do you have any sixes?"" I was nice about it, of course.  Hostility doesn't get you far in competitions ;).  Then he said ""no"".  But I needed sixes. Bad times. But thats life. Long story short, I ended up losing that round. (I was going for sixes...i should have known). GET THIS. after, and ONLY after, jared won that round he casually mentioned to me that my deck (the red one) was missing the six of hearts. I dont even know where to start. First of all, how in the world did he know that?? He MUST be the youtube guy I just know it! I would NEVER notice - even if it was a joker missing!!  At first I thought he was pulling a Dumbledore on me.  But then I realized that it was for real, the six of hearts was missing.  I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF BOTH BIYCLE CARDS AND AMAZON FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS. Am I upset that I lost? Yes.  Am I upset that I misplaced my trust in full, complete decks of cards? Yes.  Am I upset that Dumbledore is dead?  Yes, and, spoiler alert. He's dead. I hope you did not read that part about him dying.  Especially if you are a harry potter fan and also didn't know that Dumbledore is dead. Thats why I said spoiler alert. It's so sad. I would not buy this deck of bicycle cards, especially if you plan on playing someone as talented as Jared at go fish. So anyways, you get it. three stars. But the blue pack was immaculate. Pretty much the best deck of cards ive ever laid my hands on. Three stars.RIP Dumbledore.*Spoiler alert*

  So disappointed! I grew up playing w/Bicycle brand cards for years! Always loved the quality, weight, texture and material. Our home was destroyed by toxic mold and I missed my cards so my husband splurged and specifically ordered this brand. Material is thin & feels like some type of plastic or something with a weird material with a tiny cross hatched pattern to them, I'm assuming in an attempt to make them slippery but it doesn't help. They are way more slippery than old decks, even brand new, used to be. Hard to even shuffle them. So, unfortunately, like many other companies, Bicycle has followed suit (pun intended) and opted for cheaper materials. Makes me sad, especially when much of the reason people play with""real"" cards is for the feel & texture of them in their hands. I get it, cheaper materials=making more money. Just unfortunate, especially with some where ""the feel"" matters so much. I'm disappointed Bicycle!

  Yes, I can buy this set for $1.00 less at a brick & mortar store, but that also means masking up and worrying that I don't catch COVID in the process. Speaking of COVID, we've played a lot of cards with our kids in the last 8 months and expect to play more. Thus, getting a pair of new decks was essential. We split one into a Euchre deck and the other will be for cribbage. I grew up in the Windsor, Ontario, area when the Bicycle cards were made in our area. These are the same cards I played with as a kid. Nothing has changed. They are crisp. The finish is excellent, the weight is perfect, the lettering and prints are sharp. The 13 yr old can shuffle them with ease and even the 10 yr old is able to give it a try. I wouldn't play with any other cards. 5 stars.

Just some company copying the exact design.)I ended up buying cause I felt they were a good price for two but I now understand why.

  I recently moved and had to sell my bench and squat rack due to size constraints (a 1.5-2k $ set up). I somewhat begrudgingly bought a cheap power tower and these bands. I was actually really surprised that this cheap setup allowed me to reliably do similar workouts to what I was able to do before with the added benefit of being super cheap and easy to move. It is NOT as a good as an actual gym. But it does allow you to get a decent workout on the cheap. The carabiners are not great quality and are sort of annoying to get into the fabric loops. These could be easily replaced but its not like 150lbs is going to break them anyway. It would also be nice to be able to order single additional bands. Overall I recommend these. I spent less than 300$ on these, a power tower (city birds), and a large mat and I feel like I have a decent home gym that I could easily progress on and move around.

  I'm a 280 pound, former high school lineman so I need good resistance. I prefer free weights but these Resistance Bands are GREAT for when you can't hit the free weights. These bands are very convenient since all you need is a door that shuts. Pop the included door anchor above your door or along the side with hinges and close the door, then you're ready to rock out multiple exercises. Bands offer great range and resistance. I was a little worried when I put all the bands together and started chest exercise but the bands (and thankfully the anchor AND my door) held firm.Only complaint... the black straps can rub against the body and the carabiners are a little too small for my big fingers but it's not that big of a deal.Got in a great workout without evening leaving the bedroom.If you're looking for resistance bands, these will make her dance.

  I have had this set of bands for about a week and am extremely pleased with them. I have a small area in my garage where I lift weights daily, and while I've always liked weights (dumbbells) these bands are very efficient, and effective. I get a great workout with them, and can do a large variety of resistance training exercises with these. I am 72 years old, and appreciate a great workout less the wear and tear that weights can cause. My only issue happened when the blue (20lb) band broke at both ends. This was more than likely operator error. But I contacted the seller directly, and they promised to get a replacement band in the mail asap. I would highly recommend these bands to anyone who cannot get to the gym because of Covid-19, or does not have space at home for free weights or machines.

  This is my first time buying a resistance band and it works great!I initially bought the bands because all of the dumbbells were basically sold out on Amazon and a lot of places are price gouging and I’m glad that I made the switch.The resistant bands are surprisingly please stretchy and durable. I find myself mostly using the red 50 pounds resistance band by itself.The resistant bands are surprisingly please stretchy and durable.

  If you are in the fitness industry, clearly you know all your equipments limitations (unlike the idiots who had commented on this product). This is an unbiased review- just in case. The issue is that I almost not buy these because of the comments on this. But I took the risk because I had a similar set a long time ago- I lost in a moving.With these I have been able to build muscle fatigue at the end of each workout making sure that pump stays in. I have been able to do double grip rows, donkey kicks, hip extensions and single-arm flys (hooking one end on a loop available on a sissy squat machine I have).  On weight drops I always rely on unlatching the 10’s or 20’s.#greatproducts #3months of use

1,SPORTS,YETI Bottle Straw Cap for Rambler Bottles,$12.98,5.0,"
  At $12.99 I was skeptical to buy this lower priced option but did anyway.  I'm glad I did.It works like a charm.  No leaks and usable with or without the straw.  It really makes my 36oz rambler so much more convenient.12 hours ago I added ice and water to this awesome Christmas gift.  I was curious if at room temperature the ice would last.  It did.  I'm now thinking I'll still have ice after 24 hours.I love this thing!BTW, Happy New Year!!

1,SPORTS,YETI Bottle Straw Cap for Rambler Bottles,$12.98,5.0,"
  I was a bit apprehensive about buying this as there are other more expensive options on Amazon, but this one is 100% Yeti authentic and packaged in Yeti packaging. The straw is measured on the back of the package to which size Rambler you own and cut it to size.I've found the straw connected easily, stay on the cap, and works flawlessly so far. Great pressure and a full mouthful of liquid (water used only) draws consistently. The new cap also does not leak and the angled handle is not only functional, but gives me more than enough room to drink comfortably from the device.Quite happy with this.

  I had bought a Yeti several months ago and I didn't always like having to unscrew the lid and drink from the wide mouth. I was looking for something that made drinking my water easier while also still having a handle to hold onto. I use this every single day and I love it. The only drawback is that the straws it comes with are too long and you have to trim them to fit your Yeti's size. You don't have to use the straws though and can simply tilt the water bottle.

  Had my yeti for about a year but wanted to not have to unscrew a lid every time i wanted a drink. I bought my husband a yeti for Christmas and got us both one of these lids. Very convenient, you can pop up the straw with one hand, and i love that it still has a handle too. Came with 2 straws that you have to trim, but that was an easy fix. They have a ruler on the packaging that's fairly accurate.

1,SPORTS,YETI Bottle Straw Cap for Rambler Bottles,$12.98,5.0,"
  I was looking for something to make it easier to drink my water while working out and generally eliminate the awkward squeak I get sometimes when I'm opening and closing the top in class. I found this and it works perfectly! I've been using it for about 3 months now and it works incredibly. I've wanted an alternative to my Camelbak for a while because I like the insulation (no sweating!), but I was disappointed to trade insulation for a straw. Luckily, this saved the day. It does leak sometimes if it's been overfilled, but I've learned where too much water is and that issue has gone away. I use it on my 26oz no problem. Cutting the straw to size was very easy. I really recommend this if you're looking for a straw lid for your Rambler.
"
1,SPORTS,YETI Bottle Straw Cap for Rambler Bottles,$12.98,5.0,"
  I got this for my Yeti Rambler (growler) to make it easier to drink from.  This top works well, is easy to clean and take apart for cleaning. The only downfall is that the beverage inside the rambler does get warmer faster with this top on verses the having original top installed.  So now instead of opening up the rambler a day or 2 later with ice still clinking around like it does with the original top on, the beverage is still just cool the next day (not a big deal).  So if you drink a lot or empty the rambler in one day it shouldn't make a difference to you.  If you use it as a growler for beer I wouldn't recommend storing the beer in it with this top on it for more than a day.

Is it OK to get excited over this lid ? ... Yeah it’s OK

  Purchased these as a gift for my brother who is at a different stage of life than my own. They seem to get a ton of use when he has parties/gatherings/a drunk friend over.I purchased this a year ago and waited to see how it held up before leaving the review. They’ve been stored outside in San Diego since last Christmas (2017!). They haven’t color faded in this SoCal sun which is pretty impressive.We don’t get much weather variety, so the wood has stayed in good condition. Honestly, except for a couple teeth marks from his puppy, they’ve really maintained their form.They’re perfect size, not too tiny where you’re like “wtf, I feel like I got misled and ripped off!” And they aren’t oversized where you’re like “okay, this is embarrassing and making my yard look small.” They’re also very durable and visually pleasing (for what they are).Absolutely would recommend.

  I bought these when they went on sale. I like to put things in my cart and if they go down in price, then I buy it before it goes back up. My grandson who is 5 had a great time this weekend playing this with us. Also I had him help me add up the points just to work on his math. I like to incorporate a little learning whenever I can without the stress of him feeling pressured.  It's a great game for hand and eye coordination. And teaching good sportsmanship.  We will be playing everytime he comes over for a visit. Going to look for more games that are physical and mental like this one, to play with him in his visits.

  I gave this as Christmas gift to my daughter and I was so disappointed with it. The day we got, one of the stick broke. The quality was so poor. The price i paid doesn't seems to justify the quality of product at all. We havent even started playing it and i just set it up and placed on ground that a ball roll over and broke one stick. it didnt hit it directly it just rolled over it and stick got broke. my daughter started crying a lot as her new toy broke even before she could play with it. to calm her down we just played on 4 of the remaining sticks. it does look like a fun game. thats why I am giving 2 stars to it.i wish i had a replacement stick with it. They should send 1-2 stick etc with it anyways as its quality is not that great.I have edited the rating just because this is 1st time it has happened to me that a merchant has refunded the amount based on a reviews. I didn't want the refund as I was not aware that merchant will refund the amount. As I said the game is surly fun to play with whole family.

  It was easy to put together but one of the pegs would not go in due to the hole not having groves for it to screw into so my husband had to screw it in,  After that the peg made the groves so it as easy to put together.

  This was so easy to assemble that my 6 year old granddaughter put it together. The rope rings are sturdy and work well. The plastic rings are useless. I ordered a separate set of 10 rope rings because the plastic rings were useless. Even with that, I gave this game five stars because it is fun to play for all ages, young and old.In the summer time, you can play it on your lawn or at a park. When the weather gets rainy and cold, it can be played indoors.The case that it comes with is very nice because it fits all parts compactly.

  Updated: I had recieved a defective item, but within a day of posting my review I was contacted by customer service, who very promptly sent out a replacement (arrived in two days with Sunday delivery) that works perfectly.  Thank you for the great customer service.  it is much appreciated!  If you have the slightest problem with this item, contact Elite directly ASAP.  They are super friendly and helpful. Changed to full stars.  The kids love this game!We really wanted to love this one, as my child specifically asked for a ring toss game for a birthday party.  It looks great, and the handy tote is a great selling point for it.  Plus it's the perfect size for young players.  However, after we set it up for the kids to play with I noticed that is was a little wonky, with two of the pegs sticking out at odd angles. I asked the kids to give me a minute to fix it, thinking it was a slipped thread on the rods and it would be quick and easy to unscrew and screw back together properly.  The first rod came off easily, but I couldn't really get it back on perfectly straight.  Moving on to the second rod, I quickly noticed it was jammed.  I gave it another twist, and the rod came off, but without the threaded part at the bottom. It had snapped right off.  Upon closer inspection, the holes on one plank had been mis-threaded, causing the rods to jam up when screwed together.  Had I left well enough alone, the kids would have at least gotten a day out of it, but once it broke that was it for the game.It really was a shame, as my first impression after receiving the game in the mail was that this would be perfect for our party, and figured I would just keep it handy in the trunk for other family events and such.

  I hope you can see in the photo that the 1 yr old strap (top) is about twice as thick as the new junk they sent me (bottom). Is the price half of what the originals cost since I'm getting half the material?? NO in fact I paid MORE for less! The photo doesn't do it nearly the justice of seeing and feeling them in person. No comparison from old to new, old ones were quality and new ones are trash. Needless to say these have been returned....Just as an FYI I've been using this brand of straps for YEARS! I'll never Waste another cent on anything Harbinger sells and hope this helps others save their hard earned money.When these first arrived and I took them from the packaging I thought they were counterfeit knockoffs. So I called the company direct and sent them photos via email of what I received alongside of the ""same ones"" I had bought about a year ago that clearly show the new corner cutting cheap garbage are about half the thickness. They won't last and because they're much thinner they will painfully dig into the wrist. The best part is after numerous emails and photos  ( I believed they hoped I'd let it go ) they write me back telling me the ""gloves"" are now made thinner for a better feel. That's funny since the entire time we were talking about the STRAPS and they had my photos that they claimed to have sent to their ""Product Development Team"" and came back with that bogus excuse. Needless to say I wrote them back letting them know we were talking about STRAPS not gloves and never heard back (Shocking). Save your money and buy a different a brand so you'll get what you paid for...

  Huge downgrade from the previous manufactured straps and I am very disappointed. With this downgrade of less material and or weaves, you lose comfort and durability. From further inspection it looks like they removed the edge seam as shown in the pics to cut cost. I've been purchases harbinger products since the 90s and this is the first time I've lost trust in them. I've would've gladly payed more to get back that quality from the original straps. Bring back the old quality!

  Great straps - love the padding - super soft right from the packaging. Didn't need much breaking in. Straps had me deadlifting an extra 50lbs on the first use.I'm a female, 5'2"", athletic but small wrists - fit great didn't need any alterations or cutting of fabric/padding either. Awesome right outta the box - highly recommend if you're looking for straps. Also the color is great cause it's a deep/rich pink which is recognizable and distinct but not obnoxiously girly... cause you know women care about those things ;).

  Thanks to these lifting straps, I was able to hit a new deadlift PR! I’ve always used my hand, no gloves for grip and constantly felt like I was dropping the bar because I have small hands. These straps made me feel like I had that bar and could keep it up! Omg in love with these! Strongly recommend for anyone avoiding gloves but wanting the secure hold!

  This is my first pair of lifting straps, and so far I'm happy with them. MAKE SURE TO WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS on how to use these properly. Not just Harbinger videos but some other brands as well. Make sure the ""lose"" end on both hands goes towards your thumb (which means there will be a ""left"" and a ""right"" one after you pull the strap through the loop). Also make sure to watch the video where they show you how to tighten them using the ""motorcycle grip"" (i.e. pinching and turning forward with your thumb).I purchased these for two reasons. First of all, I dislocated my finger recently, so it was hurting to lift (especially in pulling motions, like pull-ups or rows). I wanted something to help with the grip while my hand recovers. I am also finding that as my deadlifts are getting heavier, my hands/wrists are giving out before my legs do, so while I do want to develop grip strength, I simply was robbing my lefts of the extra reps I could've done were it not for the hands.I'm yet to try heavy deadlifts (waiting for the finger to heal), but the straps did help with my back/biceps workout in terms of reducing strain on the wrist and allowing my to do pullups, rows, etc., without having my sore finger/wrist stopping me.I did not feel any discomfort that some folks are complaining about. I thought the straps are fine. My skin is pretty tough though, so maybe if you have gentle skin you may be uncomfortable. I was totally fine.I look forward to using these with my heavy deadlifts to see how well they work. Overall, looking at the material used for the straps, I expect them to last for a while. Hopefully the padding will stay attached as well, that's my only concern.
"
1,SPORTS,Harbinger Padded Cotton Lifting Straps with NeoTek Cushioned Wrist (Pair),$8.99,5.0,"
  These work great. Simple and strong. I use them while doing front squats--my wrist flexibility isn't good enough to do it with the ""hook grip"" you use for a clean+jerk, so I instead wrap these and grip them. It helps hold the bar no matter how slick my sweaty shoulders get. As you'd expect/hope with lifting straps, they're also easily tossed into a gym bag to take everywhere. The added padding on the inside is nice, but I don't actually use them in that way, so I can't remark on that functionally. My favorite part is the color. I wear pink converse while lifting, so these make me feel like an adorable coordinated BEAST.
"
1,SPORTS,Harbinger Padded Cotton Lifting Straps with NeoTek Cushioned Wrist (Pair),$8.99,5.0,"
  My grip strength was lagging behind my deadlift weight so I decided to try out straps. Bought a pair for my work out partner as well because it was cheap.I do over-over grip because over-under I felt imbalances. Sure I won't be lifting huge numbers with over-over, but I am not a competitive power lifter and have no need for a 600 lb+ deadlift. My grip was going at 315 lb, but with the straps it made for easy lifting.  It is a good size for me and the padding around the wrist gives me comfort. So far I have no issues with it and would recommend for price and value.

  I  gave one to my daughter and kept one for myself. The grandkids ( I-, 2-, and 4-years old) spend more time falling on their faces than they do on their feet. Their Mom has a rule that there must be blood in order to use a Band Aid. I only had dumb ones at my house and one of those cute babies wanted one. She looked through all of mine and tried a couple on, then said she really didn't need any! She broke my heart! That's when I decided to get Paw Patrol. She won't stick her nose up at Grandma's first aid next time :)

  As a mom (NOT a medical expert) I try to always have a box of character Band-Aids like this around for small incidents. The two sizes included aren't perfect for every possibility, but cover most simple childhood scrapes. I find that for most situations, these are just sticky enough so that they don't fall off too easily, but aren't too traumatic to remove. And of course the characters (in this case, Paw Patrol) provide some real benefit in terms of soothing and distracting a hurt child. Your only issue might be a child wanting to wear them as stickers when they aren't needed!These probably aren't the ONLY bandages you'll ever need in your first aid kit; I like having a wider range of sizes and some waterproof ones for different situations. But as a mom, I think these are a great basic for soothing and protecting the most common little kid incidents.

  Even when you are not dealing with a cut, scrap or skin burn... you have to have one of these Band-Aids.  The characters are so fun and the Band-Aids are so colorful.  They come in a cute little box and young children cannot resist them.  They stick on ok and do the job but lets be honest... they're stickers not for wounds.  If I didn't put them on the tip top shelf of the medicine cabinet the box would last less than a day.  They don't seem to be very waterproof nor do they stick very well.  But children also play and relocate them on their bodies considering every little minor injury needs a paw patrol Band-Aid asap!  Compared to cloth or medical grade ones these aren't nearly as good.  However, they make the pain to away and put a smile on their face.  For anything serious we will stick to the heavy duty less attractive ones but for small cuts and scrapes my FSA will buy me these to turn frowns upside down.

I had a cut on my arm and i used this bandaid after a while i started ro itch on the corner of the bandaid (not even where the cut was) i ignored the itching.

I removed it and just threw them all away. After removing itch went away.

  I'm going to be perfectly straightforward on this review and share things I don't like to normally share. I am 5'3"", and around 400 lb. Thyroid problem. I'm trying to lose weight so don't judge please. I also have massive thighs. I thought because I was so heavy I should get the extra large ball. The one that tops out at 75 cm because I figured my weight would squish it down enough to where I could use it as an office chair and then exercise on it during my lunch break. Don't do that. Follow the chart and get the ball corresponding to your height and not your weight because you can always make the ball a little firmer but you can't make it smaller. My legs are short and I practically have to climb onto this thing to sit on it and the only way I can keep my feet grounded is to straddle and it is still very comfortable sitting in front of my desk but I have absolutely no way to move it without having to climb off and then climb back on. My husband is a few inches taller than me so I'm going to give him this one for his gaming room and I ordered the smaller size. Also the foot pump is way more awesome than a hand pump cuz you do get a work out but it does take a little while so if you have a little air compressor (I have an AirHawk) I literally filled the ball in a fraction of the time. Seriously. I highly recommend using something else if you have it but if anything the foot pump is vastly superior to the hand pumps that the other brands offer. I'm sitting on this thing right now and bouncing on it like crazy and it's taking everything I'm giving it. I will not post a picture because I'm a little embarrassed of my size right now ( I gained quite a bit away in a couple years after my thyroid gave out and I don't like where I'm at right now and that's why I'm trying to lose weight. I've never been a little girl but I've never been this big either) but this thing is taking all I am dishing out and I'm bouncing pretty hard on it I did my research and I'm very pleased with this brand and this ball I just need one a little smaller. Looking forward to tightening some muscles and not hurting my hips sitting in an office chair all day long. I also very much enjoy the color selection.

  The ball itself works well and is very comfortable to sit on.  Im currently 9 months pregnant and it really takes away my pelvic pain!  I got the biggest ball they had which worked great for me because I'm a tall woman I'm 6ft1in. The only complaint I have is the ball itself came with some scuff marks on it which to me is tacky.Update!The seller sent me a new ball for no charge! It shows me that they care about the customers! The new ball I got was perfect!

  Leaks air. Pump it up, use it....then pump it again. Cannot find a hole to patch or fix. It just... leaks air somehow. Maybe i got a dud.UPDATE: The company has replaced the ball. I did, indeed, have a dud. The replacement is exactly was i was hoping for. I filled it up the first time, used it for a week, then filled it the rest of the way (allows the material to finish stretching after being squished down to fit in the box). i am completely satisfied with this ball, and will recommend it for everyone needing one.The multiple sizes are great for a variety of activities. The box includes a pump so there is no need to go out and buy one. The material is non-slip, so the ball stays put on my wooden floors, and my bottom doesn't slide off.All in all? One of the best purchases i've ever made.

  I purchased this ball for use in my office at work.  Between work, school, and driving I sit 4/5 of my day, so I chose to try an exercise ball as a way of alleviating some minor back and hip pain.  I am 5'6"" and about 250lb so I was really torn as to which size to choose.  My legs are short but I'm a hefty girl so I wasn't sure if I should stay with the size for my height or move up a size to comply with my weight.  I eventually chose the 75cm based on other reviews and  I could not be happier!!  The instructions to inflate were a little hazy, which is my only complaint, but I managed using other reviews and the Q&A section on Amazon.  They talk about inflating the ball to the 'mark', then waiting 24 hours and inflating it a second time.  There is no clear direction about where the 'mark is'.  They give you a paper strip of measuring tape but it is not marked, so that's where I was confused.  What they meant (assuming I finally understood it correctly) was to use the measuring tape to measure out the indicated size of your ball (mine was 75cm) and mark it on a wall or something (I used a yardstick).  Then inflate the ball until the top of the ball hits the mark that YOU made.  Then wait 24 hours then inflate it again.  Like I said, a little confusing, but once it's explained it's super easy.  I figured it out and now I've been using the ball for a little more than a week and am thrilled.  I love the color (I bought the Turkis, which is sort of a fun turquoise) and it's super durable.  I've gotten so many compliments!  It's pretty heavy weight and while I was a little hesitant to put all of my weight on it at first, now I bounce and roll around for hours at a time with no trouble!My back and hips are feeling much better, even after a short time, and I find myself moving around a lot more (being active, not rolling off of it!) than I did before in my rolling office chair.  I highly recommend this product but wish the instructions were more clear.

  Lasted from August 19th-October 24th- updating my review to show the power in customer service. After finding out my yoga balls were not returnable, I was a bit bummed.  I’m currently using these yoga balls in my 3rd grade classroom for flexible seating.  After one ball started showing signs of leaking and constant pumping back up, I submitted my review to show the time frame of one of my flawed yoga balls.  The company contacted me immediately, and to my surprise sent me two new balls to tryout with my students.  They absolutely will be thrilled to see their favorite yoga ball back in the classroom!! Thank you- the power of customer service...

  I bought these in white and black.  I cannot say enough about these socks.  I purchased them because my foot and ankle had become very swollen and after wearing them for just a day, the swelling was gone.  I decided to continue wearing them every day and I must say that my feet no longer hurt and my legs do not tire out the way they used to.  Anyone who is on their feet (nurses, cashiers, bank tellers...anyone) all day will find that these socks dramatically lessens your daily discomfort.  Even if you don't think you are experiencing discomfort, you will know it once you try these socks and feel so much better.  I now have 9 pair and when they need to be replaced, I will only purchase these socks and only  from this vendor.About the vendor....I had an issue with my order because instead of 6 socks (3 full pairs) arriving, 5 arrived.  Things happen and especially now with the Christmas/Holiday rush on.  So, I wrote them and didn't expect to hear anything for a few days but the next day I had an email explaining how sorry they were and that they were sending me 2 pairs of the socks to replace the one sock that was missing.I must say, in case you don't know, these are truly compression socks.  They do not slide right on your foot and up your leg, you have to work them but that is what you want.  They are meant to be worn while you are active so don't sleep in them.  I purchased a man's L/XL because I am overweight and have always had a very wide foot 8W.  At 5'4"", these socks are a bit long for me, but I am happy with the fit...I just fold it over (knee sock style) at the top.I've bought some for my very tall sisters-in-law for Christmas.  They are on their feet 8 hours per day and probably don't even know they need these...oh, they need them for sure.Care:  I just pop them in the washer and dryer and they come out good as new.  I wouldn't use any oxygenated detergent or cleaners with them as that type of product attacks spandex/elastic and the compression aspect of the sock will soon disappear.

  I have some problems with edema when I'm on my feet too long. I substitute teach and on those days especially, my ankles swell. I bought these in the hopes that they would give me support and improve circulation and thus the edema and they worked perfectly this past week. I was on my feet two days in a row and when I returned home after 8 hours, my ankles were their normal size.

  So I wear a size 8 1/5 to 9 in shoes with large cakes so I ordered the l/xl. These worked out great, BUT they took the swelling in my legs and feet down so much that they are now too big. I just ordered the small/medium and they fit perfectly. My circulation has improved tremendously.

  So, with too much time working at my desk, I now have a need for compression socks.  I was very fortunate to come across these, and, after ordering the first set of three (yes, three, for only ten bucks!), I liked them so much I wound up buying 3 more sets, so I have them to wear all week.They are a ""starter"" level of compression, so it was a good beginning for me, and, although it took a bit of getting used to, I have to say I like compression socks now.  Kind of feel like a superhero, haha.The fit on these is outstanding, and my legs and feet feel great, even after a full day at the office.  I like that they are thin, so they fit nicely in my shoes.  As far as the copper bit, according to research, copper has no therapeutic benefit, although it does fight odor.  I keep my feet very clean so that's not an issue, although it's always nice to add another layer for sweet smelling feet.  But, on the compression side, these are effective and definitely are helping my feet and legs be more comfortable.They are holding up well in the wash so far and no holes, rips or tears in daily use.  Apparently compression socks should be replaced very 3 or 4 months so the compression factor doesn't decrease due to normal wear, but, at ten bucks for three pairs, these are frankly on par with just regular socks, which have gone up in price, but down in quality.  Hard to even find decent regular athletic socks anymore.Given that it's summer now, and the weather is crazy hot, I actually have switched to a crew length compression sock from ADLU (sold on Amazon) because these socks, with shorts, render a lederhosen look, of which I'm not a fan, but I can still wear these at home or when sleeping.To up the therapeutic effect, I invested in the much more expensive (20 bucks for ONE pair) Wanderlust compression socks (more compression) and they are also awesome, super comfy and a lot more padding.  But, I think it's too much padding, and will make my shoes too tight, so I will likely stick with these, especially at this great price, and use the Wanderlust socks just for sleeping.  Seems it's good to have a mix of compressions anyway, and, even though these are lower, it's still enough compression, according to research, to have a positive effect in promoting blood circulation.In any event, these were a big win for me.  Excellent product at a fantastic price.

  I hesitated making this purchase because it's simply hard to judge fit when you are buying online.  However, after reading all the reviews, I felt confident enough to buy these compression socks.  My husband loves them!  He is completely sedentary and these socks are so much more comfortable and easier to put on than others he's had.  They look more masculine than the traditional while compression socks and they do keep the swelling down.  He says he is so much more comfortable now, sleeping better, etc.  I'll be buying more of these.

  I have ordered these balls for my students at the end of the year, for the last three years. This was the first year I was very disappointed. First, I didn't receive all of my order and didn't think to count the balls before I passed them out. Never had to before. My husband ordered a couple packs on his account since he had a credit, and then I decided to order two more for my PM class as well on my account... same vendor. Was so glad that some students didn't show the last day of school or I would have been short.Of the balls I did receive, unfortunately, some students had a pin hole in their balls and their autographs shrunk as their balls deflated. Was expecting 48 balls. Can't explain how I was short 14. Had I at least had the extra, I could have replaced the ones with holes.

  This is a quality bat and ball set.  It is plastic but the thicker type that has a bit of weight to it. Our kindergarten grandson told us this summer that he needed more bats so had a choice like the real baseball players and he needed them to be different sizes and shapes.  So being good grandparents, we ordered some bats and balsl. This set was immediately  his favorite.  He says that he is a better ball player with it and can hit the ball farther.  We are practicing both with a T and pitching.  Even the older kids usually choose this bat over others. Now he says we should have just purchased a few of this kind since they are the best. We can easily recommend this set.

  Glad to have found these Blitzballs. My Shepard puppy Max loves the sound of the ball when it comes off that bat (that popping or wack sound). He hard charges out in the field and brings it back for a session of keepaway.  But what surprised me more was the fact that he doesn't  try to destroy it. Happy to have it in his mouth with light chomps. So it's a win win for us. They go far, they are easy on his mouth, he gets a great workout and they last.  Thanks Blitzball!

  The bat came a bit smashed on the bottom handle, so probably not very sturdy. It is plastic after all. The ball is interesting because it's not perfectly round and this probably allows for kids to hit it pretty far. I have a four year old daughter and she hits the ball pretty far for her age for her first time ever. Her first hit was probably 15 feet in the air. She also smacked the ball on three occasions about 20 feet. I'm not so sure the bat will hold up after time, but in the mean time I'm sure this ball and bat will do just fine for my 4-year-old.

I wasn’t impressed when I got it, seemed like not much of a gift, but he was VERY excited to get it, immediately ran out in the rain to p,at with it & hit balls for almost an hour until it was too dark to see. He loved the randomness of where the balks land. I gave it 4 stars in value for money because it really is pretty cheap - but sturdy, from our experience - for the money.

  Not worth the money. The net pole cracked the moment it was staked into the ground and a string broke on the net. The volleyball was thinner than a ball you buy at the store. The shuttlecocks broke apart after 2 games and were warped so they did not fly properly. We really tried to make it work. Unfortunately we ordered it for a party that got rained out and by the time it was opened it was too late to return, so frustrating!

  Junk. Save your money. Assembly instructions were not clear, but my husband and I were able to figure out how to put it up based on logic. Worked great for about an hour. Then as soon as someone ran into it, the pole broke. The poles are cheaply built and not sturdy at all. They aren't very stable in the ground. Horrible quality. I saw that it got mixed reviews before I bought, but honestly I didn't want to spend a lot of money and all of the high rated sets I found were pricey. Just looking for an inexpensive set for the kids to play in the backyard and for the occasional party. This set didn't even last one day. Not worth it.

  It's very cheaply built. The net itself isn't very wide and the poles are short. We will replace the poles. The net already had a snag in it when we opened it up and I can tell it won't last long. The birdies were both bent so we bought new ones as well. The ball it comes with much smaller than a normal volleyball, so we will have to get a new one. It's got a lot of lines to stake down for bracing the poles which is nice. The racquets are nice, and it will all serve it's purpose for a little while, but if we had older kids they would have been super disappointed in the size of everything.

  Poor quality and materials. The net on a volley ball court is supposed to be about seven and a half to eight feet high. The plastic poles that came are not even long enough once set in the ground. Poles are flimsy, ball is cheap badminton birds were flattened in packaging. Franklin normally has much better quality. As a matter of fact I bought a second Franklin ball at wally world for 5 bucks and it is far superior in quality.We bought this as a yard game for a BBQ and probably will seldom use it. But for me to have to go buy another ball and poles just to make sure it could be used one weekend is pretty bad. Fault is on the manufacture not the seller. I bought this based on what Franklin sells at wally world.

  The only reason I gave this a 2 on assembly was because they didn’t send 2 of the 6 poles to put it together! We played 2 times and 1 racket fell apart ( the head of it) it’s hollow handle rackets. It’s very cheaply made. Contacted company and they are suppose to send other 2 poles. We will see if they arrive. Wish I would have bought a sturdier set. Update: 2 weeks later and they have failed to send my piles that didn’t come in the box. Or replace the rackets that were broken after 2 uses! So upset that I wasted my money!

1,SPORTS,Speedo Unisex-Adult Swim Cap Silicone,$9.99,2.0,"
  My last Speedo silicone cap lasted 9 years!  (The Amazon product page says I bought this model in 2009.)I swim at least 4 hours a week in the sunlight.  Now that is durability!  Of course I ordered the same model when it finally ripped last week.I just received the new one and was so sad to discover that this cap is no where near as thick as it once was.  It also no longer has the textured inner surface.  This cap is inferior and shouldn't even be advertised as the same model.  No wonder there are now so many reviews describing the things ripping soon after purchase.Speedo may think it's profitable to spend less on the products, thus causing them to wear out quicker and thus selling more?  They did the same with their goggles and suits.  I moved on to Aqua Sphere and TYR for those respectively over the years and now I will look to another brand for caps.

  I like these Speedo silicone swim caps. I have a few in different colors and they last forever. They're nice and thick so they feel sturdy and like they won't rip apart when placed on one's head. I have long thick hair and easily place them on my head. They feel good on and I never have to readjust them. This purple color is very pretty in person (much darker in the photo).

  I have fine hair but a lot of it. This worked well when my hair was just below the shoulder. It stayed on my head and my hair stayed mostly dry.My hair is a couple inches longer now and this isn't working well at all. The cap begins to pull up off my head at the end of a single 20yd pool length, and after a tenth of a mile my hair is entirely wet.The quality of the material is good. For fine hair, this will not pull at you. I wash it inside out and dry it after each use. However, I often grown my hair 6-8 inches below my shoulder. That's what I consider long hair. This cap is no good for that.

  Worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon; product should be taken off the market.  I am not a weak person but I could not take apart the hoop sections at all, no matter how hard I pressed on the button spot.  Also, two of the segments were damaged and could not even be put together; now i cannot even return it since I cannot get it apart.  This is a  horrendously bad product.

  This was such a good purchase! I wanted a way to get exercise at home that was also something I would enjoy, and I heard that hula hooping could be a good waist trainer, so I thought a weighted one was a good idea. Assembly is very easy, the only thing is I personally have to move the foam exterior to press the buttons when I'm taking it apart, which isn't really that big of a deal. I ended up cutting my nails because when you're starting out trying to learn to hula hoop and you have to constantly grab and re-spin the hoop, it is very easy to stick long nails into the foam and damage it. With practice I was able to improve my hooping skills in one day, but I highly recommend starting out slow, because I hooped for 60 minutes one night and my hip was pretty bruised, which is completely on me. I love the option to adjust the size, because some people need more room and some don't have as much.  I can't say how effective it is exercise-wise since I really just started, but I'll make sure to update- so far I think it's worth it!

  I love this hula hoop! It is adjustable so you can make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs. It’s padded so it doesn’t hurt your hips. It also came with a jump rope and resistance  band. It’s weighted, but it isn’t heavy.

  This sleeve is not like other sleeves. I should know, I’ve gone through most of them. I have been suffering from plantar fasciitis for about a year and as I work on my feet all day this has been a very distressing problem for me. I got help from a specialist who helped me with exercises and I’ve tried a bunch of different insoles and foot supports. Some of these helped a bit but the pain was still bad and it started to affect the way I walked. I finally bit the bullet and brought this because of the good reviews, and I’m very glad I did. This ankle brace has helped me so much with my pain, it’s not too bulky like other ones I’ve tried that won’t even fit in my shoe. This brace gives support but still thin enough to not cause issues or discomfort. The extra support strap provided was novel to me, it was so easy to adjust the tightness and it provided heavenly support to the bottom heel area. I just woke up after working three days straight with only a niggle at the base of my foot, I could cry from happiness! I've also got slim feet and ankles so I thought it would be too loose like other ones I’ve tried, but that wasn’t the case as the design of the material of the strap appears to be supportive whatever the stretch without sagging. It also appears to have the ability to hold up for quite some time if it’s taken care of..Also worth mentioning, when I first received the brace it had a slight defect on the velcro, it did function as normal however so it didn’t really bother me. The company contacted me after a few days asking about my buyer experience and my thoughts about the product, I let them know about the defect and they immediately sent me out a brand new one, without me having to return the first one to save me the hassle of the return process. The level of customer service from sleeve stars was extraordinary and very rare these days. I would certainly recommend both the product and the company and wish that all companies dealt with their customers so well as they do. Without a doubt one of the best online purchases I‘ve made and sleeve stars are setting the standards for online customer service.

  My husband suffers from many different foot issues (has broken ankles multiple times, has hammer toes and so problems with balls of feet/weight distribution, bad arches, etc.) and has trouble walking for any good bit of time (e.g., going to the mall, going on a hike, sightseeing on vacation, etc.). I bought him these compression sleeves with the ankle support hoping they’d help on a South African Safari trip and he LOVES them! He’s tried lots of other similar products and has found them to be too bulky or too constricting. But he says THESE sleeves are PERFECT — just the right amount of compression and soft! And he says the ankle wrap provided gives the perfect amount of support, too. He is 6’2, 220lbs., with size 10.5/11 feet and fairly small/thin ankles.

  So far so good! I just got them and today is my first day of wearing them. It does seem like it holds my foot in place a little better thus helping to relieve some of the pressure when I step. I thought when I purchased that this came in a pair? but it is just a single sock with wrap. I'm glad ordered two so I do have one for each foot.  I put my socks over and we will see how it goes !  Oh ya I forgot to mention that I have wide feet so it's nice but these don't go all the way up do the ball of your foot, I tried different brand but that brand was too tight. These seem to be better.

  First off, I did not receive this free or discounted , I  paid 14 bucks.  I hate reading a review that gets me all excited then seeing that.  So the sock is pretty good, helps with plantar fasciitis for me, not awesome but pretty good.  Amazingly, there was a free bonus strap that I had no clue what to do with til the seller sent an email with instructions.  It goes under the arch, crosses in front and it back around the ankle, then velcros itself.  Too big for under shoes I think.  Anyway, tried it today and it was freakin' amazing.  It won't heal plantar fasciitis, but it made the pain stop so I could walk for awhile.  If you get this it won't have bonus strap instructions, and I no longer have the email or I'd post them.  So ask the seller right away for how the strap works if you have plantar fasciitis pain.  Again, not a miracle cure, but somehow holds the arch and ankle so the pain subsides tremendously.

  Looked at several compression type garments for ankle sprain but reviews were all over the place as far as sizing/fit, and if I managed to measure properly and get one that fits now with swelling would it be too large to be effective in a few days when the swelling started to subside (requiring a second purchase)? Came across this one which also included a separate compression wrap which allows for an adjustable fit. It's perfect! The sleeve itself is thick, very soft and comfortable to wear, and the separate wrap has allowed me to adjust not only for fit but  also the location of where I want the most pressure applied. Fyi, given it's thick it might be tough to wear with a loafer type shoe but would likely be fine w/lace ups or slides.

  I have been having some pain on my left ankle due to my recent bad “bone-cracking” habits. This ankle brace is a great pain relief for that ankle of mine in addition to the pain relief lotion I have been taking. It is pretty comfortable for me to wear it. It also gives me a smooth and soft touch feel to my painful ankle as described. Additionally, I can use the adjustable strap to increase the level of support my painful ankle as needed or necessary. The Instruction Manual shows how easily to use the adjustable strap. I can still move freely when doing routine exercises at home by wearing this ankle brace on without any problem. For these reasons, I may buy it again to keep as a spare or to give as a gift to my relative.

  I received the product quickly, but I would like to give a word of advice to those of you ladies who are hourglass shaped like me.  I bought the small based on the size chart because I have a 26.5 - 28 in waist (depending on TOM), but my hips are 36.5 - 37 inches.  I'm 5 feet tall, but even at my natural waistline, the brace is not long enough to hug the area I need it to.  My back pain is very low (L5 and coccyx), so to get relief, I need to wear it around my hips.  It was tight wearing it that low, but I got no relief wearing it at my natural waistline.  The company is great and is allowing me to return for the correct size.  I will update my review when I receive it.  If you are shaped like me, size up so that it can comfortably fit around your hips.

  I have 4 herniated lower back discs. I couldn't cook dinner without crying. I tried this back brace the first day, and it hurt like Hell. However, today I removed the removable lumbar triangle and gave it another shot. I am happy to report that not only was I able to cook dinner for my family with no pain, I emptied the dishwasher AND took out the trash! Now I'm playing cards like a normal human being. I got this brace because I have a trip planned to Ireland (the land of my people) in June. I didn't think I would be able to go. Now, I believe there is hope. Thank you soooo much!UPDATE: This back brace saved my butt on holiday. Made it through 10 days of airports, trains and non-stop walking all over Ireland and Scotland. The trick is not to make it too tight (or too loose). Again, I also removed the removable lumbar support. I didn't even get double screened at the airport with it on. Fantastic!

  Was on the larger end of the sizing chart, so had to return it for the larger size.  If you are on the top end, buy the larger size or it will be uncomfortably tight.  Really like the style and it works really well.

  This brace is great.  Sizing is tough to understand, had to exchange for size smaller.  I’m a size 35” waist most of the time, occasionally get down to a 34” when really active.  I purshased the large, had to send back for medium.  I’d say you need to be at the very least 47-50” waist for the large.  These products are meant to stretch to size.  My 35” waist provided an easy 6” gap of loose material when wearing the brace.  Really the only con with the brace is that the Velcro sections are only a couple few inches wide, meaning you have to purchase the perfect size or it won’t work.  I especially like the lumbar pad, good for my exact injury.

  I have L5-S1 Spondylolisthesis + 3 lumbar level disc herniations. I am in pain if I stand for more than 2 hrs.; I've found using a Lumbar Support Belt doubles for activity tolerance. I've had 3 of those copper-infused belts, with daily use the elasticity loses it shape after 6 mo. I used more substantial belts, but they pop-off due to my (now 47"" waistline).  also used belts with hard plastic stays that are encased in pouches. These are uncomfortable. This Sparthos back brace is the best compromise. It is substantially more supportive than the flimsy belts; it is more comfortable than the plastic stay belts. The sizes are very generous. I have a Medium belt. Size Large is for waist of 50"" or more. It has a secondary ""overlying strap"" ( see advert.) which can be cinched down for more support when standing/walking, but may be relaxed when sitting. I am a retired physician. I suggest you try this belt before wasting your money on the alternatives described in this review.

  This back brace was approved by my chiropractor. It does help, but honestly I didn't find it as comfortable as a brace I previously wore. I thought it would be more comfortable based on other reviews. The issue for me was that only part of it stretches so it was difficult to get it at the right tightness without being too tight. A brace I used previously had just a bit of stretch all the way around so while it supported you, it also moved with you just a bit. It didn't feel so much like a guillotine around your middle. Still, this brace can help considerably with back pain. If you find it uncomfortable for long periods of time but really need a quality back brace, simply take small breaks from wearing it.Make sure to measure your waist where you will be wearing the brace and order your size accordingly. That is the only way to ensure you choose the correct size.

  My husband has had major back problems for years.  His life consists of slipped discs, sciatica, cortisone shots, surgeries, pills, arthritis, and of course pain.  It's a given that his line of work (remodeling) has taken a major toll on his body.  He has always wore back braces and there were many, many days of him coming home hunched over in pain.  He has worn this brace for 3 days now and you would not believe the difference, even on the day working close to 10 hours!  He is no longer hunched over; he is feeling pretty good.  He even said it has affected his mood, as he's not hurting while he's working anymore.  Obviously it hasn't ""cured"" his problems - he still has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning - but this brace has been nothing sort of amazing for him.  Thank you Sparthos!!!

  I ordered this mainly for the air pressure gauge. I am a soccer coach and wanted to make sure my soccer balls were inflated properly. Other gauges I had purchased previously were inaccurate and/or did not work at all. This gauge works very well and it is easy to use. I would highly recommend this kit just for the gauge.As far as the pump goes, it also works great. I had another pump already, but I have actually replaced it with this one. What I like about it is that the hose and need are very easy to remove from the pump and reattach. I don't like leaving the needle attached because I get holes poked in my bag. With this pump, I either unscrew the hose with needle attached and carry it separately, or I sometimes leave a rubber band wrapped around the pump, and when I am done using it, I fold the hose up against the pump and secure it with the rubber band. This keeps the needle close to the pump and doesn't allow it to poke holes in my bag or anything in my bag.I highly recommend this kit, as it is easy to use, works flawlessly up to this point, and is inexpensive.

  Wow. Not sure why this has such high reviews. It is very, very cheap. Not worth the money. The pump part is completely unstable, if you stop pumping for a second air starts to escape from the ball. I bough this because of the tube option at the end. However I’m quickly regretting it. My last ball pump was a wilson and that one worked great. I will try it for a bit longer, but I expect it to break within the month.

  I ended up getting this because I ordered a new Basketball since my old one was losing its grip. When it arrived it wasnt pumped up enough and I couldnt find my old basketball pump so I ordered this Franklin one.I will keep this review short since I dont think anyone wants to read an encyclopedia. The Pump works great, you dont need to use the hose that it comes with, even though you can. It comes with 3 needls, a pressure gauge as well as a little carrying case that I wasnt expecting.Other than that, there isnt anything you need to know, other than its worth the money to get a pump that may cost a bit extra and wont have needles snapping on you all of the time.

  Ordered and received this today to have another pump on hand for sports ball inflation.  This is totally cheap and not even worth the low price.  The body of the pump feels like I'm likely to dent or crush it while holding it.  I used it to inflate a mini sized basketball, it took more effort that I thought, not sure how this will stand up to regulation sized balls.I guess it's useful to hang onto for smaller balls or minor jobs but I'm back to looking for a decent option that I know will last.

  This works very well for my needs.  We have several basketballs at home and our house is where all of the other kids seems to gravitate to for playing basketball as well.  I wanted a simple pump to inflate balls when needed.  I also wanted my son to be able to use it without my help.This pump works great and it's easy to use.  We've used this to inflate my son's basketball and his friends basketballs.  I like that this set includes 3 needles, an air pressure guage and a pouch to store everything.  I keep this set in the pouch in the garage so that it can be used whenever we need to do so.  This set is a winner for me, very handy!

  This is a quality bat and ball set.  It is plastic but the thicker type that has a bit of weight to it. Our kindergarten grandson told us this summer that he needed more bats so had a choice like the real baseball players and he needed them to be different sizes and shapes.  So being good grandparents, we ordered some bats and balsl. This set was immediately  his favorite.  He says that he is a better ball player with it and can hit the ball farther.  We are practicing both with a T and pitching.  Even the older kids usually choose this bat over others. Now he says we should have just purchased a few of this kind since they are the best.

  The bat came a bit smashed on the bottom handle, so probably not very sturdy. It is plastic after all. The ball is interesting because it's not perfectly round and this probably allows for kids to hit it pretty far. I have a four year old daughter and she hits the ball pretty far for her age for her first time ever. Her first hit was probably 15 feet in the air. She also smacked the ball on three occasions about 20 feet. I'm not so sure the bat will hold up after time, but in the mean time I'm sure this ball and bat will do just fine for my 4-year-old.

  These are by far the best glasses I've gotten for my money thus far... and I buy a lot because I lose or crush them all the time.What do I like?- The arm springs are firm and appropriately springy.- The form is symmetric so the lenses don't angle strangely on my face.- The tint is dark (almost too dark, but not unreasonable), but these are definitely polarized as advertised.- These fold up compactly so they fit in my car's overhead glasses enclosure.- The nose piece is comfortable, durable, and well placed such that the glasses sit just far enough away to avoid my long eyelashes.- The metal frame appears sturdy. I've had these for a few months now and they show no sign of letting go of the lens.- The weight is good. They don't feel so lightweight as to make you think they are cheap, but they are light enough not to give you a headache after a 500 mile trip.What could be better?- The nose piece is very hard to manipulate (which is part of what makes it so durable).- As I said, the tint is almost too dark.Has Sasquatch helped you make a decision?

  If you are like me, you probably never want to spend more than $10-$20 on a pair of sunglasses.The reason for this is because you are sure you will either lose or ruin your sunglasses and few people will wish to expend any amount of effort, energy or time in their lives worrying about losing or breaking sunglasses. Life's just too short to spend any of it fretting about overly expensive sunglasses—amazing though they may be.Few things in life are more annoying than spending $250 and upwards on a pair of sunglasses only to end up sitting on them, stepping on them, or flat out losing them altogether.But good, quality sunglasses are a significant part of eye health and sharp vision. Proper lenses can go a long way in protecting one's eyes from the harmful effects of the sun's most damaging rays. And that can help in the prevention of cataracts.Enter Sungait. Sungait's glasses offer the feel, quality, style, and comfort of $100-plus eyewear at sub $50 prices. Many of their glasses go for under $20, and they are well worth it.I've had my Sungait glasses for 7 weeks now and have worn them on a daily basis by the pool, at the beach, on the road, and even playing music at gigs. Even though I wore them for several hours they remained thoroughly comfortable due to their lightweight construction. They fell out of my pocket, out of a case, and off a table a few times but suffered no damage or scratches. They are surprisingly tough for such lightweight inexpensive sunglasses – much more durable than other pairs I have had in the same price range.They also look stylish enough that people have asked me what brand they were and where I got them. I live in the tropics where the UV index is frequently above 10, the polarized lenses of my Sungaits block the glare perfectly. They even block the surface glare on the ocean well enough for me to see underwater features.I love my Sungaits for all of these reasons. But the one reason that these are the glasses I will be buying from now on whenever I need sunglasses is simply because they are a superior quality product for a very affordable price.

  I was nervous about buying sunglasses online.  I mean, the fit, the look on your face...that VIBE you get when you put on the right pair.  How could buying without trying ever work out?  Well, these polarized, steel framed gems fit the bill, and my face.  The quality is outstanding and much more than I expected for the price.  Even the packaging was top-notch.I know, I know. Your experience might not be as amazing as mine was. Here's the good news. This company stands behind their product like no other I've heard of.EDIT: I accidentally stepped on my pair and immediately reordered!
"

  Where do I begin...I am extremely pleased with the quality and price of the sunglasses I purchased with Sungait.  My sunglasses arrived on time and when I opened the small box they came in I could not believe how well made the glasses are. The arms  are made of this really nice metal, that feels well made. Also, the nose  cushions are very unique, they are made of some type of rubber and feel very sturdy yet pliable.I was a little concerned about the fit because the bridge is smaller 14 or 16mm instead of 20mm. However, I went based off of the length  of the lens which is 62mm, and they fit great! If you are like me, anytime you go to a place like the Sunglass Hut or other places like that, the sunglasses are just not made to fit your face,  so they look way too small. I was happy that I was able to find my size based on my prescription glasses, and used that information to get a good idea of the size I needed.As if the quality of glasses was not enough, they also came in this handy-soft Pouch, a nice small screwdriver and microfiber cloth. There were two business cards included which one of them mentioned that if you like and follow the company on Facebook they will give you a free product.  I did exactly as the card stated and emailed the company. They responded quickly, within a few hours and requested my contact information  in order to send me my free product.  I imagined the free product would be something small; well, it ended up being another pair of sunglasses! They emailed me 4 different options and let me choose my free pair! They informed me that my free pair of sunglasses would not get to me for another 1 to 2 weeks, but that is a small price to pay for a free pair of quality sunglasses! I can't say enough about this company! I expect that if you purchase from them you will have the same experience I did and if for some reason you don't, I am very positive they will do everything they can to make it right. Best wishes!

  Several notions are being incorrectly perpetuated by many reviewers here with poor grasp of science. First of all, let me say that I own both this Takeya 40 oz thermos flask as well as a 40 oz Hydro Flask. These are comparable products with comparable build quality and performance in keeping fluids cool and delicious. In fact, I like the build quality on the small mouth cap of this more than the cap that comes standard with hydroflask. That alone is worth another $7 to $10. If you have a smaller mouth, you are going to appreciate drinking from this cap much more, trust me.Now, to debunk junk tests that people have been posting in their reviews. If you place 5 cubes of ice in a 40 oz container, then seal it and check on the ice 12 hours later, OF COURSE it is melted. Why? Because you sealed almost 40 oz of room temperature air into the container that the ice has now equilibrated with. If you FILL the container with ice or ice water and then check it 12 hours later, it will be closer to the same temp and structure inside the flask than if you had only partially filled it. The performance level is almost identical to the hydro flask brand but a little weaker since hydroflask has 30% more steel and is 5oz heavier (17oz to 12oz) as a result. As someone who finishes my drink within the workday period and not in 24 hours, I find that the performance is comparable to the Hydro Flask in this regard and that the less weight is actually a benefit.Second thing that is driving me nuts. Placing your flask in the fridge and finding that ice you left inside of it melted the next day does not show a technological failure but actually a SUCCESS. Once again, if you sealed room temperature air and some ice into the container, then place it in the fridge, the inside environment was so well sealed from the outside coolness of the fridge that the ice equilibrated to melt. Thermoses are not meant to ""enhance"" the cooling effect of a fridge. A thermos will only to slow down rate of reaching temperature equilibrium with the outside environment.In summary, if you want to get maximum performance of cooling retention from a thermo flask or hydro flask, try to FILL the container with cold or iced fluid at the beginning of your day. Technology only makes our lives easier when we actually understand how to utilize it.The Takeya Thermo Flask with small mouth spout that opens and closes with a single turn of the top is one of the best values I have found for this type of product.

  We ordered this as a second Takeya bottle we have a 40.oz First off the logo design on this 18oz is different from the bottle pictured and different from the bottles on the Takeya website. Second, it had no insulation, the bottle became ice cold to the touch and it did not stay cold, we did not put hot water in but my guess the bottle would have been too hot to hold.  Just to check we ordered one form the Takeya website and lo and behold it insulates, the bottle is not cold to the touch, which it should not be with double wall insulation. Also it has the correct logo on the side. We could have gotten a lemon, but the different logo kind of tipped me off. Buyer beware with this bottle.

  I am compelled to write this review as I'm sitting on the beach, in summer, trying to melt the rest of the ice in my takeya bottle. We are on hour 3 and it's hot. The fact that there is STILL ice in this thing is amazing. This bottle is awesome. Buy it.

  PLEASE BE AWARE! Do get robbed! IMITATION!This is NOT a good quality! I don't understand because it looks and feels like it. However, does NOT keep liquids cold for long at all. I kinda felt like ice was melting fast, then thought I must be imagining it. I then tested it with a cup style same size stainless steel mug with a somewhat open plastic lid with straw that I bought at a discount store for $9.99. In the morning...NO Ice as suspected with this Takeya Vaccum sealed bottle yet my $9 mug still had plenty of ice & very cold. What a DISAPPOINTMENT as this bottle was $30 BUCks!

  When I received the bottle, THERE WAS TEA IN THE BOTTLE!!! There was about a half an inch of some brown liquid that smelled of tea and what appeared to be surface rust in and around the lip of the bottle. This would be terrible quality control on Amazon's behalf, but being the bottle LEAKS LIKE A SIV, that's terrible quality on Takeya's behalf. Ended up getting the THERMOFLASK with a lifetime warranty, but I doubt I'll half to use it. Don't risk saving a little money on a cheaper bottle. Old cliché sayings have been around forever for a reason. ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!""

  They are exactly what I was looking for in Compression socks! Not so tight that I struggle in pain to get them on in the morning because of the arthritis in my hands but firm enough to give me support all day without making my legs feel like they are being squeezed to the point of being uncomfortable. I should add that I normally wear a medium but ordered these in a large for my comfort. This was my personal choice for what worked best for me. Getting 3 pair for what I have paid for 1 pair is a great value and 1 that I will take advantage of again.

  These are my first pair(s) of compression stockings. I like how they came in a 3-pack and at a great price. They are easy to put on, not too tight, and nice material. At only 27 years old, I noticed some spider veins popping up. I am a nurse and on my feet 12+ hours during a shift. I need to start taking care of my feet/legs and this is the first step!

  I am a woman in my 60s who has problems with swelling in ankles & feet.  My doctors recommended compression socks, which I was not happy about until I discovered these.  The 15-20 mmhg works for me.  I don't have to worry about shoes that fit in the morning and then are painfully tight later in the day.  I also tried 20-30 mmhg compression socks, but they were difficult to get on and I didn't see much more of a difference.  I have ordered 2 additional sets of these because I love them!  Highly recommend.

  I started noticing swollen and aching ankles around 30 weeks. I tried support hose and couldn’t handle the effort required to shimmy into full tights. The great reviews pulled me towards compression socks. Previously I associated compression socks with old diabetic men in strapless sandals. Well with my pride sailing out the door I thought I’d give them a try. I’m so happy that I did. I’ve worn them all day at work, just when I get home, and overnight. Whe wearing them all day I find that I can stay on my feet at least 1-2 hours longer. If these socks don’t jive with your work apparel, I found a lot of relief by putting them on when I get home and wearing them until bed (better than the 20 minutes I was “putting my feet up” for relief). Lastly, I tried wearing them overnight to see if they’d help with my hip and knee pain. No results there unfortunately. Overall, I find that my ankles have been staying pre-Preggo slender and I do not have ankle aches first thing in the morning. For the price it’s worth a shot. I wear women’s 10-11 (41-42) and have wider than average calves. I bought the L/XL and am happy with the fit. I wish I ordered a 6 pack from the get go. I’ll be ordering the multicolored 6 pack ASAP.

  Great products, they were a life saver at a new job that required me to cover a foot tattoo while wearing shoes that showed it. All the colors are professional and work well for jobs where you have to dress nice. They fit as they should have, are a good price and arrive on time and in good condition. They are also comfortable and a wonderful alternative to having to wear, nasty panty hose.

  Not a “traditional” corn bag. Very slick material which causes the bag to slide all over the board. Filler is strange as in it tends to also cause the bag to do strange things in the air. I first thought maybe my husband was complaining because he was sucking at the game with these bags.... or he had too many beers while playing.... bless his heart.... but no. I threw the bags. Our friend threw the bags. Then we threw standard bags and huge difference. Standard bags stick to the landing. These babies turned cornhole into a redneck curling event.

  The construction is not effective. The sand is inside of a plastic bag which is inside of a light weight fabric bag which is inside the outer canvas bag. Originally the weight of the bags ranged from 15 ounces to 15.8 ounces (I did weigh each of on a digital scale them when they arrived), I was willing to overlook the inconsistent weight.  In two weeks of playing with these bags the sand containment has completely failed (the inner bags all ruptured); each bag has lost about an ounce of sand so most bags are well under regulation. The canvas bags are decent quality, that is the bright point in the construction and the carrying bag is effective. Two weeks of use is not acceptable.

  Ordered these in June and they arrived Early July, BUT the shipment was one bag short. I have 4 blue and 3 red.  I wish the ""STARS"" would allow for a method to show the individual rating I assign.  I would say the durability (without actually tossing them) is Predicted to be good due to how they feel in the hand.  The sturdiness looks to be above average, the seams are all well sown and no loose ends.  The value is very good, BUT so far the customer service is non existent. I sent the vendor a private note asking to have one bag sent to me but, alas, no reply, yet.  I'll update the rating IF I get a reasonable result from my request to the vendor and I don't have to send the whole lot back just to get a full set of 8 bags with a new purchase.Update 20200709:I've upgraded my original rating after I was contacted by the vendor about the issue and a new bag will be mailed out.  Perhaps I should be been a little more patient for a response.

  The first use was fine.  The second time, started noticing they were putting off a little dust every time they landed.  Each time we've used them since, it gets worse.  Yesterday they were letting off great clouds of dust on every single impact, whether on the ground or hitting the board.  After a half dozen games there was a solid coating of dust on the board and the ground around the perimeter of both boards was white. Our pants were also dusty. Last evening in trying to ascertain the cause, I looked at the tag.  It said river sand.  So apparently, we are seeing silica dust being created with each impact.  It is not going to get better until there is no sand left the bags to grind up.  If these bags were used on break at a construction site, OSHA would ban them and fine the users.  Would not recommend this product unless you like the idea of possibly contracting silicosis from afternoons of ""harmless"" fun.  We are not going to play with them again but just throw them away for safety's sake. Would be interesting to have weighed them on arrival and after multiple uses to see how much weight was lost to dust escaping.  We paid little enough for them that I'm not going to bother trying to get a refund. Should have read the other 1 star reviews before purchase. Lesson learned.

  I rarely take the time to write reviews any more, but I wanted to make a point to bring this company's generosity to light. I purchased some of their cornhole beanbags before a late summer trip & was very pleased with not only the looks, but the quality & durability of the bags. We loved them. However, my daughter's dog is a devourer of all things that can fit into her mouth & unfortunately one of the bean bags became her casualty. I messaged the company with hopes that they would sell me a single bag to replace the fallen bag, without having to repurchase the entire set. They responded very quickly with a kind email stating that they were shipping me a new set at no cost. With so much negativity in the world lately, i was very taken back with this act of kindness. I have recieved the new set & they have created a forever customer in me. I can not reccomend them enough.

I found these, and both of these undesirable situations were put to rest. The price and speed of delivery were too good to not take a chance on these bags. Not only were they delivered as expected, but the quality of the bags is top notch.

  They leak dust!  We LOVE the look and function of these bags, they're great.  The only issue we have is that there is always a puff of dust that is emitted upon impact, and it leaves imprints on the boards which are painted red, white and blue.  It's not a huge problem and we won't switch them out- at least not for a long time- but I just want others to be aware of what we have seen. Other than that, we get many compliments on the set. I would still not hesitate to buy again just for the overall quality and look, because I assume most products will do the same.

  I've tried several different kinesiology tapes, here are the results of my head-to-head comparisons...In order of stretchiness:KT Tape Pro: Super stretchy spandex-type material. Dries super fast. Breathes excellently even in multiple layers.KT Tape: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape H2O: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape: Moderate-elastic content cotton. Takes the longest to dry but that's still fast. Not very breathable, can feel slightly stifling in multiple layers.In order of stickiness:Rocktape H2O: Can be repositioned, and will stick just as well after repositioning. Sticks to tape well. Can be uncomfortable to remove.Rocktape: Can be repositioned, but loses some stickiness each time. Edges tend to peel up. Doesn't stick to tape very well. Okay removal.KT Tape Pro: Can be repositioned, but won't stick for more than a day if you do.Sticks to tape well. Easily removed.KT Tape: Cannot be repositioned, edges tend to peel. Sticks to tape adequately well. Seems more painful to remove than others.In order of longevity:Rocktape H2O: 3+ days. Stays put until you take it off.KT Tape Pro: 2-4 days. Once you get it stuck on, it stays. Less peeling than Rocktape.Rocktape: 2-4 days. Edges tend to peel up on day 2, so you've got to trim it down.KT Tape: 1 day. Edges and entire parts of strips peel up almost immediately.In order of support:Rocktape: Very stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a lightly structured brace. Useful for areas where you need a lot of stability like knees and ankles.Rocktape H2O: Stable support.Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression brace. Useful for areas where you need both stretch and support, better adhesion and superior stretch offers excellent 'massage' for sore muscles.KT Tape: Moderately stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a compression sleeve.KT Tape Pro: Light to moderate support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression sleeve. Useful for areas where you need flexibility first, particularly well-suited to wrists and fingers.

  I use this stuff for my plantar fasciitis and it actually works! It takes a time or two to learn how to best apply it. For me I find that if I apply it after a shower and really washed the area of application that I can get 5-7 days per application. Make sure not to apply lotions or oils around the strips or else they will come off quicker.Update: after a month of using this product, I discovered the importance of effective exfoliation prior to application. If I exfoliate and wash the area with soap prior to applying mine will last up to 9 days before beginning to peel. Also any non-hairy areas last longer than hairy areas.

  I'm left handed and I've torn my left rotator twice, along with my bicep. To get added support, I bought the KT tape.  My thoughts were that with Kerri Walsh being a sponsor, it must be good stuff and I'm not overjoyed with it.I had a hard time with this and wasted 5 of the 20 strips trying to get it to stick.  To place it for rotator support, it's very difficult to place yourself and the tape has a tendency to ""slingshot"" back when trying to apply it.  It sticks to itself great but it didn't stick well to my skin.  Because I paid $15 for the roll, I'll use what I have left, as best I can but I won't rebuy this brand.** UPDATE 10-08-2017 **KT immediately contacted me after my review was published and as you can see from their response, offered tips and tricks.  Additionally, they offered to replace the roll at no charge.  I gladly took them up on this offer and they shipped the replacement roll, free of charge, immediately.The tips and tricks did help but I still have trouble getting this on myself (because of my injury location), but it's no fault of KT.  My suggestion to you is that if you have a rotator cuff injury that you're trying to support, have someone else put the tape on for you.  The instructions inside the package will also give you a picture of how to apply it correctly for that particular injury location.** Update 2 ***It will help you out tremendously if you buy some alcohol prep pads, which are very inexpensive.  I've found that by wiping down the area with a prep pad and letting it dry, before I apply the KT tape, makes a huge difference.  The tape seems to go on better and adhere to the skin better, in addition to easier removal when you're read to take it off.** Update 3 **I've updated my review to a 5 star rating.  I don't know if KT has improved the adhesive on their product or if the big difference was made by me learning to apply it correctly.  Whatever the situation, this stuff REALLY sticks.Before I apply it, I just pour some alcohol on a paper towel and wipe down the area thoroughly, before letting it dry or wiping it down with another paper towel.  There's no danger of this stuff coming off and I'd suggest when you remove it, that you do so in the shower.  If you pull it too quickly - like a band-aid, you're gonna pull skin.In my opinion, the precut strips are the way to go and here's a tip: When you start to put them on, peel the backing back only about one inch.  This will allow you to get it started without it flopping back and sticking it on itself or on your hands and from there, just slowly remove the backing as you move along the area that you're applying it too. Once I've started it, I just hold the backing tape with my thumb and index finger and I'm moving it along my arm and shoulder.  When you get the technique down, it's easy to apply yourself (unless you're putting it on your back).KT Tape has been a tremendous help to me.  I've reordered three times and will continue to do so in the future.

And it messes with features, such as; the timer when I’m running, going back to the Home Screen, and going to the settings. And it does that in my sleep.-So the way to fix this is to wear it higher on my wrist/forearm... but that’s not as comfortable.-I’ve only had it for a day and I want to try it out for at least a week... but that’s just a dumb feature. I’d rather just tap the top to turn it on than press the sides. Who came up with that?- I don’t like that I run for 30 minutes but it changes it to a higher number because “active zone” or whatever gives you 2x the minutes. If I run for 30 minutes... I run for 30 minutes! It says I exercised for 99 minutes... but I only did 69 minutes. It gave me 2x the minutes. That’s just dumb and confusing.- I also don’t like that I can’t zoom in on my sleeping log and see the graph.Update: I’m returning it

  I purchased this Inspire 2 as in upgrade to my old Alta HR. I liked the Alta HR because it had a slim profile and was simple to use. The Inspire 2 has two flaws that are deal breakers for me. 1: you cannot change the “apps” that display on the face - so if someone was looking at my Fitbit they could see my weight. I am a teacher, my students play with my Fitbit at times and I don’t need them to know that personal information. 2: Whenever my wrist and arm touch together, it makes my Fitbit vibrate. I have worn it for not even an hour and had to take it off because it was annoying.I spend nearly 1/2 an hour on the phone with Fitbit customer service for them to go through their whole speech, to find out these a “features” that can’t be removed.

  My four year old Charge 2 HR battery was getting weak so I decide to buy a new Inspire 2 and I’m glad I did.First of all, it does everything and more than what my Charge 2 HR did for me, which was quite a lot.  Without taking advantage of the free Premium offer, all the data presentation I enjoyed with the older Charge 2 HR is included in Inspire 2.  Plus improvements in looks, screen brightness, a much longer battery life and a link to my phone GPS for improved tracking of my long walks.The negative reviews I’ve read revolve mostly around the irritation of the vibration notifications.  To preempt those problems I immediately turned off almost all of the notifications.  Do you really need your watch tell you your phone is ringing?  Or you can’t remember that you’ve been sitting in your chair for the last hour?The setup was super easy.  From your current app account, add a device and make sure it synchs to your new Inspire 2 so all of the data stored in your old Fitbit ports into you new device.  I just let the battery run out on my old Fitbit and will soon delete it from my account.For only $99 this is a great device.

  I'm really sad that this Inspire 2 is catching so much grief in the reviews here, but what I believe it boils down to is most people only leave bad reviews. If someone is happy with something they usually won't take the time to come on an write about it unless it is beyond brilliant. I wont go so far as to say this fitbit is that, but it is a wonderful gadget and personally I find no truths in what many here are complaining about. Firstly I would like to start with, if comparing to the HR and making a decision between the two, definitely go with the newer model. It does more; like the 24/7 heart rate monitor which is really great to keep an eye on, the active zones and a great battery life. So far I've gone 4 days with no charge and only gotten to 65%, that's incredible to me. Not to mention this new model includes a free year of premium which has a lot of great stuff in it like fitness guides and mediation exercises.When I was making the decision I read pros and cons comparisons and ultimately it was these and the sluggish touch screen on the HR that led me to choose the Inspire 2. I'm glad I did, I have zero regrets. And for some reason this is cheaper right now than the older model! (Edit: it looks like that was  pre holiday sale and it's more expensive now which does make sense, it is better) It's functioning flawlessly. It was a great price, is very easy to use, and really is a good little motivator.I love the gentle alarms, the relax exercises, and the little reminders to drink water and exercise. The sleep tracking is really fascinating and a personal goal of mine to work on, this is a major help to me in that regard. I love that it is swim safe as well, since I'm big on swimming.I have pretty small wrists, and while it sits off of it a bit, it's not overly bulky and is light, and by no means bothersome.Also the recommendation for wearing it is slightly loose, not snug, and I find the best position for it is just above the ulna.As far as people having trouble with it getting stuck on one screen and always showing their weight or constantly buzzing with alerts? That is 100% user error. I will say with confidence if you take your time to sit down and just read through and explore the app with patience, it is all very user friendly. These screens can be backed out of, changed, and alarms/ reminders set or cancelled.There was also a review that mentioned there's no way to view the HR on the main screen, and you have to swipe through 5 times or so to get to it. While that is one way, there is also the quick function on the home screen just below the clock, tapping this will cycle through which to display (HR, calories, active zones, miles, and steps) so you can have your HR and time visible anytime.My two biggest ""issues"" with it which are very minor, would be the band, which tends to irritate the skin slightly with constant wear. Cleaning, switching wrists or bands is a simple solution.The other one is that the steps aren't incredibly accurate, they give a rough idea, but I tend to halve mine based off of my walking routes that I know. This is a broad guess on my part, steps matter least to me but it's probably closer to 75% accurate.Keeping that and the relatively low price in mind, I think this is a wonderful all over health tracker and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality tracker at a reasonable price and healthier lifestyle. It is a small piece of plastic that I find quite incredible at what it is capable of doing for being so tiny, and am amazed at all of the extras in this!

  I have the Alta HR and the face is pretty scratched.  I have short arms so all the Fitbits are too large.  I was so excited when this came in yesterday and it is about the same size as my Alta.  But then every time I bent my wrist and it had skin to skin contact it immediately vibrated.  There are no buttons just to turn it on, you just finger touch both sides.  Obviously you flex your wrist all day.  All of those vibrations every 2 minutes or sooner is a hard fail and there isn't a touch sensitivity that you can play with.  My other problem is that it didn't give me the reminders to move, even though I had it turned on.  So it's being returned and back to my scratched Alta :-(

  This is a great, five star product BUT DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! I've now had three 2.5oz tubes ($45 worth of Body Glide) arrive to me a useless, gooey mess because at some point in the Amazon warehouse the tubes were allowed to sit above their recommended storage temperature and change consistency. How do I know? Because I left a good tube of Body Glide in my car on a summer day once and this is what it turns in to. It applies thick, wears off easily, and is overall miserable. Buy it from a local store (a lot of big chain stores now carry it) or directly from Body Glide on their site (never had a gooey one directly from them). Just don't buy it from Amazon.

  Omg this stuff is the best! I am a chubby girl and I recently went to Thailand where it was 90° with a 70% humidity every single day I was there. This stuff got me through! I was able to wear dresses and shorts with no chafing! And I only ever had to apply in the morning and once in the middle of the day! My life is forever changed I’ve already ordered two more!
"
1,SPORTS,Body Glide Original Anti-Chafe Balm,$14.99,5.0,"
  I am a lifelong curvy lady whose thighs have rubbed together since the beginning of time, probably, so I’m no stranger to chafing. I heard about this product a long time ago, but for some reason I didn’t trust it - it wouldn’t work for me, somehow, and so I disregarded it. I wear cotton bike shorts under my dresses, and that helps a little, but there’s still bare parts of my skin that touch and I can’t wear them with denim shorts, rompers, etc.I continued to read good things, and as summer was fast approaching and we were set to have our first Very Hot weekend of the year, I ordered the smallest size and told myself I’d give it a shot. This morning I applied the balm to my inner thighs under a sundress and spent a day walking around in the heat and sunshine; it was hot, and I was sweating, but miraculously, my thighs felt fine!I applied the balm at around 11:30 am and as I write my review it’s almost 7:30 pm but my legs are going strong. Other parts of me have definitely reacted to being out and about but not my thighs - without this stuff, they would be pink and tender, but they feel soft and happy. I am absolutely impressed.Long story short, this stuff absolutely worked for me; I plan to buy a larger size when this smaller one runs out. Don’t be a doubter like I was!

  I'm fat,  I chafe, it's gross and hurts like hell.This product solves that problem.  I started walking 10 miles a day,  normally by the 5th mile I'm ready to call someone to pick me up.  Not because i'm exhausted, tired, muscles hurt.  Because my fat thighs are rubbing together trying to make fire like I'm trying out for Survivorman.  As long as I remember to put this on before my walk (applied like deodorant) I am completely chafe free.  This product is a lifesaver.

1,SPORTS,Body Glide Original Anti-Chafe Balm,$14.99,5.0,"
  I'm an avid Disney visitor. Considering Fl is basically Hell on Earth, shorts are ideal for walking in heat from 9am to 12am. In the past I've tried baby powder and deoderant for chafing, but they have never lasted more than a few hours. This body glide stuff actually lasted and I literally felt NO tenderness in my inner thighs by the end of the day. I'm talking being able to wear shorts 2 days in a row at the parks with no injury, which I haven't been able to do before! I recommend this to anyone.IMPORTANT TO NOTE THOUGH: I did put this on and immediately put on a chiffon dress after. Sadly, the grease(?) of the body glide got on the dress. I don't fully fault the product, I should have waited or been more aware, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. It hasn't gotten on other clothes so far, but some fabrics are most susceptible to those stains. Also, ""greasy"" may not be the best word. It's not like oil on your legs, but it's not exactly like dry powder deodorants.

  I really don’t get the hype!  I didn’t even think twice when purchasing this because of its amazing ratings. But I’m seeing these ratings are pretty old.  My best guess is they have changed the formula since these great reviews. Used on my thighs for those Florida days in dresses. It does NOT make your skin glide against itself. In fact it made it worse. This is a big nope from me.
"
1,SPORTS,Body Glide Original Anti-Chafe Balm,$14.99,5.0,"
   This stuff really is AWESOME. It really works and I don't know where it has been all my life. I started looking for something for thigh chafing after running into a few issues (not fun) and I read about a few options, of which Body Glide fell to the top of each list. I bought it and it was fantastic. No rubbing, no issue. And it is super easy to use, just slide it on like you'd use deodorant. I give it a few good swipes on any area that may even think about touching and I'm done. And it is light as a feather, leaves no residue (see my photo and video). It was so light that I actually thought that it would not work as I was expecting some slippery substance, but... not the case.And I have taken this Body Glide on the ULTIMATE test... a vacation to Mexico where chaffing thighs become both me and my husband's problem due to the constant wet skin and the constant walking. So we both used it on a hike in a Mexican jungle. I just knew this would fail me. I was sweating, my things were sweating, my husband was sweating. I was expecting to have the stuff just wear off from the sweat and all the walking... but NOPE! It stayed on. I even took a dip in a waterfall and it was still on to take me back to the beach. Neither one of us had any problems and my husband was equally impressed. He said we weren't ever going on a vacation again without it. lol!So I absolutely recommend this product. Try it, you will not be dissapointed!

  Ouch ouch ouch.I’m a 24-time marathon finisher and used to by this stuff by the armload. I swore by it.I had a massive stash of it so only just now had to buy the type with the newer packaging.I’m sorry for the sweaty TMI pic but I just got done with a run and I lost about 1,000 layers of skin. Are there organs showing? Bones? The very depths of my soul?I wore attire I’ve worn for hundreds of runs. The only thing that changed was the brand new container of BodyGlide and how loud I’m going to scream when the hot shower water hits my shredded skin.NOT RECOMMENDED.

  Simple and easy to use.  Comfortable.  But I agree they smell funny.  It actually smells like WD40.  And for anyone who has never heard, WD40 has been recommended by some people (even some doctors) to treat arthritic symptoms.  People swear rubbing it on knees and elbows is a miracle treatment.  I have no opinion on the subject, but can't help wondering.I washed them in a sink full of dish soap and hung to dry.  Still has a slight smell but they work and feel great!

  I have either skinny wrists or oversized hands. Either way, the difference between them is huge.This wrap would not lay right no matter how I tried to wrap it or how tight. It would warp bulging outwards or buckling inwards at certain spots. A relative with hands and wrists that were much closer to the same size did not have this problem.

  These are not what you need it you have a serious wrist issue. The are comfortable, and gives you decent wrist support without bening stiff. I mostly use them while typing.The thump part is where I have a problem. It's a set of 2, not right or left specific. Maybe because of it, the thumb hold is not supportful as possible, and gaps. Also, the holes the thumbs fit through are a little too tight to be comfortable. I hope those will resolve a  I wear them. As is, Im not sure what they are supposed to accomlish.

  Bought two of these for an extended, multi-state golf vacation.  They held up well with several flights, in and out of vehicles and some rough handling by a few aggressive caddies.  The wheels are great and very smooth, and the zippers held firm and do not stick or bind.  The material is thick and did not rip, and there's a nice thick pad at the top for additional protection of the club heads.  There is plenty of room in the bag for extra stuff too.  Even with all the protection this bag offers, my wife and I loaded our semi-soft cart bags along with a stiff arm club protector to keep the clubs from snapping if they were crushed on the ends (the one weak point in all soft-sided travel bags).  Our bags and clubs made it 14 straight days without a scratch (well, maybe a scratch from the occasional club toss).  The stitching around the handles, straps and seams is solid, and 6 months later with occasional use they still look brand new.  Well worth the money, and would recommend to anyone even if you're considering a hard case.

  I was hesitant to purchase this due to it being so inexpensive compared to others.  However, I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised this bag's durability and how well it protected my clubs.  I was a little unsure if I needed to buy one of those crutch things to put in since it has a soft top.  However, I didn't purchase one and all my clubs traveled without getting bent or mangled.  The only thing I worry about is the quality of the zippers - a little sticky already and I feel like they could get stuck or come off if you pull too hard on them.  So just a heads up - don't manhandle the zippers and this should last you for a decent amount of golf trips.No need to spend more on the ""higher quality"" bags, this one will work just fine!

  Perfect for e-scooter and golf bag. Fits my Mini Motors Speedway 3 perfect. You have to have a scooter with handlebars that fold down or that are very short width. This is great for the wheels on the bottom and moving around. Protects the scooter and my trunk / seats when transporting. It’s not padded so if using to fly with, etc I would probably bubble wrap it first. Overall great product for the price! If you need super protection you’re paying over a hundo.

  This bottle is fantastic if you plan to just have it at your desk while you work. The design looks great, and the bottle feels good in your hand. The drinking straw makes the gallon jug actually usable, and the included scrubber was a nice touch for cleaning.Now on to the negative.Not sure if I had a defective unit or what.... My jug was full and fell about 18 inches, shattering the top. This left me soaked, in a pool of water, with nothing to drink about 5 seconds after entering the gym. The jug landed on a bottom corner. See photos for shattered top and vertical crack.Plan to contact Amazon/Seller. Will update with response.

  Pandemic requires my son to bring one gallon of water to practice. Him carrying a one gallon bottle wasn’t fun nor drinking from it. So I bought this for him. He likes it.

  I bought this gallon jug to help me track my water intake. I am horrible with drinking enough water per day. I set a goal that I would try to drink at least 64 oz a day and anything additional is a bonus.

  Kind of annoying to clean by hand so sometimes I end up not using this for a few weeks until I feel like dealing with that, and I have to use a straw cleaning brush I already have to clean into the handle inside.  The dish soap does rinse out easily at least, since you can’t reach in to wipe it off.  Otherwise this is great and has helped me stay on top of my hydration.  Absolutely does not leak and having two options for the top is nice.  I have to prorate the times printed on the side to fit my schedule, so I wonder if the company would start offering them with a custom start time... 🤔

  Product was as described. No it’s not a real hydro flask straw lid, but it’s works perfectly. Hydro flask themselves didn’t even have these available when I was trying to get one, so I was nervous about ordering a knock off. This worked just fine! Doesn’t leak (which is my number one reason why I switched from those rambler cups), straw was easy to cut, and handle is so convenient - the real ones don’t have the option of the straw AND handle. It’s either or. My only wish was that the mouth piece was soft like the real ones, I’ve already hit my teeth a couple tips going to take a sip....but I’m sure it has something to do with price and patents. I would buy again if need be.

  Love love love this lid. I bought my Hydro Flask for Austin City Limits Festival last year but started using it recently to drink more water and stop wasting so many plastic bottles. While my Hydro Flask is AMAZING to keep my drinks cold the twist off top was a pain. This straw lid makes the system complete! It's easy than ever to use and in drinking water quickly. The lid is great at being leak proof given the pin/hole design (see pic) to allow air transfer when drinking but leak proof when closed. Only slight downside is cleaning requires a small extra effort, but the makes thoughtfully included an extra straw and brush to use when needed. The lid is not insulated but I'm finding the flask itself still stays remarkably cold throughout the day...If I don't drink it by the time it warms up it's time for the water to be changed anyway ;)

  just received the items, 5 minutes ago, on time for my evening jog. I opened the box and put one on. It Fits accurately as the size chart describes and I have to say the confortable, warm, and they provide a good area of coverage. I did 50 squats with it on and the sleeve does not roll ofd my legs. I'm ordering another pair.NOTE - I won't buy to use as knee pads for volleyball or mountain biking, or similar sport.

  I do recommend going one size down than you would normally wear -- the description notes are accurate. Take the time to measure around your knee for the right fit. Even a size down doesn't feel too tight.  It is a lighter-weight and breathable fabric, so it is good for wearing for extended periods of time or running/working out in warm weather.  The rubber/silicone does a nice job keeping the sleeves in place.

  When I was ready to buy a new box of bandages I didn't give it a second thought. Of course I would buy Johnson & Johnson Band-Aids just like I always have, and my parents before me, and my grandparents before them. I had tried other brands in the past in an ""emergency"" and they were next to useless so I have always stuck with the leading brand. I was ready to push the ""order"" button this time but my eye caught this product from Nexcare. Never heard of them. But I saw that they are made by 3M. Who in the world knows more about adhesives (Scotch tape, Post-it Notes, etc) than 3M? So I figured what could it hurt and changed my order to a box of 100 assorted bandages in the most common sizes.I'm impressed. Unlike everyone else who simply tried to copy Band-Aid, Nexcare pretty much reinvented the bandage. To begin with, it's not the typical shape but more of a diamond shape with rounded corners. The corners don't catch on clothing and other things like the squared-off edges of other bandages and the diamond shape is far more forgiving around areas that aren't flat like knuckles, wrists, toes, etc (doesn't it seem that bandages are never needed on flat, smooth expanses of skin?)There's another major difference as well. Most bandages leave a gap along the sides where water and other stuff can get to the wound. Nexcare surrounds the entire wound and seals in in against water and foreign objects, yet the material breathes and allows healing air to penetrate. Leave it to 3M to come up with that magic.  One independent study showed that Nexcare leaked about 25 percent of the time while Band-Aid about 40 percent of the time, compared with more than 85 percent for lower-rated products.I can't count how often I've been disappointed by so-called waterproof bandages that peel off as soon as they get wet. Not so with the Nexcare product, it really sticks like glue but yet is ouchless when peeled off, even on hairy arms and legs. Another plus is that they do NOT contain latex.Bandages are something no one wears by choice and frankly this box of 100 will probably last me for years, so 3M isn't going to get rich off me.  They are priced competitively but it doesn’t hurt that Amazon often has them on sale.Are they perfect?  I can’t find any major faults with the bandages themselves but I do have one suggestion which is rather than toss all of the three sizes into the box randomly it would be nice if they put some sort of cardboard dividers to separate the sizes to make them easier to find when you don’t have a lot of time to fuss around looking for a bandage.I know this review is pretty enthusiastic about something as basic as a bandage but I do like these and now that I've tried them I think they're a big improvement from what I've been using till now.

  Ok, so I may be a bit paranoid or perhaps that I just know my family's propensity to get cuts/scrapes/injuries, but I like to have a well stocked medkit in each of our vehicles as well as a primary medkit in the house.Just before our last summer camping trip I decided that we were running a bit low on bandaids, particularly waterproof ones. Previously we'd had a similar product and really loved them, but I couldn't find the exact ones so I did my usual search on Amazon and found these.After having used them on the camping trip I'm really kind of sad....because now I need to buy several more boxes of them to replace all the other bandaids I had previously stocked. Yes, they are that good.Let me go into the specifics of why they worked awesome for us. First, there are the little tiny bandaids (22mmx26mm) which I thought were going to be somewhat useless due to their small size, but they were actually the first to win me over. My 2yr old would get bugbites (no matter how consistently bugspray was applied), and then she would scratch the bites till they bled, and she would do the same for the scabs as soon as they would form. These little bandaids were ideal for keeping her sores clean and protecting them from her little fingernails.The medium size ones worked great at covering some small cuts and scrapes on my sons hands and elbows after he lost a duel with a pine tree (amazingly, they actually stayed on him for a couple days).The large ones are big enough for moderate cuts, but still a bit too small for a normal skinned knee or elbow. I am currently using one of them to cover up an area on my knee that has a couple stitches and needs to be kept dry. It works, but I think I'll try and pick up some bigger ones to keep on hand.My final comment is regarding the individual packaging on each bandage. This type of clear bandage is very thin and floppy and on the previous version it took some effort to get the bandaid placed without getting it stuck to itself since it is almost like trying to put on a piece of saranwrap. This version has solved that problem by having a thin piece of stiffer plastic attached to the outer surface of the bandage that helps it retain its shape as you place it over the wound. After you've got the bandage stuck down, that thin bit of plastic is pulled off and you're left with a clear, unobtrusive patch that is tough, flexible, and has made an ideal waterproof barrier around the wound.Yea....as I'm writing this, I've finished convincing myself to go ahead and just upgrade all my medkits to these bandaids.

  Apply to clean and completely dry skin, press down all around edges, don’t take the paper strips off right away ... leave for at least 30 seconds before removing.  Gives the adhesive time to adhere well to skin.Be careful when removing from package and applying not to let any wrinkles form.If applied properly, this bandage becomes like a second skin, and will not come off until you peel it off, days later even. I have one on my thumb that is still sealed after hand wahings, dishes, showers.This may seem like a lot of work just to use a bandage, but worth it.  You may need to replace a different type of bandage 10 times to this one if on hands.  I get thumb splits in the winter that are painful if exposed, get wet, get bumped.  These bandages help so much!

  I don't know where these came from, but they are so dried out they have to be way outdated.  Everytime I try to unwrap, they either curl or wnot stick. Should have sent them back. I called Nexcare, but they couldn't give me any information on manufacturing date. I'd like to know when I'm getting something from an Amazon supplier, before I order. Will buy at drugstore next time.

  Cannot get it on because when taking off the back tape it comes off partially. Then it gets stuck together and can't seal straight.It crumples up and cannot be applied.I have used these before with great success. I think these are very old...

  Worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon; product should be taken off the market.  I am not a weak person but I could not take apart the hoop sections at all, no matter how hard I pressed on the button spot.  Also, two of the segments were damaged and could not even be put together; now i cannot even return it since I cannot get it apart.  This is a  horrendously bad product.

  This was such a good purchase! I wanted a way to get exercise at home that was also something I would enjoy, and I heard that hula hooping could be a good waist trainer, so I thought a weighted one was a good idea. Assembly is very easy, the only thing is I personally have to move the foam exterior to press the buttons when I'm taking it apart, which isn't really that big of a deal. I ended up cutting my nails because when you're starting out trying to learn to hula hoop and you have to constantly grab and re-spin the hoop, it is very easy to stick long nails into the foam and damage it. With practice I was able to improve my hooping skills in one day, but I highly recommend starting out slow, because I hooped for 60 minutes one night and my hip was pretty bruised, which is completely on me. I love the option to adjust the size, because some people need more room and some don't have as much.  I can't say how effective it is exercise-wise since I really just started, but I'll make sure to update- so far I think it's worth it!

  I’ve worn thru a lot of hats and glad to have finally landed on this one.  A mesh area lets air circulate to give the hat a cooler feel than others I’ve owned.  A drawstring can be pulled under the chin if the wind picks up--- happens all the time where I live.  The brim is a little wider than most of the hats I’ve worn, definitely a plus.  With this hat and a few dabs of sunscreen, I feel I’m pretty well protected from the damaging rays of the Sun.  Happy purchase!

  I have a size 7 head. Had to sinch the drawstring in the back as tight as it would go. I don't have eyes in the back of my head, but I'm pretty sure that looks a little weird from the back. It's still a little big but manageable. I like the look and the coverage, and the material appears to breathe well, especially with the vents going all the way around the hat. It looks pretty good. Upon receipt, I was able to sign up for a lifetime warranty on the hat. I hope that doesn't consist of me being spam mailed to death. I hope I don't have to return it anytime soon. It appears to be made well enough to last a while. If you treat your equipment well it will take care of you. This hat is no different.

  This hat, actually hats, were a hit! I bought one for my cardiologist who is retiring in 2 weeks plus got me one also to putter around in the back yard feeding birds, watering, etc. I had my last appointment today with my DR and presented him with this hat because I heard he loves fishing so I figured this would be perfect out fishing or on a boat, etc. He was so happy with this. He actually put it on and told me about his last fave hat he had 15 years and then one day a gust of wind blew it off because he goes out on the ocean fishing sometimes. Anyways, I told him not anymore, showed him the chin strap and how easy it is to use. Showed him the ventilation mesh on top to help cool, he really loved that, and showed him the 2 snaps on each side at the top of the hat, told him he can look Australian then mate ;-). So, this hat was just perfect and a great bargain for the price. So, Dr loves his hat, plus the fishing shirt I got him, plus retirement cup for his coffee with a witty saying, plus his lures and sinkers and antler desk top clock I got him. lol. Great present. Love my hat. Thanks. Great deal. I will be buying more, my ex saw mine and liked it :-)

  As a person who has had multiple procedures done as a result of basal cell carcinoma,(skin cancer) I am very careful to wear protective clothing whenever I am going to be exposed to the sun.  I had lost the hat that I used for several years and I had to replace it, so after reading the reviews from people who had purchased this hat, I decided to give it a try.  The hat is prefect!!  It is very light weight and extremely comfortable in addition to providing the sun protection I need.  Thank you for a product that covers all the bases I need covered!!

  ""Delivery was fast. Hat was delivered flattened but not folded. I expected it to be a crunched up bundle. Pleasantly pleased. Size adjustment was at its max when delivered. Fits just right. Haven't tested for its water shedding but love the look, wide brim and I can still carry my bug net and neck gaiter when I snap up the sides of the brim. Great price.""update:Purchased 2nd hat for family member and found that the size adjustment to make it smaller doesn't stay tight. Difficult to grasp in your fingers to adjust . When you set the size the  clasp will not hold the line securely....line too narrow??  Does not function. A barrel lock w/good spring is needed..thicker line....or even the two holed leather pulls that are on some chin straps would be better. Really not adjustable as is...too bad.

  Bought these as a replacement to my girlfriends rubber resistance bands that we thought she lost (was found later). My girlfriend had already gone to the highest level of resistance with the rubber ones and was now doubling up on them to get the resistance she needed. But I noticed how often it’s roll around and ride up her leg and how she’d paid to fix it constantly . THESE ARE PERFECT. She used the “light” weight option and said it was as tough as the toughest one of the rubbers! Plus with all the booty workouts she does she moves ALOT and I have not once seen these ride up her leg or roll up on her at allEven though she did find the old bands since having these she has not touched them once and only sticks to these new ones instead.Kudos on a well made product all the way around!(They even look amazing!)

  When the gyms closed due to Covid-19, I had to up my home gym. Bands are an easy and inexpensive way to workout at home. The bands are very high quality and having three different strengths to work with is awesome.

Adding bands makes any movement more challenging.

  Great bands. Only one random complaint: the rubber part on the inside of the bands gave me a weird rash on the back of my thigh after a recent use (pictured). I’ve used them on my bare legs before and haven’t had this problem until now, but I’m definitely positive that it was from the band as I felt the chafing and pain in the area while using it. I’ll probably just use them while wearing workout pants from here on out to avoid this.

  These are some tough workout bands. They feel much stronger than the rubber resistance bands that I’m used to. Since these are made out of cloth they feel a lot better when they are rubbing against my skin when I use them. The rubber bands that I use to use always felt a little abrasive on my skin. I use these bands mainly to work on my quads and hamstrings at the gym. They are a supplement to my workout routine. These set of bands also come with a bag and its so portable, I feel like I can carry it in my pockets if I had to.

  UPDATE!!!  February 18, 2019I reviewed these arthritis gloves a couple of months ago, and I feel that an update would be necessary. I think my review underestimated the gloves and that’s why I want to clarify. These are the best arthritis gloves around! After trying numerous different brands I can confidently tell you that this one is a definite winner!! It’s super soft and comfortable for all day wear. I wear it to work and it doesn’t interfere with my typing and paperwork at all.These gloves provide me with the perfect compression in my fingers so I finally have some pain relief when I wear them. I was so excited with this find, I make sure to share this big secret with all my family, friends, and acquaintances that might benefit from it. My cousin doesn’t stop thanking me, she says these gloves changed her whole life. I totally believe her.The quality is top grade. I am constantly washing it and drying it, and by just looking at the gloves you would think it’s brand new. I am going to place an order right now for an additional pair so I can switch off between the two at night.I recommend these highly and I will continue to do so. I hope with this I can bring relief to soo many people that are desperately looking for it.Don’t hesitate! Buy your pair right now!!!

  These arthritis gloves saved me. After looking for solutions for almost a dozen of years, I can’t believe it took me this long to get these.I have been suffering from arthritis for almost 20 years now. In the beginning it was just a little soreness in my fingers and my knees, but with time the symptoms increased and multiplied by leaps and bounds. I began experiencing intermittent pain in the joints, ankle, back, fingers, hands, muscles, neck, and wrist. The pain in the fingers and hands were the worst. They really impacted my day to day life more than anything else.I was becoming handicapped. It was horrible to become so dependent on others at such a young age. In my younger years I have been a court stenographer. As soon as the arthritis symptoms appeared I was forced to give it up. I tried other small jobs over the years, but arthritis ripped me away from the occupation that suited me most.My Dr. referred me to a Rheumatologist who suggested the following:* Hydrotherapy* Stretching* Massages* AcupunctureAnd many more diverse ideas. Some were more soothing and some were less, but that’s all they were. Soothing. During the hydrotherapy I blessed the instructor.i haven’t felt so good in years! But that relief was short lived, as it only lasted for a short while, and later that day I was back to square one.My wife and 3 children were all very worried about me. They didn’t stop suggesting different remedies they have head about:* physical exercise * Weight loss* Heating pad* Ice packs* Cold compressesAnd I tried. I really did. I went through each of them. When it didn’t work I gave it another chance and another chance. I was sooo desperate! I am big believer of natural, and therefore I didn’t try any medications. I don’t believe any of them would have helped anyways!I was beginning to give up hope. I thought I was done for life, since any daily chore became so difficult. I didn’t like depending on others and being a burden on them.Then a miracle happened. My daughter bought me a pair of ComfyBrace arthritis gloves as a gift for Christmas. I was really skeptical. After nothing helped, why would this be different? Well, you gotta believe it. I was so desperate that I was willing to try anything, and try it I did. It only took a few hours for the gloves to begin their magic. The size large fits me comfortably. (How did my sweet daughter know exactly what size to get? God bless her!) It has the perfect balance. The compression is great, but it’s not painful. I wouldn’t say it happened over night, but in a very short time I was doing things again that were very difficult for me a mere 2 days ago. I did not become young again, and I will not be a court stenographer ever again, butat least I got my independence back. I am still looking for a solution to all the other pains, perhaps someone has a solution for that??I ordered another pair, so I can wear it when the other one is in the wash. I couldn’t wait until it dries to put it back on, a second pair was crucial.So far I have been highly satisfied, and I’m extremely thankful for this amazing creation.I have been wearing it for only a couple of weeks now, I will definitely update my review in a few weeks to let you know how it has been going!I highly recommend that everyone tries this! Nothing like it....

As far as we can tell, the sizes are the same except the medium has longer fingers, we decided we will keep both for our individual needs. They are not tight around the wrist, just the knuckles and fingers, She's been wearing hers at night with arnica gel and I wear mine while I'm crocheting with a peppermint/eucalyptus liquid, we both feel they are helping so we will order again!!

  MY HANDS HAVE ACHED AND SWELLED UP FREQUENTLY OVER THE LAST YEAR. I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CARPAL TUNNEL AND ARTHRITIS AND STRONGLY SUSPECT TENDONITIS AS WELL. THE DAY THESE ARRIVED MY HAND HAD SWOLLEN UP AND WAS ACHING AND BURNING. IMMEDIATELY I COULD FEEL RELIEF FROM THE SLIGHT PRESSURE OF THE GLOVE. I ACTUALLY SLEPT WITH BOTH OF THEM ON THE FIRST NIGHT. THERE WERE NO RUB MARKS FROM THE SEAMS. THE WRIST AREA AND FINGERTIPS ARE JUST LOOSE ENOUGH TO NOT CUT OFF CIRCULATION. THE FABRIC IS VERY BREATHABLE, THE SEAMS APPEAR STRONG AND DON'T CAUSE ANY FRICTION AND THE MOISTURE WICKING FABRIC IS HIGH QUALITY.. AS FAR AS THE SIZE:  I MEASURED AT EXACTLY 3.5 INCHES ACROSS MY KNUCKLES AND THE MEDIUMS FIT PERFECTLY..I'M VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH THESE..

  I bought this product in June 2018 for severe pain and stiffness in my hands. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. These gloves are absoulutely fantastic! I bought the size small. They fit nicely, just enough compression, but not uncomfortable at all. They are very durable, as well. I've washed them multiple times and they still hold up like day 1. No stitching has come loose, the fabric doesn't pill and they don't make your hands sweat like crazy if you want to do chores or be out side when it's warm outside.I'm extremely happy that I bought these! I really cannot stress enough how much these helped me. When the pain is severe in my hands, I litereally can't move my fingers. AT ALL. Usually after wearing the gloves for the first part of the day I can  clench my right hand, and partially the left and the pain is WAY WAY less than if I had not had them on.

  So I'm fat. Like, 270+ pounds of thighs and meat. My thighs rub together like nobody's business. Like, as soon as they start touching I'm in pain/ bumps form/ my skin starts burning off. This saved my f****ng life. I went on vacation in vt and did some hiking with a dress (because fashion/wanted to try this stuff out) and was BLOWN AWAY. There is ZERO greasiness. It goes on like lotion. Apply generously, massage into problem areas and GO. It feels like there is nothing there. I was genuinely shocked by how amazing it was. Went swimming in a lake, got out and did some more walking. Still zero pain. Zero bumps. ZERO irritation. Summer has never been so easy. I don't leave my home without it. 10/10 would recommend.

  Ok so I was a little skeptical at first. As I greased up my nuts, I felt like this has got to be a mistake, I thought for sure that I was gonna squish around like two sumos covered in crisco oil! Boy was I wrong! The greasiness subsides almost immediately. It left my nether regions free from friction all day. This product test was done in June in Orlando, during the rainy season, at Disney world.  The temps were in the 90s, humidity was at 100% most of the day.

  I should have looked more closely at the ingredients, but this product has lanolin in it which is derived from the wool industry. Lot of people think sheep just live happily on a farm and get shorn from time to time, but look up some videos online, it's horrific the torment those animals go through. I did some more research and it seems Enzo's Buttonhole is the best choice and it works very well and it's vegan and well priced and highly recommended by lots of people.

  I read the rave reviews for this product and I was trying to use it instead of RunGoo,which works extremely well but will stain white shirts.  I use anti chaff products for my mid to long runs (6 miles to 13 miles).  Opened up the tube and the first thing I noticed was how thin and runny this cream was and that should have been a warning. Both RunGoo and Glide are thick paste or waxy products that protect.  Bottom line I went on an 8 mile run in 77F temperatures on a humid morning and I was very tender afterwards. Had I run 12 miles I surely would have bled through my shirt.  Basically this stuff is only good for very light chaffing, and won't work for runners.I am really getting disillusioned by the positive reviews on Amazon on many products.

  After years of a pretty sedentary lifestyle, I started getting into biking this past April.  Since May I have purchased 2 bikes and I am riding several times per week.  The two most important things for my comfort are a good pair of cycling shorts / bibs with a high quality chamois (see my other reviews for recommendations) and chamois cream.  The Chamois Butt’r Cream is my favorite.  It is affordable, non-greasy, non staining and odorless.  But most importantly, IT WORKS!!  My longest ride to date was 100 miles but with good cycling shorts and Chamois Butt’r cream, I did not have any chaffing or skin / friction problems even on an all day ride.To paraphrase the Old AmEx commercial, “Don’t leave home on your bike without it.”

  *****VERY IMPORTANT NOTE*****This is not a replacement for Vaseline or body glide!  What do I mean?I have been using chamois butt'r for about 4 years now, and it works great.  The only complaint I have had is that the pricing seems to be out of control... this stuff has become super expensive over the last several years.  But it really does help on the long rides.So I hadbeen training for Ironman Cozumel 2015 (first one) and I decided that I would throw small packets of chamois butt'r into my transition bags as a quick fix for chaffing... HUGE MISTAKE!  I did this because when you are wet, body glide doesn't really go on easily, and i had never trained with vaseline...which is what a lot of people were using.  If you could have seen my face after i applied the chamois butt'r to my already semi-chaffed areas (under my arms, and my inner thighs), you would have thought i was re-enacting the Home Alone scene where Macaulay Culkin slaps after shave on his face.  My eyes widen, my ""O"" face came out, but I was able to hold the scream in.  It took a second for the burn to kick in... and took several mins for it to go away.  I finished the race, but i will never use chamois butt'r for anything other than on my chamois....

  Oh man the praise i have for this stuff, I'll even overlook the smell just because it works so well. My butt cheeks have never been happier since i started using this magic lotion. Before this, i could start a fire with the friction going on between my thighs. If you're active and you're definitely lacking in the ""thigh-gap"" department, i highly recommend this stuff. Its amazing. I personally don't dig the smell but life without chaffing is totally worth dealing with the smell

  I started doing endurance rides and got this just to see what it was like, and bought it rather sheepishly.PROS:Delivers out of the squeezed tube in a very controllable way.Spreads on easily.Does what it says it does:  prevents chaffing on long rides (I've only done up to 4 hours so far, but no problem.)Love the coconut smell.  After a long ride, your nasty bib smells like a new beach toy, haha.CONS:Seems a bit expensiveGotta say, I'm impressed.  I don't chaffe bad at all on 2 hour rides, but I've noticed a difference with vs without.  Heck, I'd buy it JUST for the better smelling soiled bib!

  Remember growing up you had to take several of these to the face on the playground to prove you were a challenger?  I do.  These balls are perfect for mixing it up in the playground and teaching kids to be tough again.  Just remind them that there's no crying after you get hit.

  If you are interested in buying this ball for kick ball or dodge ball, buy it.  Do not pay any attention to the the one star reviews.  I bet that every ball that has failed has been over inflated.  It says right on the ball, ""Inflate to 1.5 lbs. of air pressure.  I used a digital air pump to inflate.  It doesn't take much air at 1.5 pounds.  I've played several kick ball games with family, friends and neighbors, adults and kids, the ball has held up with zero problems.  Most people who have touched the ball says it needs air but it doesn't.  It's keeps it's shape while still being soft.  It's easy to grip, it doesn't hurt when you are hit with it and the adults can't kick it a mile because it gives so much at 1.5 pounds of air pressure.  I have never left it outside in the sun and wouldn't recommend it.  I can't remember anything made of rubber lasting when left out in the elements.

  Ok - this is the only brand worth purchasing based on our experience.  The rubber is good quality.  We've had great luck with this brand.  All the other brands had low quality rubber that ruptured within weeks.  We have about 3 of them and so far none of them show signs of ware.Most people are using this ball wrong and they are WAY over inflating it.  1.5 pounds is hardly anything.  You should be able to squish it down easily.  If it says it's a P1000K then it is 100% the 10"" ball that most people are inflating all the way to 12"" inches +.  Then they wonder why they rupture.  Of course, if it lands on a sharp stick it will break i'm sure.  Hasn't happened to us, but these are not basketballs or soccer balls.  The very concept of a kickball ball makes it be somewhat vulnerable.  It's not the brand, it's the type of ball you are using.  This is a RUBBER ball.  Understand rubber.  Anything stronger and you would not have a kickball.TIPS:1) P1000K should be about 10"" when properly inflated.  If you don't have a gauge that is ultra sensitive, then get a tape measure and estimate.2) They are not meant to take direct sunlight for prolonged time.  That is, don't leave them laying exposed in the sunlight when not in use.  I doubt the rubber is UV stable.3) Deflate them in the winter when not in use.  Rubber warps when cold as it tries to shrink, but, because of pressure, can't.4) Try to avoid sharp objects in the field (this goes without saying, but, reading reviews, maybe not)We use these every week at our compound and they are great.  So much fun.  Don't forget to warm up a little :)Life is good!

  I purchased a kit through Amazon to inflate the ball that included a pressure gage, etc.  I did NOT over inflate the ball. I do long distance bicycling; I'm familiar with inflating tires, etc.5 days after inflating the ball, it exploded.  The ball had never been used, it was sitting on my sofa.  I was planning to play kick ball for the first time with my Grandson that coming weekend.My wife threw it out, or I would have returned it for a refund.

  My kids and I love playing kickball with the nieces, nephews, cousins, etc., and we play whenever we can.  These balls rock.  The adult size is markedly larger, and took some adjustments in our game since we previously apparently bought the kids size, but having the larger sized ball makes the game a little more competitive because the adults can't just blow it out of the park anymore.  Very bouncy, sturdy (have taken direct hits off the top of the chain-link fence around the park we play in with no issues) and inflate easily.  My go-to kickball for sure.

  Great quality,  holds air good and the rubber seems well made.It’s a solid kickball, but where it really shines is as a dodgeball. We were playing with my son, and my nieces and nephews, originally with one of those foamy dodgeballs. Then I asked the kids if they wanted to play, “old style”, unwittingly but enthusiastically they collective gave a big, “Hell Yeah!”Now this ball is bigger than a dodgeball, even seems bigger than the old kickballs, so it made it tough to grip when it was full of air. I Tom Bradyied that sucker and let a bit of air out, just enough so I could grip it but the kids couldn’t, because life is full of lessons, and “trust no one” is a good one.The grip ridges are perfect, as they allowed me to really get some spin on it, leading to devastating results, they also made really cool imprinted tattoos when you caught them good in an area of bare skin. The accuracy was excellent, as I only had one throw get away from me, drilling my niece in the ear, and taking her off her feet, but she bounced well, and stayed in the game. I really didn’t dial it up much on the small kids, under 50;pounds, as the size of the ball alone, coupled with the uncontrolled laughter/screaming, was enough to easily take them down with well placed body shots.All in all I was really proud of the kids abilities to take a shot, and subsequent fall, as no one got hurt (other than a minor injury to my throwing shoulder, but the Doc says I should heal up in no time after the surgery) everyone had fun and they have stories to tell for years.

  If I could give these goggles 0 stars, I would.  My daughter is a 6 day a week swimmer and had owned 8 pairs of these over the past 2 years.  She loves how they feel in the water, which is why we continud to repurchase.  However every pair broke in exactly the same way at the nosepiece.  She has gone thru 3 pairs in the past 3 months.  I attempted to contact Speedo directly about this potential product design flaw, but their response was disinterested at best.  We will be a Tyr family from here on out.

  Both of my sons are swimmers and they have been pretty fond of the Speedo Vanquisher 2.0 for the past few years (I've probably bought 10 pairs by now) but this last pair broke about 10 minutes into practice.  The plastic where the nose piece connects to the goggle just snapped and broke completely leaving them absolutely useless.  My son was pretty mad because he had to finish the next 90 minutes with no goggles.  I was not able to return them for some reason but after explaining what happened Amazon issued me a full refund.  3 stars for Speedo and 5 stars for Amazon.

  These are absolutely 5 star quality... Up until 2 years ago, I was a competitive swimmer at a division 3 collegiate level with 16 years of racing under my belt. I have tried most goggles out there like the Swedes and the TYR version but have always made it back to the vanquisher. They are the best for cost, aerodynamics, and feel. For everyone complaining about being too dark, I'm not sure what you're looking for, these are goggles, not corrective lenses. The black line on the bottom of the pool isn't that hard to see. Also, if I had wanted my competition to see my eyes, I would have gotten clear goggles. FYI, no competitive swimmer wears clear goggles.

  Well I normally wear a speed socket model goggle for racing, these goggles are much more padded around the eye socket and are comfortable for longer swims without rubbing your eyes as much. The only compromise there is that they don't adhere to your face quite as well on a entry or start dive. After more than 2,000 hours in the pool, these goggles are still holding up great! Making sure to dry them off and keep him in there and they gobble pouch will further prolong your life as it prevents any dry rotted deterioration of the gasket.

1,SPORTS,Speedo Unisex-Adult Swim Goggles Mirrored Vanquisher 2.0,$19.50,3.0,"
  As a lifelong swimmer, and earnest competitor for many years, I've used myriad performance-oriented goggles. These are my all-time favorite. They're as comfortable as any goggles can be, the silicone seals and straps are durable and effective, and they're low-profile / streamlined so they stay on during dives and fast turns. Additionally, they come in a variety of tints/finishes, so you can get a pair that will work indoor, outdoor, or both. I'm on my third pair.My only complaint is that the inside coating has a tendency to peel off quickly, which effectively ruins the goggles.I'm not talking about the supposedly ""anti-fog"" lenses fogging up - you've got moist eyes, sweat, occasional leaks, and a temperature differential between the air in the goggles and the water outside them. You're going to get fog, eventually, in any goggles. These are no exception.Rather, the film on the inside of the goggles actually peels off, no matter how carefully I baby them. I follow the instructions to never touch the inside surface with my hands, and to rinse with cool tap water after each use. I've tried keeping them in the original blister pack, as well as in a microfiber bag for sunglasses. They always, always peel - and early in their lifespan.I don't want to generate a mound of plastic trash, so I keep using the goggles for years after they've started to peel, until the degraded visibility becomes a functional problem, rather than just an annoyance. That's a testament to how much I like the fit/performance otherwise. Personally, I'd rather have a plain-old plastic lens that fogs up, than these ones with their garbage inner coating that peels raggedly - and then fogs anyway.Regarding fit, the snap-in nose piece works well - once installed, it does it's job reliably for years, without having to touch it again. If you've ever spent an entire afternoon trying to tie the thread on your Swedish goggles exactly right, you'll appreciate this simple and sturdy design from Speedo. If you have to change the size to get the right initial fit, however, it takes a surprising amount of muscle and finesse to remove the stock nose piece. I can't believe that I haven't snapped the goggles when doing this, but so far I'm three-for-three in successfully swapping the nose piece for a different size.Lastly, I just bought a pair of silver mirrored ones, and find that they're dark - really dark. I didn't realize that the lenses were tinted dark gray in addition to the mirrored coating. They're probably great for outdoor swimming, but are not appropriate for indoors, IMO. I'll definitely be going back to clear, non-mirrored lenses when these ones wear out. This doesn't affect my star rating, it's just an FYI, because I didn't understand this from the product page.To Speedo - please fix or remove the awful coating in these goggles. Otherwise, don't change a thing.

  Bought 3 of these for my grandchildren for competition. First meet, two of them broke by the nose strap area. We are left with 1 unused one. Of course, my poor grandchild (See actual event photo) lost that race. We could not return to Amazon because we sent these goggles internationally hoping to depend on a Speedo brand. Reached out to Speedo hoping for a resolution but said, since Amazon is not an authorized seller, that they cannot do anything.  What a waste of time, effort, and money. Horrible experience!!

  Update: 2/27/18:  After about 6 uses, I am seeing some indents where my feet and hands normally are placed.  Not sure if this is premature wearing or not.  Also, it seems this company generates a lot of reviews by offering free samples for giving a review of 100 words or more on their product.  I received a pamphlet with my mat on their warranty and review process, posted a review, and then they sent me an e-mail ""gift claim form"" where I can basically get something for free from them since I provided a review.I purchased this for yoga, based on all the reviews this item has, and so far I've used it 3 times over the past week.  It's worked great so far, and here are my thoughts based on other reviews:1) Squeakiness/noise:  Yes, it does make some noise as I move into different poses.  I do yoga at home, so it doesn't bug me, but I could see it being a problem in a yoga studio or in a group of people.  It doesn't constantly squeak, but as I move my feet around, it does make some noise.  I think it's more the mat and the wooden floor it's on which creates the noise.2) Falling apart: Some reviews mentioned it immediately starts to disintegrate.  I have noticed a couple of strands of rubber come off as I unroll it, but it doesn't seem that bad at all.  I'll update this if it continues to come apart as other reviews had indicated.3) Smell: It smells a little bit, kind of like a latex pillow or other similar rubber/plastic product.  I only noticed it today when I had my face down on it, so it's not strong at all.4) Movement:  I haven't noticed it moving around at all.  It sticks to my wooden floor pretty well, so no complaints there.5) Squishiness: Some people have said it's too thick and they sink into the mat.  I haven't noticed this at all.  Prior to this mat, I was using a thin yoga mat and any time I was on my hands or knees for a long time it was very uncomfortable.  This mat still allows me to do the poses, but much more comfortably than before.

  Came in on time, class tomorrow. I unrolled it and I'm so glad I got the 1/2 inch thickness it feels great on my feet. The mat is very long too which is nice. I love purple so yay on the color. Love the carrying strap, makes it so easy to contain and carry. Can't wait to go to class tomorrow!! There was a small abnormality in the foam but it doesn't go all the through and is no issue at all, you can see in pic it's about the size of the tip of my pinky finger and does effect use of the mat at all.Update: down to 2 stars. The mat is comfy but it's not good. After two uses the rubber looks likes it's starting to break down. The mat moves a lot during a session and squeeks which is annoying and embarrassing. Returned

  I should have listened to the other reviewers!  I bought this mat because I wanted to have less pain while doing exercises like modified pushups or yoga poses that involve contact with my back/knees.  The mat is certainly thick and helped to reduce the amount of pain I felt in my knees and back bones.  HOWEVER, after only a few uses the mat started to tear on its surface.  Moreover, this mat slips really badly!  I have laminate wood floors; however, I also have two other yoga mats in the house and they do NOT slip.

  This mat did not hold up well at all. I do yoga 3X a week and wanted something heavier/thicker for knee support. After a few weeks, it curled up, there are tears along the sides, and it is basically unusable. Return window closes after 30 days but I did not start using it until mid-January so it's been less than a month and I am stuck with it. Will not buy from this company - can't even each anyone at customer link (which was provided by Amazon).

  This was my first yoga mat that I purchased.  $10, what a steal, right?  I have laminate floors and I could not do any routines without slipping and stretching the mat all over the place.  I didn't realize how much harder and undesirable a routine could be when you had the extra distraction of a stretchy, slippery mat.  I also thought that thicker would be more comfortable, but I am actually going to try a standard 1/4 inch mat instead of this one because it almost seems too thick.  The only redeeming quality was that I did not experience any tears like other customers, but with the amount of stretching, I could definitely see it happening.  I used this maybe 4 or 5 times but I want to move on to something else at this point.

  I just received this in the mail, and I knew immediately I would like it.  It is incredibly cushioned, which for me is of major importance.  I have bad knees, and regular mats are never cushioned enough for me.  I bruise easily, but this seems like it will prevent any sort of bruising or soreness on my knees or hips.  I don't really do any impact type exercise, so I cannot give a review to it on that.  I do however do Piyo daily, as well as a few other body weight resistance and strengthening exercises, and this has an awesome grip.  No more sliding or falling due to instability issues caused by no traction.  I look forward to being able to do the exercises without fear of a few routines again!  On a side note, I haven't noticed any odd or offensive smells, so that's a bonus!  I am actually considering ordering a second mat for my husband!  He is 6'3, and this seems like it is long enough, and soft enough for his back injury, for him to use as well

  ok, this is the first yoga mat I've ever purchased, so I don't have others to compare it too.  First off, I'm not an avid yoga practitioner--I just wanted something with enough cushioning to pad my bones on a hard floor.  This def'ly does that--it is very cushiony and soft.  one side is completely smooth and the other is slightly corrugated.  I assumed smooth was for the down side, and used it that way.  Had no problems with slipping at all.  I see that others have had issues with tears.  I can see where that could happen--the foam is very soft.  It is in fact softer, that I expected for something labeled high density.  However, since every other pad I saw in stores was only a 1/4"" thick for the same price,  I am very happy with it so far.Edit--I should have added, you'll need to be sure your floor and shoes are clear of any grit--the foam is soft enough that any odd bits of stuff are going to imbed into it.

  This review is for the KEVENZ 50-Pack KEVENZ 3-Star 40mm White Table Tennis Balls,Advanced tournament Ping Pong Balls (Tournament ping-pong Ball).I started off not looking to buy 50 but when you look at the price compared to buying a smaller number it just made more sense.  The balls bounce true and work as expected.  All 50 balls came shipped in a box that is now doubling at the storage bin.  None were damaged on arrival.  We keep it the storage bin next to the ping pong table and when a ball goes flying out of play or gets lost the kids just reach and grab a new one.  Once a week or so I go and pick up all the ""lost"" ones and put them back in the storage bin.  .I'm the type who does a lot of review and comparison before making a purchase.If you found my review helpful please like it.

  Have a slightly tackier feel to them than the more expensive big brand balls. The weight and size is on par...the balls bounce well. So if you are OK with the tackier feel (better spin because of grip, if you ask me) than that of the smoother balls, get these. What a great deal. 5/5

  Great table tennis balls. My only regret is not getting the 100 pack. We use these for our home table and our family has some table tennis players who take their game and trash talking very seriously. If you are in that sort of environment (family, frat house, etc) with very serious and competitive types, you can't go wrong with these.

  I had bought this brand before from Amazon and thought it would be the same, but this item was cheaper and not the same quality as the one I got last time. Seems flimsy and doesn't have the same bounce. See images for comparison.. the one on the left is the more recent purchase, the one on the right is the older purchase (ITTF approved).

  They're table tennis balls.  They're bright, round, and durable, unlike some balls that crack easily.  The green print on the balls makes is easier for me to track spin than the black print on another brand of orange balls I own, so that's a plus.These balls are perfect for a recreation-level table tennis player like me.

  You can never have too many ping pong balls. And if you play table tennis with kids, you can double that advice. These are solid balls that bounce and spin well. They have a crisp feel off the paddle, and ping smartly off of the table. They also stand up to wicked spikes and hard forehand slams.I’m an amateur player, and I like these balls. At .20 cents each, they are a decent value for a 40mm ball. You can keep the game moving without having to constantly retrieve balls. For 10 bucks, it’s a good buy for 50 balls.

  This is a good pack of balls..  Round, orange, smooth, bouncy, and consistent.  I don't have much to compare it to and I'm just a novice player but they work fine for me and the guys at work.  We lose a lot of balls so a 50 pack was perfect.

  What a great price for these balls.  Around $.20 a piece, which is probably 5-10 times cheaper than buying a pack of 3 at a random store.  The balls themselves are a good color orange, are spherically symmetrical (you'd think that should be a given, but those cheaper balls are not very spherical, especially 1-star balls), and are a good hardness to give some weight to your games.  After several games of smashing the balls you might crack them, but they last a long time.  Will buy these again if I ever end up breaking them all.

  I scoured Amazon and the internet for simple and easy-to-read watches, looking for certain features and reading reviews, which takes more time than one would like to calculate. If you want watches with bells and whistles there are millions. If you want a watch that someone with low vision and/or memory problems/dementia can read, not so many. It’s sad when you get right down to it, but I expect it’s because those not needing exotic interfaces just use their cell phone to check the time.Dad’s watch broke, so I needed to replace it. He’s 87 with diminishing eyesight, memory problems, ad encroaching dementia.  Dad has 4 or 5 clocks in his room, but can’t handle not having a watch on top of all the clocks and an over-sized timer that can break your eardrums. (When we moved him out of his house, he had so many clocks it wasn’t funny, often more than one on a surface.)All I wanted was a clearly readable time, plus the date and day of the week in a hopefully reliable watch. I narrowed my search down to three watches that varied in cost from $13 to $70. We leaned toward digital because I read that as their memory got worse, people often become unable to understand the analog clock face and benefit from just having the actual time in digits.Of these three watches, two are outstanding, and one is good if the person’s vision is still good enough. I expect that all will require us to set the time if it should need changing for any reason. I’m giving Dad all three, although the first two in the list were immediate hits.Here are the watches and why I chose them:

  I was looking for a waterproof watch with large numbers so that I can easily glance down and track my time while running and riding my horse. This watch meets those needs and more. The first day wearing it, I bathed my horse, which included submerging my wrist into a 5-gallon bucket repeatedly. No issue! Watch still looks and works good as new. I'm very impressed with how easy it is to set and how adjustable the band is. This watch is seemingly indestructible and even appears more expensive than it really is. As an added bonus, I like that it includes the day of the week and the date as well as easy-to-use timer and stopwatch features. I'm sure there are a few more features that I haven't discovered yet.

  It's a great watch. I decided to get the watch after watching some amazing review videos on YouTube some time ago.FEATURES:Hourly chime(optional). One alarm. Chronograph(stopwatch) with split times(no lap memory). 12 and 24 hour time modes, and features the date, month, and day of the week(no year). It DOES NOT have any countdown timer.PROS:The watch fits very well. It's very comfortable to wear.The light function is very bright, and provides excellent visibility. This watch lights up brighter than my new Timex with the indiglo.It's waterproof. I've only had it for a couple days so far, but I've showered, washed my hands, and washed dishes with it on and haven't had an issue.CONS:The only con is that it doesn't track the year, so no leap years.NOTES ON OTHER REVIEWERS' COMPLAINTS:Some complain that the face is hard to read, because at an angle, the full [number print?] of the display comes in to view, and the screen ""turns to gibberish"". It's true that if you hold it at a weird angle, it becomes unreadable, but all LCD displays of this type do that; calculators, watches, and anything else. I've included a picture to show what I'm talking about.(Note the weird angle at which I'm holding the watch in the photo, nobody checks their watch this way.) This claim is ridiculous and unreasonable, as long as you have the watch pointed at you when you're looking at it, like normal, then it's not a problem at all. Maybe, these people are trying to perform some kind of acrobatic feat, or check the time during a yoga pose, but when you're actually LOOKING AT the watch, the display is perfect.Also, for those people who complain that every time you cycle the modes, it gives you the option to set the time, press the reset button while on the chronograph, or otherwise changing any setting, that eliminates this problem. Though, I don't know why they're pressing buttons to change mode if they're not using the stopwatch or alarm.A few people here will give you the impression that it's a huge watch, but that's not the case. The fit is surprisingly comfortable.Unlike some will tell you, the watch DOES NOT beep when you press the light button, that is absolutely untrue.

  Great product. You can't get more bang for your buck.I needed a watch or the outdoors, hiking, that I wouldnt mind roughing up and that was waterproof and very readable and strong LED light. The LED display did not disappoint. I confirm that at a certain angle the only thing you will see is 88:88....but I mean it is really irrelevant to me....Another important factor for me was the bracelet and whether I'd sweat like a pig. I ve worn it in 100 F condition and it was not different than any other watches that I own...In summary. Cheap, simple, bright LED, does chrono, alarm etc...

  I bought this for practices with my 7-8 year old soccer team. It's a little smaller than our regulation goals but it gives them a target to work with.  It's fine for practice but I have a couple complaints:1. It's put together with like tent poles that you thread through the net.  The joints on the tent poles are a little lose so when moving it around they come apart and you have to put it back together.  This set up also makes taking the tent poles out of the net a real pain so I normally just transport it with the bottom connectors off and it folded in half.  Not a big deal but if you have a smaller car that won't work.2. There is a strap between the two bottom braces that connect the top pole to the bottom pole.  Which that is nice so you can't lose your bottom braces but it's really impractical in the soccer goal.  At least once a practice I have a kid that gets tripped by that strap.3. This isn't overly durable.  It would probably honestly work better if you are just using it around the house with one kid.  My team of 11 has put this through the ringer and it shows.  I've got seams unraveling on the net.  They managed to flip the net with a very hard goal kick which caused the nylon loop you are supposed to use to anchor it to rip off.  We've only used this for 4 practices.  It's getting the job done but I don't know how many seasons I'll really get out of this.

  I was able to use duct tape to make this product sturdy and useful.I read the reviews that questioned the sturdiness of this product but I bought it anyway. I've since used it in 5 practices with U8 boys and this is what I've learned. The first practice showed me that as it is, it does not have the sturdiness to withstand the constant assault that boys will unleash on it. The straight connectors are too shallow. Merely kicking the ball in the net is enough to dislodge it.So I took it home after the first practice and tightly duct taped the straight connectors together. I did not connect the corner connectors because they are deep (3"" or so) and I did want some movement so as not to break anything. That did the trick.4 practices later and these nets have withstood everything without an issue. The kids lay on it, kick it, roll into it and it hasn't given up. It stays together. Now it's perfect.I'll never put it back into the small carrying bag again but that's okay. It folds up into a compact size for travel. So I'm now happy with this product.Again, you will need duct tape to make this product sturdy and useful. Otherwise it will constantly separate at the side connectors. Definitely happy that I bought this... After my improvement.

  Upon initial opening in building I loved it it was amazing it’s the perfect size it folds together nice and neat. The first time we went to use it I was on able to get the top to snap together when I looked at it it had snapped off inside the bracket. So I pulled the broken piece out and put it back together and put it away. We went to use it again the same piece was broken again so I am very disappointed that the top bar keeps breaking. Lost an inch off the top due do it breaking twice. $20 for one goal is already expensive and now the fact that he keeps breaking is really pissing me off.

  I bought this soccer net for my children because it seems like good quality for the price. It came in a very tiny box and it is at that point it should’ve been suspicious. The instructions are very vague, it took me about 25 minutes to assemble the product. The entire soccer net is much smaller than appears in the product picture, and it is very flimsy. My kids will surely be kicking through this and knocking it over (even with the stakes). The biggest upset about the net is the fact that on each side the support strings are completely frayed and falling apart. Came like that right out of the box. I’ve only had this net for about 30 minutes, the kids have not even used it yet and I can already tell it’s going to be falling apart by next week. Do not buy!

  Unfortunately, and somewhat painfully, the low-quality metal used in the linked rods of this product shave off into sharp micro-fibers, as a result of the friction of sliding them together or apart to assemble or disassemble the goal. These metal fibers lodged in my fingers, producing a splinter sensation that lasted a couple days. I thought not much of it, but then, weeks later, my young daughter had the same thing happen to her (she really likes putting the rods together, to make the goal). These very small metal shavings remained in her skin for a day or so, and were painful.Bottom line: it's a cheap product, for a reason. The metal shaves off and doesn't easily wipe away. Disappointed with the quality here.

  Poles did not stay connected when we’d try to set up this goal.  It took me forever during our first use to get it to a point it was usable and it still wasn’t all the way up.  Returned immediately and got actual pop up goals that fold up or down very quickly.  To me that was worth the extra cost.

  This is a good weight, thick and durable mat, for anyone needing extra protection while exercising.  It's a must for me due to some spinal irregularities needing comforting support.  Heck, you can end your routine with a quick nap on it, as well.  It's that comfy.The missing star is for the terrible off-gasing that I had to deal with on arrival.  The smell was so strong that I had to get it out of the house. I placed it in the garage, opened and stretched out for full airing.  My goodness, when I walked in the garage, it smelled just like my visits to the local Discount Tires. I even burned some incense to try to mask it, but the smell won.So, if you have patience you will really like this mat.  It's a good value for the comfort and durability.  The smell will eventually dissipate, but it will take a good while.

  After reading all the positive reviews, I bought this mat for physio therapy and maybe some yoga.When it arrived the smell was pretty overpowering but I figured it would subside with time.Nope.I have used this mat twice since purchase in November 2017 and it is now the end of April 2018 (6 months).The first time I used it, my clothes smelled so bad from lying on the mat that I had to change out of them hours later. The second time I used the mat, I placed a towel down first. But the smell was so terrible that I could not focus or finish my physio therapy. Six months of owning this mat, and the smell is just as strong, and just as unbearable.Yes, it is on the less expensive side as far as exercise mats go, but my suggestion would be to put that money towards a higher quality mat.I am going to have to throw this mat away, and the money I invested, right along with it.

  This approximately 3/4 inch thick mat is 'comfy' for this 71-year-old guy: I am overweight but I don't 'bottom out' on this.  The foam is flexible enough to unroll and to roll up again and again with ease.  The elasticized sling carrier has held up well and stretches easily enough to that the roll doesn't have to be wrapped as tight as possible for things to work.  I do find that the foam is 'tender' in that sharp stones and the like will harm it...but used indoors (or on a ground cloth or tent floor for camping) this is a great product!  I am very pleased that I found it and I believe that many shoppers who have similar needs will feel the same way!

  The maintenance of your treadmill is easily overlooked & sometimes totally forgotten. One of the most important pieces of maintenance that is relatively simple & which does not take much time to perform, is cleaning & lubricating the belt. Spot On 100% Silicone Treadmill Belt Lubricant is a must have for my treadmill. Made in the USA is a bonus. The extra long application tube makes applying the lubricant under the treadmill belt & across the treadmill platform very easy.To properly lubricate the treadmill belt, you must first clean the underside of the belt & the top of the treadmill platform. To do this, loosen the belt tensioning screws until you are able to slide a dry clean towel under the belt & across the platform. Carefully run the towel from one end of the platform to the other & then back to the center. Carefully (you may need someone helping you) while holding the towel across the center of the platform, turn the belt on its slowest speed, so it runs over the towel wiping clean the underside of the belt. Remove the towel. Now take the Spot On Silicon Lubricant w/the long application tube attached, apply approximately 1oz of lube across the treadmill platform. Retighten the treadmill belt being sure to center the belt. Once tightened, turn the treadmill on a slow speed & walk on the treadmill to allow the lube to spread across the platform. That’s it.It will depend on how often you use your treadmill as to how often you’ll need to lubricate your treadmill. I use my treadmill 4-7 times a week. I lube my treadmill every 3 months, so the bottle of Spot On lasts a year. You should check your manual or manufacturer’s website to see if silicone lube is right for your treadmill & how often it should be lubricated.Thank you for taking time to read my review, I hope it was helpful.

  Worked Great on my Pro-Form 300 treadmill belt, and also, Thanks to the person who suggested the drinking straw (See Attached Picture) this helps to keep oiler line straighter, and makes it much easier to apply. I used a 3/8"" wood dowl rod and fed it under belt to lift from walking surface. It opened the gap, and allowed a good enough clearance to see and apply oil...(and to the person that had issue of oil coming out when squeezing bottle. ?) Well this, as with almost all liquid products does have a cap seal that needs to be removed too. Just a FYI

  Well,Can't figure out how people have trouble applying this lube.  It works like piece of cake.  Just lift the belt and insert the tube in and pull out as you squeeze leaving lube behind.  If you can't lift the belt, it's probably too tight in the first place.  Then to the other side and do the same.  When the package arrives the tube is bent, but it straightens easily and the process couldn't be easier.  As for the lube, it seems to work just fine, the belt noise is reduced and the belt lag is eliminated.  In fact, I loosened the belt some so it wasn't so tight and it seems to run better than ever.  For a 30 yr old treadmill to have new life is a good thing.  Now if they invented an effective lube for my 70 yr old body, we'd be better yet.  Good product, super easy application, don't hesitate to buy this lubricant.  My treadmill is a Proform 525E model, instruction book says to not use lubricant, but in fact they sell a lubricant if you need one so take that with a grain of salt.

  There were complaints that the tube is not rigid enough. It is not enough to force it under the belt. So, slip a piece of cardboard under the center of the belt, and then slide the tube in next to it, since there will be no resistance it easily goes to the center of the belt. Did that, and the process was very easy and quick.

  My treadmill has been stored in our basement since we moved into this house 3 years ago.  When I had it moved upstairs to the den, I could feel that it was dry under the belt.  When I turned on the machine, it was louder than I remembered so I did some on line research and discovered this Silicone Treadmill Belt Lubricant.  I watched a You Tube film showing how to use the product and found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price.I used it as soon as it arrived applying it liberally under the belt with the applicator tube that was included.  It was very easy to use!  It worked very well and within minutes after lubricating the belt and walking on it for awhile, the noise was gone.  The belt moves more smoothly as well.  I will use  it again as needed and recommend it to other treadmill owners.

   I think the product works? I’ve used it twice so far. My only concern is that the small black tip on the applicator straw, can accidentally come off under the belt ,when you’re lubricating it .if there’s a little pressure on the belt As you pull the straw out with the bottle ,that little black cap can come off. It happened to me and I had to get some thing to slip it under the belt to swish it out. Beware My cats use the treadmill every night so it seems to help. I gave it three stars because I was afraid that tip would have gotten stuck under the belt and jammed up my whole treadmill. Just letting you know to be aware!

  These cards seem to be made of teflon coated sheet steel.  They are so stiff it is impossible to do a bridge shuffle, even with the cards split in 2 stacks of 26 cards they cannot be bent enough to riffle.  They also seem to be coated with something along the lines of nylon or teflon.  They are so slick that if you set the deck down on an uneven surface cards will just slide off the stack.  The face of the cards have a knitted pattern of threads in squares.  I have taken cards and flexed and flexed and flexed to try to soften them up to no avail.  With the slick plastic coating they should be waterproof.If you wanted to do card tricks or shuffle tricks steer clear of these.  They are far to slick to be manipulated artfully.  You cannot fan them out because the cards have to be held by hands, card to card surface will just slip and slide like they are oiled.These would be great cards for grade school age kids, they seem like they will be indestructible and waterproof with the thick nylon/plastic coating.  Of course some kids will be disappointed that they cannot play 52 card pick up with these since they can't be flexed enough to flip them all out.

  They are nice enough cards, but they are not standard size. Standard cards(poker) are 3.5"" x 2.5"" while these are 3 7/16"" x 2 7/16"". Doesn't seem like much but it does make a difference. I haven't played with them yet so I don't have an opinion on durability at the moment.Update: the cards fall apart after playing with them for a couple of days.

  Me and the fellas have our poker sessions about 4 times a year.  We go through packs of cards rather quickly due to the drinking and smoking that goes on during play.  A little alcoholic spillage here, a cigar or cigarette burn there . . .  oh well.  The font and pictures on the cards are standard and easy to read.  Which is a relief because we've had to make emergency trips to the liquor store to pick up a deck of cards and have come back with some eccentric looking cards. Ex:  Block numbers, K-J's that were illustrations of past Presidents!  LOL  The cards slide easily on the table and are a great price for the 12 decks.

  Very nice cards for the price.  I was a bit dubious about ordering these, given their low price compared to other brands, but I needed to get several decks and do so on a strict budget.  I was really pleased when I opened up the first deck and found them to be well-made, well-mrked, easy to handle.

  16 God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son. Anyone who believes in him will not die but will have eternal life. 17 God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world. He sent his Son to save the world through him.  John 3:16,17 NIRV 18 Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because [b]he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. John 3:18 Amplified Bible 15 And if anyone’s name was not found written in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire. Revelation 20:15 Amplified BibleRevelation 20:15 Since everyone who goes before the great white throne is to be tried and sentenced for his deeds, and no one is sinless, the only way to escape condemnation and the “lake of fire” is to have one’s name in the “Book of Life” through authentic faith in Jesus as Lord (see Ps 69:28; Phil 4:3; Rev 3:5).

  We play cards in a daily basis. Normally I go and get the punched cards from casinos from discount stores. These last for about 6 months before showing wear.These cards we bought look great! Have a smooth finish, perfect for shuffling. We have used one deck for a little over 2 months and they are already peeling to where you know what card your partner has because of the purple color that comes through.For the price of all these decks it's not a bad deal- but we will go back to using the old casino cards when we go through all the decks we bought and didn't give to kids for college

  These cards are high quality cards, and it addrived very quick. After few months play, usually once a week for 3-4 hours each time, it still good. Only a little worn out at the edges.

  I have a bunch of balls that require air to fully enhance their Fun Quotient. I tried using my nice bike tire pump. Fail. So this little pump is exactly what I need to put some bounce back into those toys that require it. Small, so it stores easily, because air just leaks out very slowly. You might attach the needles to the pump, just a suggestion from someone who should have known better and lost them.

  Immediately upon inserting the needle to pump up a ball, air started escaping. I only managed to pump the ball to a somewhat adequate level by pumping like mad. The next time I tried pumping, no air would come out of the pump. It was like there was no oil left in there so no pressure. You get what you pay for. I will be returning this and purchasing a new pump, so I can start pumping balls again

  I coach Middle School Football and we can never seem to have enough of these small, inexpensive hand pumps around for those refs that believe we may be attempting to ""Brady Ball"" them. This particular unit saved us from having to turn around a bus midway to a game to get another pump as we inflated one of our game balls in route, but it only worked once...

  The pump itself is of poor quality, broke after 3 uses.  Don't plan for this thing to last too long.  It seems there is a whatever makes up the pressure mechanism inside cannot handle much pressure at all, and breaks after a less than typical task.  The only good thing is that it does come with a couple needles and other accessories, which are probably worth the amount paid for the package.  Oh well, lesson learned.

  Ok, so this tape is magical.  Seriously, there must be some fairy dust or produced by the gods of endurance to work as well as it does.  Why do I say this?  I just finished a 2700 mile self supported mountain bike race.  I had never used this tape but have had issues with one of my knees for years.  I've been to orthopedists, physical therapists, etc.  Had shots of different substances but never received complete relief.Well, after one day into this race I had ridden 100 miles and my knee was acting up.  I decided, what the hell, I'll give this stuff a shot.  I taped my knee as stated in the little guide it shipped with and then next day I rode 140 miles...with no pain.  I was amazed but thought that maybe it was a placebo effect?? Then I rode the next day, and the next and so forth.  27 day 100+ mile days with no pain. Amazing!I know this sounds like an infomercial but this tape saved my race and I am super happy with it.  I could wear it for around 5 days in a row and then had to replace it.I also had some achillies tendon problems during the race and used this tape.  It helped a little but no where near what it did for my knee.I picked this brand because, quite frankly, it was less expensive than some of the others and came in a roll...which was nice so that I could cut it to size.  I highly recommend this tape.

  I'm using this over my healing burn scars on my chest- I was in a bonfire accident and suffered 10% burn to my chest and right arm.  In physical therapy, they were sending me home with kinesiology tape over the scars to promote flattening and softening.  While it worked, the tape wouldn't stick well and I'd have to wear high neck tops to keep it from peeling off completely.  I decided to order my own so that I could at least have fresh stuff on hand to reapply each day.  This is so much higher quality than I received at the burn center!  It sticks so well and it doesn't make me itch or burn like the other stuff.  It stretches well and doesn't fall off after my shower!  Highly recommend and I'm even bringing this with me to pt for now on so the doctors can use this tape instead.  Super satisfied and will likely reorder if I need to!

  I used this tape to hold up my DD breasts in a custom-made evening gown that was VERY open. It works!!!!! The BEST lift EVER, and I danced all night and sat by a fire pit. My advice: Plan your best methods to lift them in your garment and measure BEFORE you apply the tape. And I used coconut oil to soak the tape off overnight before I EASILY peeled it off the following day. DO NOT RIP THIS TAPE OFF YOUR SKIN! It will take your skin with it.

  This stuff is virtually identical to the popular KT Tape and Rock Tape, but cheaper and comes in more colors. I got this individual roll and loved it so much I just purchased a bulk roll (which btw is about 50% cheaper in the long run!) I personally use adhesive tape for binding my chest, and it does exactly what I want. If you do things ahead of time to make it last longer (isopropyl alcohol on the skin first, not stretching the last inch at the ends of the tape, and rubbing it for a few minutes after applying) it will last several days. Some folks can make it last for weeks. Be sure not to rip the tape off like a bandaid... Remove it gently in the shower because it WILL give you a blister or take off layers of skin (yes it is THAT adhesive!).

  My fitbit malfunctioned and was out of warranty so I needed another tracker.  This one had good ratings and had what I wanted (it actually has more features that I currently use!).  If you want a fancy tons of bells and whistles that is like an apple watch, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something comparable to a $100 dollar fitness tracker, you will be HAPPY!  I mainly use this for time (it is a watch afterall!)  and to track my steps.  I think it is actually more accurate the my previous more expensive device.  I also LOVE the fact that the time display is larger (since I use reading glasses) and the display is easier to read in daylight compared to the more expensive tracker.  The heartrate feature takes a few seconds before a heartrate is displayed (compared to the instant display on a fitbit) but that is the only ""issue"" I have found .  The heartrate also appears to be very accurate.  The features I have not yet used are connected to the app.  The watch will alert you to phone calls and text messages. It will also track your exercise (bike, walk, run) and your sleep..  I have not enabled these features yet.  For more petite women, you may want to purchase a smaller wrist band (I am using the very first hole on the band)I have had the watch about a month and so far have been very pleased!  It charges well (and more easily than the more expensive tracker). From my experience, it also holds a charge for a bit longer ( a little over a week).  For people like me who do not need tons of fancy stuff but appreciate a reliable product, this is the perfect watch!

  I bought the black Letscom tracker after my Fitbit Zip died and I found out they no longer manufacture them. Not gonna lie, I would have bought another Zip if I found it used for about $20, but the Zips on eBay were selling for around $50, which is much more than I'm willing to pay for a used, outdated fitness tracker.Anyway, after researching different options I settled on the Letscom tracker. I liked that it was only $30 which is big for me because I don't have lots of disposable income to throw around.Although I'm not a big fan of the ""watch"" aspect, I'm getting used to wearing one again. I would much prefer if they had a way to clip it to your belt, but I can't seem to find a clip accessory. Hopefully they'll offer it in the future.Honestly, I only bought this thing for it's step tracking abilities. There are a bunch of other features that I basically ignore. I've tested ""run mode"" and ""bike mode"" and they work just fine but I never use them. Who knows? Maybe I'll change my mind someday. I guess it's good that I have the option.Things I like about this tracker:* It's super accurate when counting steps. I figured I was wasting my money on this tracker buying from a relatively unknown company. I'm happy to admit that I was wrong. It does a great job accurately counting steps.* I appreciate that it's waterproof up to a point. They say don't wear it in the shower or swimming pool and I don't. But I'm glad that I can still wear it while washing my hands. I have a weak bladder and pee a lot throughout the day. It's much easier being able to wash my hands while wearing the watch instead of having to take it off 7-10 times a day whenever I use the rest room.* It was easy to connect to the app on my phone. Sometimes pairing Bluetooth devices to your phone can be a downright pain the neck. This paired on the first try and hasn't needed to be re-paired once since I've been using it for more than a month now. My Bluetooth scale needs to get paired again at least 3 times a week, which is super annoying. So kudos for making an easy device that actually works!* The watch is thin and not too bulky or heavy. I don't like wearing watches. I have no problem admitting it. And it took some getting used to with this watch. But because it's thin and light, it didn't take too long to feel normal. I'd still prefer a belt clip, but this is okay since I have no other choice.* It's pretty easy to charge. I know it says it will last a week. Mine doesn't go quite as long. I usually have to charge it every 3 days which isn't too bad. Pulling off the watch band and plugging it in to a USB port is really easy. And it charges in less than an hour, which is great.That's about all I have to say about the Letscom watch fitness tracker. This review went a lot longer than I anticipated.All in all, this is a good tracker that I'm glad I bought. I miss the online community aspect with Fitbit, so maybe they'll create one in the future. Besides that, if you want an inexpensive, accurate, easy to use step counter and fitness tracker this is a great option. I highly recommend it.

  I love this product so much. I bought a second one for my mom. It isnt ultra hi tech but it does everything you need to. It counts steps, heart rate etc. It tells the time and can also link to your phone for calls and texts.I bought this to see if I would use it and if I could justify paying for an apple watch. I also convinced two of my co workers to buy them too! You only need to charge it every 5 days or so and when it does need to be charged it charges in about 30 mins.The customer support is also awesome. Two of the bands broke and they replaced them immediately for me.

  I got these for my 1 and 3 yr old daughters. They are amazing. Not to sound so cliched, but I’ve never written a review before and I felt compelled to do so now because these floaties have changed our lives this summer. Both the 1 and 3 yr old can float next to us in the water. They are safe. They girls can keep their heads up independently. And if one gets out of the pool to toddle around on the deck, I’m not chasing right behind them, paranoid that at any moment I’ll have to dive in the pool and scoop someone up. I love these. The product says it’s for a child with a minimum weight of 30 lbs. Neither of my daughters have hit 30 lbs yet but these are adjustable and fit snugly, even around my 21 lb one year old. There is extra fabric at the shoulders, but that does not prevent the float from doing its job. My girls love these and I do too!

  If you’re looking for a beginner floatie jacket for your toddler, you have found it! My daughter is 13 months old, walking, and tall but very thin. She weighs about 18 lbs, so I was worried about finding one of these jackets that would fit snugly around her chest/trunk. This was a perfect fit and worked great in the pool. It’s helping to teach her to keep her head up and kick her legs to propel herself. The only reason I didn’t give this jacket 5 stars is that the girl patterns are kind of ugly. We went with hula girl, but none of the girl ones were nice and the boy ones were really boy ish. How about some gender neutral ones? That would be nice.

  I have been searching for a swimmy like this for some time now for my 2yr old! I like his regular puddle jumper but it would sag & he was able to remove his arms from it when out of the water and that made me nervous. Tried this one today, as soon as it was delivered, and it’s AMAZING. It fits tighter than his puddle jumper even though it says 30-50lbs (he only weighs 23lbs). So happy I got this one. And he loves it too! If you’re questioning it because of the weight recommendations (just like I did), it’s definitely worth trying! I couldn’t even tighten it all the way (unlike his other puddle jumper). Fits super snug.

  My 16 month old loves to jump in the pool with her big sisters, so we needed to find something for her to wear! Typical life jackets for infants are much too bulky and she couldn't kick around and swim.  Puddle jumpers worked, but made us a little nervous as she's so young and could take her arms out.  I saw this shoulder strap style on another child and bought it to try out.  It works well when we cinch it as tight as it goes.  She loves being able to ""swim""! My only complaint is she weighs 22 lbs, and no company makes these for under 30! So it is a little big on her, even though it works.  Wish I could buy one for a smaller child.

  We borrowed one of these on a trip where there was a swimming pool. My 2 year old is able swim on her own in the water and stay afloat. I had originally brought our super amazing lifejacket, but it kept putting her on her back like it should in an emergency. This was not what I wanted in the pool. I love that these are an approved PFD. These also have shoulders to keep the kiddos from taking them off on their own, which is what we need with a toddler who seems to get in/out of everything she is wearing. She goes to the pool for family swim almost weekly and this always comes with. Highly recommended!

  This product is nothing short of amazing, first off my daughter is 20 months old and around 28-30 lbs. It fits her so well and is tight enough around her little body. She is secure in the life jacket, it does NOT slip all around or off. The raised chest piece helps keep her head and body in an upright position. As well as the arm pieces. This is made out of a foam like layers so you do not have to worry about it popping like traditional ""arm floats"" which I do NOT recommend for younger kids what so ever. Hope this help a mommy or daddy looking for something safe for their young babies to enjoy the water. As always use caution in any water with children. This is my second purchase just so the designs on the life jackets are so cute. And the price point $20-$25, TO SAVE YOUR CHILD in and around water.. Priceless !

  I bought these for my dog who became addicted to a practice ball he found when we went walking on our local ballfield. I don’t know what brand he found there, but the leather on the mystery ball is much thicker and more durable than these. That said, these are not meant for kids to be chewing on. I think the leather would hold up just fine if you were using it for its intended use. So don’t go by my score. If you buy these for your dog to chew on, slip them down into an old sock. Ralphie loves his Ball Sack, especially since he doesn’t have one of his own. 😂 And putting the ball inside the sock makes the leather last longer, a win-win for us both! 🐾🐾👍🏼👍🏼

The size is perfect to me , easy to fold up and spreading, doesn't accupied much space. Good quality! The surface of the bench feels comfortable and it doesn't slipped when you sit on top to do exercise. Although it have a little bit smell, I think the smell will dissapear after a couple day. It doesn't matter because it is a new equipment. I like it can adjustable any altitude that you want. I hope this bench can urge me to stick at exercise. when I see it, I'll remember to that I have to move, which is less time and less money than going to the gym.

  The foot holds are so poorly designed and equally poorly placed, they are non-functional.  The foot holds are far too small for a person of average size and weight to use.  They are also fixed so close to the bench's structural beams, there is no useful or practical way to anchor one's feet while exercising. I am very disappointed and would appreciate a replacement bench which is more satisfactorily designed and crafted.UPDATE:  Flybird customer service representative, ""Dena,"" was exceptionally accommodating and responsive.Dena considered my initial feedback regarding the poorly designed and equally poorly placed foot holds on the original bench the company sent.Within a couple days, Dena shipped me a replacement bench which was considerably sturdier and noticeably better designed than the original.I was dually impressed by the level of customer service Dena provided and am satisfied with the replacement bench Flybird provided at no additional cost.

Can’t not be more convenient so I recommend getting these over its competitors, much better overall and great for its price!Bottom Line:5 stars out of 5Pros:-Quality material-Adjustable backrest.-Easy Installation.Cons:None

  This workout bench is not bad at all for its price and capabilities. It can incline and decline to the most comfortable angle that you will like. I need an adjustable bench, but there wasn't a single space, I just put it in my bedroom, and this fit perfectly. It's strong. It is safe and not to shake during exercise. The cushion is long and comfortable which is enough me. The leg holder bar is reliable when I use this bench for sit-ups, it can be removed. The bench has a plastic cover on its leg so that no matter how I moved it, it wouldn't scratch my floor. This is great. I use it every day to exercise. I am satisfied with my purchase.

  Great product. I used to go to gym which cost me $120 a month and 30minutes driving back and forth. Now instead spending that amount of money and time, I do exercise at home using this bench. It really helps me to do all the position I need to do to train my arms. I am very satisfied with its  design and price. The package includes a Allen wrench that will help you assemble the bench and trust me it is not a hard task to do. The beach stay durable, no shape changes or strange sounds come out. I am having the feeling that it will stay with me for a good long time.

  I do a boxing class at least 3 times a week for 2 hours.  I’ve tried a few brands; so far, these are one the best hand wraps I’ve used next to Everlast.  *My Everlast lasted over a year; it started to shred and broke into two pieces. But no issues with the velcro or any of the thumb loops.  *I tried Ringside; the velcro started to come off after the second use.  The thumb loop started to break off after less than 2 months.They are long, stretchy, soft, and not too thick.  I’m still able to wear them comfortably with my boxing gloves without any issues.  No problem with the velcro or the thumb loops.When cleaning, I sometimes hand wash them and air dry them after each use.  When I do wash them in the machine; I put the wraps in the mesh bag and air dry.

  These are a little thinner than the ones my gym sells (9Round) but work well and have just the right amount of stretch. The ONLY complaint I have is that there is no marking denoting the surface to put against the skin when you start wrapping, so if you don't start it right the velcro closure won't close right. No big deal, and what do you expect for an inexpensive wrap, but just giving you info in case that matters to you.

  Started my boxing class this week and I noticed a flaw where there is a hole developing after 1 use and gets bigger if I pull it right.  Of course the return window closed less than 24 hours ago - probably won’t get this brand again.  Wish I could have exchanged them since it could be a manufacturing fluke.

  Excellent quality hand wraps at a much better price point than I could find locally. I picked up one pair, but I'll probably buy another soon for the days I want to wash them. These make a great gift for any combat sports practitioner.Pros:- Slightly stretchy material doesn't cut off my circulation as easily as standard hand wraps- Super comfortable material- Thumb loop doesn't rub the inside of my finger (bad experience with different ones)- Bright color choices if that's your thing (I went with Black to match all my other gear)- No weird Ace bandage smellCons:- I'll never have the patience to wrap them back up all nice so they will just be loose in my gym bagIt's really important to have a good wrapping technique. If you're not sure, watch some YouTube videos and try out a few methods until you find one you like.

  My favorite wraps, of all the main brands. I bought wraps from each of the popular companies on Amazon (Sanabul, Meister, Everlast, Ringside, and Pro Impact) and tested each of them. I found that Sanabul & Meister wraps are very similar.. They're soft and feel well made. They don't feel too thin and have held up quality-wise use-after-use. Tied for first place!In second place behind Sanabul & Meister, are Ringside Mexican Style wraps, which are also really nice. The main difference is that Ringside wraps are stiffer, so it's really a matter of preference and I don't think you'd go wrong with any of those three options.Third place goes to Everlast, which I would not recommend as they are low quality and tend to fall apart quite quickly. And last place are the Pro Impact wraps, which were extremely uncomfortable and scratchy...

  Wow they feel great! I’m going to test them tonight at the boxing gym. I received the set this afternoon and wrapped one hand. The feel is uncredibe; soft, breathable and easy to secure. They have elastic so the fit is asjustable and you don’t have to unwrap to rewrap which clearly saves time. The fact the fit is adjustable is worth five stars alone. My boxing coach said to get 180’ inch wraps since I used 108’. My previous three sets (all Title brand) are tattered and ruined. They really don’t last very long but it’s ok because they serve as a knee wrap. I actually wrapped my knee with one this past Saturday. I purchased Title wraps because that’s the only brand found at the store. Title is a sound brand no questions about their standing but their inexpensive hand-wraps don’t hold up long. I’ve gone thru three sets in two months. They’re still wearable but the material is stressed, stained and unraveling. My Sanabul 14oz gloves are awesome so I’m confident their wraps won’t disappoint. As for gloves and wraps, Sanabul is my go-to for boxing supplies.

  These came really fast, are very comfortable while doing their job, and are well made. The finished wrap is supportive and the Velcro at the wrist is just the right size. I am a female with fairly small hands, and these feel adequate in length without going on forever. I would buy these again. I got black, and the finished wrap has a nice black and grey label, which looks nice.

  This is the first time I'm trying out elastic wraps.  Previously I've only had not-so-stretchy cotton wraps, not because of preference but because that's what I picked up from my gym.  While the cotton wraps provided good support and protection, I hated how it would get so rancid after just one workout.  Since I started working out 5-6 times a week, I decided to try out different ones to use throughout the week, rather than washing the same pair every day.I am, by no means, an athlete or a fighter.  I'm just a dude trying to get in shape and lose weight.  I do cardio kickboxing 5-6 times a week, about 30 mins at a time.  There are about 3-4 rounds of heavy bag type work where you actually need the support.  The rest of the time its different full body workouts, but you just have your handwraps on.The wraps are very soft and seem to be sturdy.  The stitching doesn't look like it will get undone anytime soon, but we'll see in a few months.I realize I do need to apply these wraps a little tighter than I would on the cotton wraps.  The first time I used it, I ended up tweaking my right wrist a little.  I'm not going to fault the wrap just yet, because I do believe I didn't wrap my hands tight enough.  I am able to wrap my hands tighter with these wraps without worrying about cutting off circulation.One small thing, which I don't care personally, is that there is a slight color difference between the pair.  The picture shows the wraps after 1 wash.  It is more noticeable in person, but again, not that big of a deal.

  My car battery was discharged to the point that my Battery Tender Plus 1.25A charger/maintainer would not even attempt to charge it. I purchased a Noco Genius5 charger/maintainer that has successfully charged my battery without requiring that I activate Noco's 'force mode' that will charge a battery that has become discharged to 0 volts.Below are three points to keep in mind if you decide to buy a Noco charger/maintainer.1. Select the correct Noco for your battery. Each Noco is rated for a certain number of Amp-hours (Ah). The Genius2 is rated for 40Ah, the Genius5 is rated for 120Ah, and the Genius10 is rated for 230Ah. My car battery's capacity is 92Ah, so the Genius2 would not be able to fully charge it; however, the Genius5 is able to fully charge it.2. Be patient because the Noco may require longer to charge your battery than the owner's manual suggests, for two reasons. First, the '25% charge' step includes a de-sulfation process that can take some time - for my discharged battery, more than 24 hours were required for this step. Second, the '100% charge' step includes an optimization process that can also take some time. So, whereas the Noco spent only a few hours in each of the '50% charge' and '75% charge' steps, the '25% charge' and '100% charge' steps required more time.3. As the Owner's Manual indicates, you MUST disconnect your battery from your vehicle prior to activating 12V Repair mode; otherwise, you risk damaging your vehicle's electronics.

  I purchased this because one of the customer questions on Amazon was answered by the manufacturer as follows:Question: Can I use this to maintain the charge in my car and leave it unattended for months during winter storage?Answer:Yes, it can safely maintain a battery all winter long.By NOCO Support MANUFACTURER  on December 9, 2019However, as you will see on the cover page of the user manual (image attached) it says not to use it unattended. (I added the red highlight in the attached picture.)I'm sure that it will probably work, but the point is that this is not a must-have purchase. I bought it for peace of mind and convenience on a car that would be stored through the winter. However, that peace of mind is out the window if the manufacturer feels they need to make a disclaimer upfront.Bottom line, it may work as  charger, but it is not (according to the manufacturer's manual) recommended to maintain batteries unattended. I suppose the battery maintainer portion is technically true if you are willing to move into your garage and sleep with your car during the winter months [grin].

  This brought back the battery in my truck (year old or so battery). I drive it 2-3 times a week to keep it chrged and all that (not a daily). One day I came out to zero volts. It sat that way for a week, and no regular charger could keep it alive more than a few hours. I used the force feature to start it, and once it said it was ""charged"" I switched it to recovery. Might be some damage in the life, but it starts like new.

So I bought the NOCO GENIUS5, which is a perfect match for the cars battery type and capacity characteristics.

  Despite what my liberal arts-educated self hoped, these things operate on plain old evaporation and not some magical cooling properties.I never thought I would buy these and considered them useless, until I had a toddler who overheats at the drop of (her) hat. These cloths help a lot! I wet them and keep them in a ziplock baggie in the car whenever we go to the park or hiking in the summer. When they’re needed, I just wring , snap, and proceed to being cooled.I even use these for myself after a run- if they work to cool me, they’ll work for anyone!Definitely recommend!

  I'm an avid biker (motorcycle) and living in the south it can be a tad unbearable at a stop light or being stuck in traffic in the high 90s with feels like temps in the 100s. I figured let's check a chance and see if these help. Our usual rides last for 4 hours and we stop at the end of a bridge half way to hang out on a seawall. I thought it would be perfect as we can dip our towels in and sit on the seawall with the sun at our backs and not melt away lol. They WORK! I don't how how, but WOW. Sitting on a seawall in the blaring sun in the summer after riding in the heat for a couple hours gets your body temp up. I have Epilepsy and I'm heat sensative and these help me ride in the summer. The coolness lasts for maybe 45 min on the ride back maybe because the wind dries it out fast, so we stop at a beach to recharge them for the rest of the ride home.While the colors of these aren't exactly what a 'biker' would choose, they do what they are intended to do. I'll buy more seeing we lost one on our last ride lol. They are the perfect length to spread across your shoulders or back and fold up small enough to fit in my leg bag.

  I guess I'm not sure what the hype over these were. They are just like a regular hand towel. You wet it, and it keeps you wet until it dries like a regular hand towel I will say it was very absorbent. I made a spill and just happened to have one of these around me. I used it to clean up a spill and it worked splendidly for that.

  I get nausea and dizzy when I overheat.  Without central air conditioning in an old rental house, summers in southern California can be unpleasant, but who cared when I spent the day in an overly cool office?  Then came WFH.  I use these towels in combination with frozen Thermafreeze strips in the summer.  I cut strips 3/4 of the circumference of my neck and/or head, freeze them.  Then I dampen the towel, wrap the strip and wear the two around my neck or head, and if it's really hot, both.  The towels do not retain oil/sweat, wash easily, and are fairly durable.  These are a bit longer than other sports towels and will tie or wrap comfortably even for big guys (my son is 6'3"" and big).

  I lap swim 1-3x/week, 1000-2000yd each time. When I first started my swimming routine, I bought these goggles. I loved them- they fit well, didn't leak, and didn't fog too badly. However, with constant use, they got scratched up, and I decided to try something new just for the heck of it.I have been through Speedo Vanquisher goggles, two pairs of Kayenne goggles, and Cressi Flash goggles, and I have hated them all.-The Vanquishers fog quickly, are not easy to adjust, and the lenses are small.-The Kaynnes are nice in theory, but underwater, they make your vision super blurry (hence, the two pairs- I returned the first to see if it was a fluke, but both pairs did the same thing).-I found that the Cressi, which are super similar to the Kayennes, make vision somewhat blurry (but not as bad as the Kayenne) and leak a lot.Hence, I have a new pair of Hydrospex goggles sitting in my Amazon shopping cart, and I am about to purchase a new pair, because they truly have been the best goggles I've used so far.

  I've been using speedo goggles for years. I purchased my previous pair more than 10 years ago and they still work fine, but they are inner eye goggles that really dig in (they are the tinted googles shown in the photo). I got the hydrospecs to prevent the all-day raccoon eye I would otherwise have from those.They are awesome! Within ten minutes of taking them off, all marks are gone. They're really comfortable and I haven't had any problems with leaks after a month of wear. They also are AMAZING at preventing fog. My other pair fog up after just 1 lap, and these don't fog up in the slightest throughout an entire 40 minute workout. I don't have to rinse them at all in between laps. I am making an effort to rinse the chlorine off in the sink when I'm done, so hopefully the antifog will last as long as possible.The only con I've noticed is that occassionally big bubbles will get caught on the lenses and I have to shake my head to get them off so I can see again. I think this is just a consequence of not being as streamlined as the inner eye style.

We have been using these goggles for several years - A plea to Speedo - PLEASE NEVER DISCONTINUE THESE GOGGLES!The biggest problem with OTHER goggles - leakage!  These goggles are soft all around the eye socket, and conform to most facial features, my wife, me and our 12 year old son all use them.

  These are decent goggles at a low price point but do have some major flaws.I didn't expect too much based on the price point but was looking for some decent goggles for my 2x per week swim workouts.  Lesson learned: you get what you pay for.  They do fit fairly well and don't irritate my eyes; however, the anti-fog coating worked for about 2 weeks (4 swim sessions) and there is no retainer for the excess strap so it just flaps around in the water.  I've never had a pair fo goggles without some way to retain the strap.  The only option on these is to cut off the exces which is a hassle and prevents and adjustments down the road.These are okay for your kids playing around but not recommended for serious swimming or swim workouts.

  Junk...I bought these to wear in the shower after having Lasik surgery for the first week post surgery. Just after the first couple of uses, there is some sort of film on the lenses, making the view very foggy and distorted. Then one of the lenses started to crack and slowly expand into a larger crack. For being used in an environment as mild as a shower and for how short term I used them, I can't believe how bad these are. I'm sure they'd be even worse in a pool with chlorine and other chemicals. Maybe I got a lemon, but these are terrible. The only good thing was that they fit comfortably, but if the lenses are going to get a film on them and start to crack with extremely mild use, don't both wasting your money or time with them.

  See update at bottom... New pair broke immediately, see user photosOverall these are great goggles.  They are comfortable around my head and eyes, keep water out, everything.However, they don't last that long.  I swim 3-4 times a week in the summer, and I usually go through 2 pairs a season.  After time the plastic on the eyes will get foggy and scratched, the plastic around the eyes will warp, and the whole thing starts turning yellow.They are still the best goggles I found for recreational swimming, so get a pair, but if you swim a lot, expect them to wear out before the season is over.UPDATE: Bought a new pair, they broke after 2 uses, nose piece snapped in half, see photos.  Contacted company and was ignored.

  I gave up on using silicone adhesive bras and pasties because they were too visible under clothing, didn't stick on well enough, were too heavy and would fall off, or were see-through and didn't hide the nips properly. Then I found this tape, and decided to try it.It's the perfect color for a light to medium tan complexion, is totally invisible under a white burnout super thin tee shirt, and sticks very strongly even when weather is hot. It reminds me of kinesiotape.The adhesive did not bother my skin.Basically all my wardrobe problems are solved.

I put two pieces on each breast and it lasted the whole night.I wouldn’t suggest if you gonna be dancing a lot cause the tape moves a little with you and I started to sweat a lot at a certain part of the night and felt a slight shift. But would definitely recommend.Also Don’t apply direct to nipple, the adhesive is strong. I improvised with a cotton square.

  Used the tape with a “high thigh” bathing suit to hold in some skin at the hips (weight loss surgery issues) held on after being in the water for several hours, removal was easy and pain free. Also used the tape for its intended “boob” purpose with a low cut dress (didn’t test it with water this time) held on really well and again removal was easy but then I realized.. I didn’t protect the nipples, which was dumb. Won’t be making that mistake again. I don’t have sensitive skin and didn’t get any irritation even with my questionable decision to tape over my nipples. Will be stocking up on this because bra straps aren’t cute and even “invisible” ones suck and those sticky bras don’t work if you’ve got a B cup and above.

  This definitely served the purpose I intended to use it for. I had never taped my boobs before getting this, so I was weary of how it would work, but i’m so glad I went with this tape. It held the ladies up for 7+ hours, and I was able to dance and sweat without it becoming unsticky. Taking it off wasn’t as scary as I expected either.

  Wore this with a Jenny Yoo bridesmaid dress (pic: I’m on the left) & it is AMAZINGGG! The dress had little to no support // no cups either. A little tough for sensitive skin to rip off (do it after drinking and you’ll be fine hah!) - but no rash or marks leftover. I have pretty sensitive skin too. Super comfy; easy to work with, etc. **Always have scissors on hand when using, you can’t use your teeth or hands to rip the actual tape!** 100% would recommend over sticky boobs/nipple cover flowers!

  I bought the vinyl dumbbells because they are cheaper that the neoprene kind. However, when I got them I was quite disappointed because the grip is very large. I have large hands for a woman, and my grip barely goes around the center. I wanted to return these, but I would have had to pay 50% in return shipping for what I bought them for, so I kept them. This was also frustrating to me, since the items were Amazon Prime. I will not be ordering vinyl AmazonBasics dumbbells again.

  BUYER BEWAREI purchased this set expecting to have two identical 10 lb weights. One weight was larger than the other even though both had ""10 lbs"" printed on the outside rubber material of the weights. Also, I weighed both weights I received separately and one was 2 lbs. lighter than (e.g. 8 lbs) then the expected ""10 lbs"" printed on the weight. Maybe they are low on stock and was hoping no one would notice as long as they printed ""10 lbs"" on the side and colored them the same. Buyers need to be aware.

  I've had this vacuum sealer for over a month now and I can say with confidence that its worth every penny. I refrained myself from reviewing products personally, but this product just had to be shared. I've been using this for multiple purposes from sealing processed food to packaging items. It has been a month+ since I've begun to use it and it seems to be holding up and working flawlessly. For the price of $53.49 to include a Lifetime Warranty is just a steal, of course within reason of it breaking. I'm a first time user myself so I was personally a bit uneasy to be working with such a new product. It comes with easy step by step instructions easy enough to read and understand for anyone. I hope this review was helpful for those who were seeking questions.

  Third one we've owned and by far my favorite. It just goes to show price point doesn't always equal quality. My last two were at least twice the cost. I can't speak to longevity, however I can definitely say that initial impression is excellent. Very easy to use and the fact that I can remove the top and wash the lower part makes cleanups a breeze. Anyone who's used this style vacuum sealer knows that the lower ""tray"" is what gets the dirtiest when marinating or sealing anything that contains even the slightest amount of liquid. If this holds up and proves durable, as I use it often for food storage and soux vide cooking.  I'd be happy to purchase another if needed. Also makes a great gift for busy people that need a quick meal. Recipes are endless and available online.

  After toying with the idea of buying a food vacuum sealer for years, I finally took the plunge and am so happy I chose this product. My plan was to use it primarily for storing bulk food long term, as my wife and I both love Costco meats but rarely eat enough steak/chicken/pork/salmon to make it worth buying the large quantities. I have used it so far to make vacuum sealed freezer ready portions of all of the above meats. The sealer was easy to use with intuitive buttons and set up, although the instruction manual does spell everything out as well. I also have used it to marinate our meat and holy cow, compared to regular ziplock bags, there is SO much more flavor with vac sealing for the marinade as it allows for constant contact of the flavors. Lastly, I like that the product comes in a nice box which I plan to keep it in when not in use and it fits nicely in one of our bottom cupboards. Overall, highly recommend.

  This machine performs as advertised. I have been a customer of the FoddSaver brand of vacuum sealer since they first came out.  I have had seven of them. My complaint is that last for a year and a half or two years, then they fail to create a vacuum.  I use these machines a lot as I buy in bulk, and sometimes package up 100 to 150 pounds of meat. I decided after last FoodSaver failed halfway through 60 pounds of pork, it would be my last one. I ordered this machine and it arrived on time as promised. It has done exactly as it was advertised. I am going to order an additional machine to take with me when I travel as I take advantage of sales, and need to seal and freeze as I buy.

  This is my first vacuum sealer purchase for myself, but I have plenty of experience using my moms Food Saver brand sealer. A newer, comparable product from the Food Saver brand (the space saving model) has five differences from this Entrige brand.1. This vacuum sealer only requires weight to close the top vs. a large switch that has the “hand squeeze to close” button on the Food Saver brand.2. This vacuum sealer is 2 pounds lighter.3. While the length of this vacuum is about 2 inches longer, it is both shorter and less wide.4. This model has both a “moist” setting for non-dry foods, and a “gentle setting for softer foods like breads and cakes that you don’t want smushed flat.  The Food Saver brand only has one setting.  (But honestly, who has cake sitting around long enough for the need to store it???  : ))5. The most obvious difference is the price tag. At just half the cost of the Food Saver brand it does just as much, if not more work!Highly recommend this product for anyone to try out!Pictured is the sealer and part of our garden haul this year, regular sized scissors for scale. : )

  My husband has been sealing all of our meat and it works great.  He even sealed all of the already frozen meat that we had in our freezer stored in ziplock bags. He had to experiment with it first because it was sucking all the juice out of the burger and prevented a good seal. He then read the instructions (ha ha) and it was advised to place a paper towel under the meat prior to sealing and it worked great after we gave it a try.  This is a great investment and I am happy that we chose this one. (I read so many reviews of others and I selected this one because of all the 5 stars, now I know why 5 stars, you get a 30 dollar gift card if you write a review).I did not know about the gift card prior to purchase and I definitely would give it 5 stars even without the gift card !!

  I first ordered a cheaper brand than this one and immediately regretted it and returned it and then tried this one. Because I came from a crappy one with crappy instructions this one feels like a miracle! Soooo easy to use and the instruction manual is very thorough and detailed and gives great suggestions and makes everything so easy to do! It also taught me something amazing...that cooked meat when vacuum sealed can last 10-15 days in the fridge!!! 😱😱😱. It came with this beautiful cloth and the suction tube for accessories and a small starter assortment of bags. It works fast and well and if something doesn’t hold its seal just read their manual and they’ll tell you why! Most likely user error (fold in seam, food particles blocking seam etc). It’s also an attractive appliance so you can leave it on your counter for easy use. I bought it for long term food storage but after reading their manual I see that I will be using it daily for fridge items! Worth every penny. Don’t bother with cheaper ones from China, you get what you pay for.

  The scale works nice. I just did some calibration checks and the measurements look quite good. The lock function is quite usefull (mainly because I bought the scale to check the poundage of my bow) and it locks the measurement after 2s (but the scale needs to be steady). And, I thought the material of the scale strong. Just for completeness I attached 2 graphs showing its performance... in overall, it seems to have about 4% of discrepancy with the real weight.

  I love this hat. It fits like a traditional baseball cap. I hate when hats have that extra space at the top and make your head look extra long. This one doesn’t do that. The thing I love most is the Velcro strap. I have natural hair, super thick, curly, and susseptable to losing moisture. Because of this, it’s more susseptable to breakage and every time I wear a hat with a Velcro strap it gets caught in the Velcro and rips at my hair. Idk how to describe it but the strap on this doesn’t have regular Velcro. It doesn’t rip my hair! So awesome.

  This is a really doofy saggy hat. Apparently I might have a tiny head like beatlejuice, because this hate is gigantic on my head. I had to pull the strap all the way at the end but it wont hold because there is no more velcro there. cap is also too deep I can put my ears under it. If you have a huge head maybe this cap is for you. I measured my head and its 23 inches, 7/38 which is considered a large head in the size chart. So idk what else to say.......I am really having a hard time finding a decent fitting running cap : /

  I don’t know if this was mentioned in other comments but I hate how if you need to make the hat smaller using the adjustable strap, the excess strap just out stupidly because it’s on the outside of the hat.I have an averaged sized head and I needed to adjust the back by about 1/2” and having a 1/2” piece of adjustable strap jutting out from the hat looks really dumb. I loved the material of the hat and besides the back part it does look good. If you don’t need to adjust the size it’d be a fine hat.

  I have a big head. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. But it is what it is. That said, its not a huge head. According to Goorin's size measurement, I'm ""large"" not ""extra large."" Yet I have been endlessly disappointed by running hats. I've bought a bunch of wicking fabric running hats, from underarmor and other similar companies. Even at fully extended, they don't fit comfortably on my head. Too tight. If I loosen them any further, there's no more velcro to connect.Not so with this beauty of a hat. I'm wearing it right now, with the theading hook set at just about the midway point of the velcro. And there's plenty of room to go, in case my head gets any bigger! (not that I expect that to happen).Besides that, lets just talk about the quality of the build. Compared to the other hands, this thing is just a beast. Its stitched so well, its light, and its visually stylish.I'm a convert. Adidas hats forever. Well done Germany! Your companies make sportswear for real human beings with real heads.

  The good reviews here are pretty accurate. The cap is definitely lightweight, well ventilated, well constructed with nice material, and fits well on a guy’s head. The Velcro adjustment strap is the finer, smoother type that some people described here. Well worth the money.

  Fits fine when the velcro works. But yeah, haven't really owned any clothing that used velcro in awhile. Forgot how it, you know, loses its ability to stick to itself after awhile, kind of rendering it useless for running (maybe that's fine if you aren't moving around getting a bit of wind resistance, I don't know). I guess that's my bad for buying something with velcro that's near your hair, but then again, that's a terrible design decision so, menos puntos.Also doesn't really look great to be honest. Stains very easily and per adidas standard, the logo will peel off fairly quickly after washing (yes, you can wash ""cold"" to delay this a bit, but it's still going to come off).

  Lovely!! I was worried that it would hurt becuase I’ve been using the other kind before, and they really bruised me. But this hula-hoop was much better, I could adjust the weight of it, make it just right for me so it would not hurt while it doesn’t fall! I am getting a lot of fun out of it and starting to get more exercise. BTW, the massage nobs are brilliant, very comfortable.

  Amazing! Super easy to assemble,  and once you get in the groove, it's so easy! I just throw on a show and do it for the length of the show. Instructions say to do it for at least 30 minutes.

  I provided pictures so all of you can see how much of a difference there is between the half gallon (black) and the gallon (aqua). They are both Giotto. These bottles come equipped with a sturdy lanyard which make the bottle stupendously easy to carry around. The bottle itself is freezer and dishwasher friendly. I would definetly suggest if you are trying to drink more water or just need a jug to take to the gym, zumba or running. Both the bottles arrived in time and I had no problems whatsoever with the seller or with shipping. Thank you Giotto

  It's as big as my baby lol I love it. I needed to stay on top of drinking water because Im breastfeeding and I wasn't getting in enough water. This bottle has been a life saver and I have been able to drink enough water and feel hydrated throughout the days. Its very well made and does not leak. I love the fun colors. I'm planning on getting one for my husband! I definitely recommend.

  First of all, a gallon water bottle is huge. I know a gallon is a lot of water-but dang. I posted a pic of it next to a regular athletic water bottle for perspective.I am updating my review because I have to say that the seller really worked with me to make this product right. I was initially very frustrated because the straw wasn't working (at all). Turns out that the straw with my bottle. However, the seller sent me a replacement and with the correct straw, this bottle is really great! I love the paracord handle, very durable and easy to carry (especially when I am carrying other things or bags). My kids love it as well. I definitely drink more water on the days I use this bottle.

  Purchased on 10/22. Rec'd 10/24.LOVE the purple color!! It is BIG, but it's a Gallon. I expected that. It's 14 Inches TALL. 17.5 Inches AROUND the bottle just below the top at the 7AM mark.I already carry another gallon jug so it is not too heavy for me. LOVE the coiled handle. Seems very strong and comfortable to carry. Does NOT scratch skin on fingers. Like the LOCKING lid. Very convenient. I wash it by hand, so don't use a dishwasher. The 2-piece STRAW - I'm really NOT SURE WHY it has 2 pieces. It came with BOTH pieces connected. The shorter piece lifts the straw to make it FLUSH with the top opening. The straw does NOT stick out once the lid is opened.  I have to grab it with my fingernails to lift it up JUST A BIT to drink from it. -------------Love the sayings on the side. The times are 7 am, 9, 11, 1pm, 3,5, 7 & 9pm. I don't stay up that late cause I have to be up around 3-4 AM to get to work. SO I start drinking long BEFORE 7:00AM. Nonetheless, I can still tell IF I get the Gallon finished. I finish it in the first 2 days of having it. Third day, not so much.  -----------------It is BIG, and does fit in my 2011 Altima's Console AFTER I remove the cup holder. SEE PICs. It basically fills the WHOLE area of the console. It will be hard to drink from it while I drive as the straw is TOO SHORT to lift OUT of the container.I'd have to use my 14 inch straw for that and even that only has about  1 -1.2 inches above the rim, but I can drink from it. I cannot close the lid with my stainless steel straw in it, but I just leave it on my desk at work and drink. I don't carry it around!. That  would be too much trouble to try to drink from it while 'on the move', IMO.--------------------The TWO PIECE Straw IS strange. I'm NOT sure WHAT the purpose of that is. Does anyone know WHY they make it in TWO pieces???. The little short piece DOES NOT lift it high enough OUT of the top opening to drink from it so I don't know why it's made like this.-----------------I put Mint leaves in a tea bag or in ice cube tray & freeze and put them in the gallon to add some flavor to the water. Helps me drink it faster with a hint of Mint flavor. Lemon makes it taste bitter to me:).CON(s) - ONE that I've found, but I MAY have been the problem. Yesterday when I left work, water was at the 1 PM mark. I put the jug in my tote bag and put it in the car on the front passenger-side floor. While driving home (40mins), the bottle fell over and was lying on its side for that time. When I got home & lifted it up, the side of the tote was wet and some of the carpet on the car's floorboard. SO, I KNOW it leaked. I'm not sure if I was the one that caused it by NOT screwing the lid on tight enough when I got in the car OR if it really did leak on it's own.----------I may test this theory.BUT just know this jug SHOULD BE IN AN UPRIGHT position at all times :):)----------Do LOVE the PURPLE color.Will get another one!! as a backup to keep at home and may keep one in my desk at work. That way I won't have to transport it back & forth.Drink Up people!!!!!!=======================================UPDATE 11/1/2020 -The STRAW - I found another piece of the straw! SO, its a 3 PIECE STRAW!!!It is a TIP that WILL stick out of the top.(It was in the packaging bag & I overlooked it).SO, I updating my Review to include pictures of the tip that sticks up through the top to drink from.Nubian

  This water bottle is of good quality. I knew it would be huge before I bought it but I didn't really realize how huge. When full it weighs 8 lbs, as much as my largest child did at birth. Holding it feels like holding a well-swaddled newborn. There is little chance that you will actually be able to hold it in one hand unless you can palm a basketball. That being said, for someone who has a busy schedule at work and can't get away from my desk for a long time, I anticipate this will improve my ability to stay hydrated when I'm at work. However, if you really want to hold it in one hand probably go for the half gallon instead.

  So I have been wanting to drink more water, and measure my intake. I also thought the jugs with sayings are so cool! I found this jug, and instantly started getting compliments from my kids. So much so I ordered 3 more jugs within the first week! ****3 more**** So I got one for my daughter who loved it and wanted to then join the challenge with me, and one for the bf who only drinks water and is a “workout-aholic”, and third for my ex-husband bc that guy needs to drink anything besides alcohol. LOL These jugs are sturdy, and have been dropped accidentally, but my daughter’s did land just right so the hing on the drinking part broke, and easy to clean. The colors are awesome, and the bungee cord for carrying are amazing!!! I would definitely recommend one for everyone you know!!! We all love our jugs, and have tons of people asking about them!

  OK I like most people I struggle with drinking enough water as a medical assistant wearing a mask all day it’s even harder, but this really keeps you accountable. Not only does it give you motivation, but it also gives you a time limit in which to do it. The bottle itself is beautiful!!! iT doesn’t spill or leak has a straw that bounces up so it’s extremely easy to drink from.  I’ve had to send links to several people wanting to purchase it for themselves. The para cord bracelet handle just makes it 10 times better! I fill up mine  the night before and I usually put strawberries lemon cucumbers whatever and all day it taste amazing. Everybody at work what’s to get one to!  I feel so much better! Buy this bottle you will not regret it

2,SPORTS,SKIP BO Card Game,$7.99,3.0,"
  We LOVE Skip-Bo in our house.  It is really fun and easy, plus it is adaptable.  Almost any number of people can play.Why is it missing two stars?  Because this is the new version and the card appearances are confusing.  I don't know why they changed the back of the cards from the classic look, but the backs of the cards (which all say ""skip-bo"") look remarkably similar to the front of the ""skip-bo"" wild card.  If you look at the picture, you can see that the card under the ""12"" is the ""skip-bo"" wild card, and it looks too different from the numbered cards so it often gets confused for a card that has been accidentally turned over.  I would say this is a minor complaint, but EVERY SINGLE PERSON who has played with us has struggled with this aspect of the game.  A friend found a classic version of the game at a flea market and we all rejoiced because we could play without the skip-bo card confusion.  Like I said, a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.

  My husband and I are senior citizens.  I wish I could buy by the 6 pack as we go through these over time.  We play every other day and it's so much fun.  Of course, there i some random luck involved, but there is strategy in how you manage your piles and judging when to play and when to hold back.  I love that two people can play (not true with many games) and we travel with this and play in doctor's offices and in airports.

  This is an amazing addition to our game collection!  We have over 25 board and card games to supplement our homeschooling efforts.  This one was recommended by a friend whose kids love the game.  My son is 6 and this is an awesome way for him to practice numeracy!  I still help him a lot with the overall game, but he asks for this very often and its especially nice that a lost card or two will not really affect play.  I would recommend this very highly to any family, but especially to homeschooling families who use play as learning.

  I had to add more card to the set as my wife and I play with large stacks to get rid of.  Love this game.  I find it more fun with its just two of us playing as you can really stick it to the other person.  When the 11 year old plays my wife and her try to keep me from winning as I normally win as I am so cut throat.  They don't care about they're stacks as long as it messes with mine.  It's my favorite game of all the games we play.  Each game is different then the last.  The moment you flip a card from your stack it can either be good or bad so the anticipation is enjoyable.  Since you never know what the next card will bring you have to plan ahead and be prepared for anything.  Two 11's in a row... No problem I've got this.

  Extremely disappointed in this. It was not a full deck. There was only 123 out of 160 cards in the deck. Also cards were hand written and pulled from a mismatch decks (not just one either). I have been ripped off 20 for garbage which is where the deck ended up.

  Got this as a Christmas present. Not sure which game came first: SkipBo or Spite and Malice, but this is like a rip off Spite and Malice without quite as much fun. It is still pretty fun, and it is simpler to play than Spite and Malice, but I just kind of feel like there is something missing with this one. Do like the packaging...there is a cardboard tray inside the box that helps keep cards from slipping through the cracks. Why is “For Traveling” a rating category on here??? Sure, it’s easy to take with you and play once you get to your destination, but it definitely couldn’t be played in the car.
"
2,SPORTS,SKIP BO Card Game,$7.99,5.0,"
  One of our favorite games. Easy enough for kids to learn, but challenging enough for adults. Although this looks like Uno, it is not. This game is more like solitaire in a group format. The only thing I would say is that initially we didn’t understand how to play the game. Once we watched a couple YouTube videos it was super easy. Since it’s a compact card game, it’s great game to take on trips. Won’t take up a lot of space in your cabinet like a board game. Plus for us since we have A LOT of games!!
"

  We purchased our original game at a garage sale for a quarter.  The cards were well used.  After a family camping trip where this game was often played, we decided on purchasing a new deck!  Everyone from our 6-year olds to adults loved the game.  Easy to learn, a bit heavy on the luck of the draw but still has a little strategy.  This is now in our ""go-to"" bag of family games.  Even a two player game is fun.  We added a house rule that the colors now matter on the build piles.  Makes it significantly harder and longer but it is a nice change of pace from the normal rules.

  First of all, you cannot beat the price of it. this maybe the best fishing pliers i’ve used in my 12 years fishing career.  im really impressed how well with they are designed and made!  they are lightweight and solid build, comes with a case to protect the pliers, i love the pliers case and lanyard, as many fishmen,i often lose my pliers and lures when i go fishing,but i will never lose my pliers again with them. The pliers is a multi-tool: cut lines,move hook,tie lines,split ring,adjust lures and other accessories .... i used the pliers to cut my 10-30 lbs braided lines, they worked well and no problems. if you're smart enough,you'll find more uses for it and they will improve fishing efficiency.I’ve used those tools in both fresh and salt water, they worked well and holds up on the salt.  In my experience: any metal equipment( including stainless steel) needs to be cleaned with fresh water after used in salt water.this will extend the life of the tools.Im a warm-hearted fisherman and happy to share my experence.Fish on, guys!

  I was ready to immediately send them back if they were not able to cut my very fine 10lb test braid.  These pliers are incredible and did it without any problems.  Very light weight, holes in the grips to cut down on weight and I also use them to hold my hooks tighten up my knots.  The split ring separator works with larger split rings, but not very small ones.  I guess you can use your fingernail for that.  The length of the pliers are good and plenty to get down into the fish mouth to release the hook.  Over all these pliers are fantastic!

  These are very well-made, with excellent fit, finish, and quality.  I like how the faces and cutting edges on the pliers are removable/replaceable, and they come spring-loaded to stay open.  They come in a very nice gift box, and include a ripstop nylon holster for the pliers.  I'm a beginner fisherman buying his first kit, so I'm not sure what to make of the fish holder thing.  However, it is stoutly made and grips my finger enough to convince me that if you held a fish by the lip, the fish wouldn't fall or be able to pull out.  I didn't rate durability, as I've not used them yet.  After a few uses, I'll update this review as needed.

  First trip out and I used them to crimp close a weight which resulted in the tips stretching out and unable to grasp a hook so I tried to adjust them back and they broke.

  Let me preface by saying I'n in my upper 60's. When it came, I put it together in all of about 2 minutes. The knee pad is fine if you keep your knees together. If you put your knees hip width apart, you'll need another pad. No big deal. The pad is just something extra. The push up handles are great for me. When I do them on the floor, my wrists start to hurt quickly. These allow you to keep your wrist straight and you can vary the width and positioning easily to target different muscles and get a little more extension.Now for the roller. It rolls well on hard floors as well as thick carpet. The handles do slip some if you're not careful of your form. I did a few roll outs when I got it and waited until the next day to see if I was sore. Didn't feel much so I tried again the next day. Holy, swear words, Batman, core muscles were extremely sore. What was I thinking, trying this two days in a row? If I can get my stomach muscles back into shape like I want to, this thing will help me do it. I'm not ready yet for the resistance bands, but It's a keeper.

  I've been using ad wheels for about 18 years.  In 2018, I suffered a minor chest injury from lifting weights.  This minor injury made it painful to use ad wheels.  For nearly 2 years, I had not worked out with an ab wheel.  After 2 years I was ready to start using an ab wheel again but I lost a lot of core strength and could not effectively use any wheel.  So, I purchased this ad roller.  The elastic bands were just what I needed to give me the assistance to complete an effective workout.  After about 1 month of using the elastic bands and ad roller, my abs were strong enough to use the ad roller without the elastic bands.  I highly recommend this product for beginner and advanced users.

  Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Yes there were jokes about the certain stationary bike add and gifting a wife exercise equipment. Check back in a year for the diary compilation video.Very quick to assemble with no pinchy bits. The elastic trainer band is very helpful to get started with the wheel. Stick feet in the loops at one end and clip to the wheel handles. As you roll out, the elastic gives enough resistance to keep you from falling flat on your face if you roll too far. Which we all did when we first tried it without the bands.Push up handle bars, who knew. The foam pad around the handle isn't the greatest and I suspect will break down pretty quickly, but the push up experience is better with them.Knee pad won't get used. Workout room already has foam floor. If you have a hardwood floor, probably will be helpful.Summary: she liked the gift.

  These are classic, tried and true workout tools that have been around for a while. They are good to have in the workout room. They are simple yet effective. The push-up bars give a great extension for positive results that and the ab roller really works as it should. Both are great strength and muscle builders for shoulders, chest, arms, lats and abs. They are not easy, but through determination and effort over time, you will see results. Add them to your workouts. Push yourself.

  This abdominal roller is nice and let me tell you It WORKS AND WORKS WELL. I am in pretty good shape and I was sore as hell from following the included workout instructions for about a day or two. This thing is NO JOKE! Came boxed nicely, all parts good quality, easily assembled. I can’t see it taking very long to strengthen your abdominal core with this thing. Nice soft knee pad, but it moves around too much in my opinion. If you’re not serious about getting in shape don’t buy this because this thing WILL whip your ass and your friends may ask you....”why you cry?”

  Was looking for an ab roller and saw this one that came with push up bars and went with it. Roller works as expected though I find that it's a little hard on the hands if you're not wearing padded gloves. Pad is fine and the bands are a nice touch, though I don't use them.Oddly enough, I'm most happy with the push up bars. Now that I'm working out from home due to COVID with minimal equipment, I use the push up bars often. The added range of motion makes the workout a little better and also the neutral hand position is key for me since I have carpal tunnel. The set was a nice addition for my home workouts. So glad I acquired enough home equipment over the years to get decent workouts at home now that gym's are closed.

  This review is for the KEVENZ 50-Pack KEVENZ 3-Star 40mm White Table Tennis Balls,Advanced tournament Ping Pong Balls (Tournament ping-pong Ball).I started off not looking to buy 50 but when you look at the price compared to buying a smaller number it just made more sense.  The balls bounce true and work as expected.  All 50 balls came shipped in a box that is now doubling at the storage bin.  None were damaged on arrival.  We keep it the storage bin next to the ping pong table and when a ball goes flying out of play or gets lost the kids just reach and grab a new one.  Once a week or so I go and pick up all the ""lost"" ones and put them back in the storage bin.  .I'm the type who does a lot of review and comparison before making a purchase.If you found my review helpful please like it.  Thanks!

  Have a slightly tackier feel to them than the more expensive big brand balls. The weight and size is on par...the balls bounce well. So if you are OK with the tackier feel (better spin because of grip, if you ask me) than that of the smoother balls, get these. What a great deal. 5/5

  Great table tennis balls. My only regret is not getting the 100 pack. We use these for our home table and our family has some table tennis players who take their game and trash talking very seriously. If you are in that sort of environment (family, frat house, etc) with very serious and competitive types, you can't go wrong with these.

  I had bought this brand before from Amazon and thought it would be the same, but this item was cheaper and not the same quality as the one I got last time. Seems flimsy and doesn't have the same bounce. See images for comparison.. the one on the left is the more recent purchase, the one on the right is the older purchase (ITTF approved).

  They're table tennis balls.  They're bright, round, and durable, unlike some balls that crack easily.  The green print on the balls makes is easier for me to track spin than the black print on another brand of orange balls I own, so that's a plus.These balls are perfect for a recreation-level table tennis player like me.

  You can never have too many ping pong balls. And if you play table tennis with kids, you can double that advice. These are solid balls that bounce and spin well. They have a crisp feel off the paddle, and ping smartly off of the table. They also stand up to wicked spikes and hard forehand slams.I’m an amateur player, and I like these balls. At .20 cents each, they are a decent value for a 40mm ball. You can keep the game moving without having to constantly retrieve balls. For 10 bucks, it’s a good buy for 50 balls.

  This is a good pack of balls..  Round, orange, smooth, bouncy, and consistent.  I don't have much to compare it to and I'm just a novice player but they work fine for me and the guys at work.  We lose a lot of balls so a 50 pack was perfect.

  What a great price for these balls.  Around $.20 a piece, which is probably 5-10 times cheaper than buying a pack of 3 at a random store.  The balls themselves are a good color orange, are spherically symmetrical (you'd think that should be a given, but those cheaper balls are not very spherical, especially 1-star balls), and are a good hardness to give some weight to your games.  After several games of smashing the balls you might crack them, but they last a long time.  Will buy these again if I ever end up breaking them all.

   I have bought several of these cameras and I will give you the pro's and cons.  Con's first if you buy one expect to return it until you get one that works properly.  Yup took four times to get an actual working camera.  First two put batteries in made a squealing noise and wouldn't work...returned for a replacement twice the second time they would not send me another just refunded my money...Ok ordered one from another vendor.  That one tested good put it out in the field and it went through a set of batteries in the first night.  Returned and got my latest one...so far so good.  I have high end cameras also but for the price point this one when it works does a pretty good job.  Video is stellar, sound is almost non existent unless the animal is right next to the camera.  I like the wide angle too.  I have one in the field that is still going strong after a year of daily use. So if you are looking for a cheaper trail camera this will suit you. I have attached a video for ya of my resident bobcat.  Hope this helps

  My unit clicks like it is rapidly snapping pictures while in the setup mode and there is nothing in the manual about this happening.  I have asked Campark two times what is going on with this and do I have a bad unit.Absolutely no reply.  There was a letter in the box crying the blues about their business needing positive revues on Amazon, but they are not living up to their obligations.

  I wanted a trail cam and wanted to spend under $100. Research and reading reviews led me to purchase the CamPark T45A. So far it has not disappointed. Everything works as intended and the videos and photos are quite clear and good looking even in the les HD settings. The controls are pretty easy to use and the manual easy enough to understand. I love the LCD screen built in for viewing what you have captured on the spot. ANY complaints would be that I wish the sensors were a little more sensitive at distances beyond 10'  and page 15 of the instruction manual was printed blurry.

  I bought this camera to find out what critter keeps digging holes behind my bushes and digging up my mulch. I also wanted to check out what other critters might be lurking in the night. The only issue I had was in reading the instruction booklet. The writing is very small. The diagram uses numbers to point to the camera features, but the numbers a white inside a tiny tiny black dot. I literally had to use a magnifying glass to see the numbers. If the instruction booklet would have had a bigger font, I would have given my overall rating a 5 instead of a 4.

  These cameras work great! I have 2 of the previous version and just recently purchased the 2021 upgrade because I scratched the sensors on my older one! I had scratched them pretty bad so I wanted to be sure I didn't miss anything. These take very good night photos and video.

  I was super worried about this but I am SO happy I decided to buy it anyways. I’m 5’8, a size 14-16, and I wear a 36DD. I’m definitely not thin but also not all that big, so I bought an XL to be safe and it fit great!! It is definitely snug as advertised but not unflattering or uncomfortable, and I don’t feel like I’m in a sausage casing. I was worried it would be too short but was again pleasantly surprised; the shirt hit right at my waist which is what I wanted. If you’re wearing this casually you won’t have to worry about it rolling up, but if you’re exercising I can see it rolling a bit depending on what you’re doing and what your body type is. Overall very happy and now waiting for all the other colors to be back in stock in my size :)

These tops fit perfectly (I’m 5’6, 135lbs, ordered a small). The colors are clean and gorgeous, exactly how they look in the photos. There is a built in bra with padding so you won’t see any... peeking. I’m a personal trainer and needed something that I could workout in, then throw a sweater over during training. I really couldn’t be any happier! Can easily be used as workout clothing, or even be dressed up for a night out.

  The BEST basic tank! I have this in 3 colors (white, black, and a salmon/pink) and I’m reordering the white because I wear it so much! I am 5’8”, 155-160lbs, usually wear a small or medium top, and wear a 34C - I got the medium and it fits perfectly and makes the girls look amazing! The built in bra and pads are great so you can just throw this on with a pear of jeans, shorts or leggings for the warmer weather and go! I also wear it for working out and it keeps everything in place.

The size is perfect to me , easy to fold up and spreading, doesn't accupied much space. Good quality! The surface of the bench feels comfortable and it doesn't slipped when you sit on top to do exercise. Although it have a little bit smell, I think the smell will dissapear after a couple day. It doesn't matter because it is a new equipment. I like it can adjustable any altitude that you want. I hope this bench can urge me to stick at exercise. when I see it, I'll remember to that I have to move, which is less time and less money than going to the gym.

  The foot holds are so poorly designed and equally poorly placed, they are non-functional.  The foot holds are far too small for a person of average size and weight to use.  They are also fixed so close to the bench's structural beams, there is no useful or practical way to anchor one's feet while exercising. I am very disappointed and would appreciate a replacement bench which is more satisfactorily designed and crafted.UPDATE:  Flybird customer service representative, ""Dena,"" was exceptionally accommodating and responsive.Dena considered my initial feedback regarding the poorly designed and equally poorly placed foot holds on the original bench the company sent.Within a couple days, Dena shipped me a replacement bench which was considerably sturdier and noticeably better designed than the original.I was dually impressed by the level of customer service Dena provided and am satisfied with the replacement bench Flybird provided at no additional cost.

  This workout bench is not bad at all for its price and capabilities. It can incline and decline to the most comfortable angle that you will like. I need an adjustable bench, but there wasn't a single space, I just put it in my bedroom, and this fit perfectly. It's strong. It is safe and not to shake during exercise. The cushion is long and comfortable which is enough me. The leg holder bar is reliable when I use this bench for sit-ups, it can be removed. The bench has a plastic cover on its leg so that no matter how I moved it, it wouldn't scratch my floor. This is great. I use it every day to exercise. I am satisfied with my purchase.

  I read the reviews before I bought this bike. The reviews are accurate. The instructions are confusing. The tension levels could be stronger. Seat is uncomfortable. It's a good price for a starter bike. It gets my heart rate up.In the instructions there are three different sized bolts. Two are the same size in the pictures of the instructions. Instructions say to get a ruler out to measure the bolts. Why can't they show small, medium, and large bolts in the instructions? Not hard for them to show three actual sizes in the book. The drawinJust like other reviewers I ended up tossing the instructions to the side and figuring it out on my own.Someone else mentioned the tension levels could be better. I agree. Level 8, the last level, is about how it feels riding a street bike on level pavement.Yes the seat is uncomfortable. Bike seats just are. But in time I should get used to it. If you want a comfortable seat get a recumbent bike.This bike is a great price for what it is. This is my first stationary bike and was not willing to spend too much on my first one. It does get my heart rate up where I wanted it using levels 6 through 8. I know I will eventually out grow this bike and want more in a bike but for the price it is a great starter bike.

  I ordered the mid range model for the timer and speedometer/odometer… None of which work properly. The timer has a gain of at least two seconds per minute and the speedometer/odometer are incredibly generous (currently telling me I’m riding over 20 miles an hour). Within the first day the belt jumped and I had to disassemble the entire bike and figure out how to rethread the belt. All in all the bike has been disassembled/reassembled twice so far (once by my mechanic)....there is currently quite a noise coming from the front belt tension spring - meaning I will be taking this apart again. I would not recommend this for anyone needing to keep up with marathon, cycling or triathlon training - though if affordability is your key necessity BUY this bike. I would heartily recommend this bike to the average person who does not need accurate measurements. This planter-fasciitis-grounded-runner will be spending many an hour riding this thing… until gyms reopen.

What even is going on here?!UPDATE:Turns out all the parts were in fact included. I only figured this out after a trip to the hardware store when the bolts I picked up were to short. There was included bolts that did fit, they were mislabeled in the instructions as well as the packaging.Bike is pretty good so far now. Really quiet, and the seat is a lot more comfortable than I expected. Four stars because of the confusion.

  I assembled this product by myself despite the instructions suggesting two people tackle it. I kept the original box and used it to prop up some parts of the bike during assembly which was not overly difficult even by myself. I'm 71"" tall and have a 32"" inseam; and even with the seat-post extended to its maximum safe length, there is a noticeable bend in my knee when the pedal is in the lowest part of its revolution. While I do not find this to be particularly undesirable, I prefer a more extended reach with my legs while exercising. The best part of this machine is the magnetic resistance feature which isn't overly difficult even on the highest setting, yet still provides consistent and smooth resistance. The machine does not require electrical power to operate (except for the monitor which requires batteries), and the magnetic resistance mechanism when in operation is nearly silent. The bike itself does not take up much floor space and can be used even if tucked into a corner of a room. I bought this exercise machine to replace an older elliptical-trainer which required electrical power, took up twice as much space and was loud while in operation. Overall, I really like the function and performance of this exercise bike. Well worth the money when purchased by those with appropriate height and leg-length.

  I think this is a good product for the price, it was easy to put the pieces together, the bike does its work, although I wouldn't recomend this product to an overweight person, I weigh 120lb and the bike moves a little bit when I am on it and my husband weighs 191lb and he uses it too. I would recomend also to buy a cushion seat for the bike as the one it brings it is pretty uncomfortable...
"
2,SPORTS,Marcy Magnetic Upright Bike,$219.99,2.0,"
  The rest of the bike is fine, but the seat is EXCRUCIATING. It's like sitting on a metal pole, so I physically could not endure using the bike for more than 30 seconds as it came. Actually, a metal pole may have been more comfortable. I bought a padded gel seat cover, which made it tolerable, though it's still uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. If I want to continue to use it, I think I need to invest in a whole new seat.

  Package arrived and it was very obvious someone had opened, tried to assemble, gave up and returned the unit.  Bolts were missing.  Had to go to home depot to buy parts to put this together.  Very sad that I paid for a new bike yet got rejected unit that had to be fixed to work - some pre-assembled work by former owner wasn't done correctly .  However, I picked this unit because it was small and quiet and it is both of those things and I will love using it.

  The bike is great for the price. However the directions are not clear, the base parts front & back holes for the screws did not line up, so I had to put the back on the front..& issues with cable.if I was not mechanically inclined it would have been very difficult, still took awhile to put together.....

  Well, im as skeeptical as they come; i bought these gloves due to my very painful arthrtis in my hands that often keeps me awake nights. I have read about compression and copper and how there is no scientific proof as to its pain relieving qualities; however I had become desperate for relief. When I received them I put them on that very evening while watching TV. As the night went on my hands felt betterbut I didnt give the gloves nuch credence. I have now been wearing them each night for the last week and am convinced they have made a difference in my level of pain and discomfort. I dont understand how they work or if its just psychological but I'll take it! I would have given 5 stars but its only been a week. If it continues toelp I will come back and update.Make sure if you order these that you get the proper size and measure your hands as they instruct. If you guess you could get the wrong size and lose any benefit you would otherwise receive. Its critical to the success of the gloves. Thanks and good luck to you!

  I bought these gloves in hope that they would help with my arthritis. I have been wearing them for a couple weeks now and I am sad to say the have a rip in the seem between the wrist and the thumb. I am hoping the Copper Compression Company sees this and can help me replace them.Other than the seam rip the gloves are very comfortable and are the perfect fit.UPDATEI received an email right from one of the company owners. He was very apologetic and took care of the problem right away.I recommend these gloves as I have been wearing them for almost two months and I feel a difference for sure.Great customer service!

  I’m 30 and have fibro, and lately have been waking up with stiff, swollen and painful hands. I also have Raynauds Symdrome and its winter so that may play into this issue as well.. the gloves, when worn to bed, actually do prevent much of the pain the next morning. I was very surprised. These are also very comfortable, I got a different pair as a gift and those ones have a seam on the thumb that literally rubbed my thumb joint raw in one night! Took days to heal and I never wore those gloves again. These ones rock! Comfort, compression (gentle)  and ride of pain.ill take it!

  I received these gloves December 15, 2018 and could see that the quality was poor. The stitching on the middle finger of the left hand glove was coming unraveled.

  Very compressed and snug.  Drove all over looking around stores for something and found something even better with these gloves.  Hand feels virtually pain free as long as gloves are worn.  Broke right hand months back and these gloves makes post surgery recovery sooner.  Im already out playing basketball and I play with these gloves on.  I feel instant comfort as soon as gloves go on. Use chart to measure. Size is specific and I go from size M-L with these gloves.  I measure L and they fit perfect.  I was curious so I ordered a size M and they fit smaller and more snug and compressed without any discomfort.  I wear the size M when I play Basketball or any other sport for the more compressed feel.  However it does feel tight around the fingers with the M size.  So size L is perfect size for me.  Again, these gloves are size specific, measure carefully..

  Bought these gloves because I'm a pianist who performs 3 hours a night, 6 nights a week.  And lately had some torn ligaments.... ive worn these 24/7 For the last month.  I wash my hands like normal,  shower in them, ect...  I'm 31 years old and was extremely skeptical... But to my surprise,  the pain in my hands during performances was eliminated... honestly I'm afraid to take them off.  20 bucks is less than a dollar a day... So they're a good value.... ive literally changed the wheel bearings on my motorcycle,  worked on 2 friends cars,  changed the oil in my truck and various other stuff over the last month and they've held up well...  It's time for another pair,  as now i can see the copper had started to dissipate in the knuckles,  and there's a small tear pictured....

  I've been using these gloves for a while now and they really seem to help with the pain and swelling. I've got arthritis in my right hand and had a major flare up back in May. Nothing really seemed to help with the swelling until I got these gloves. It's taken a while, but most of the swelling has finally gone down. I really like to use these gloves while I drive long distance and am on the computer. My hand gets very achy during these times. If I wear the gloves while I'm doing either of these tasks, I notice that my hand doesn't ache very much by the end of the day. I just ordered a couple of more pairs so that I can always keep one at my desk and one in my car. I'm still using the other 2 pairs that I bought months ago so they're are holding up nicely. In my opinion, the quality of these gloves is very good.

  First let me say I have very bad wrist pains, arthritis. I was issued wrist braces from my Dr. and they are good at immobilizing my wrist, but dang near impossible to type correctly in.  These compression glove have helped with both of my concerns. I am able to type better with the gloves and they are great for pain relief.  Keep in mind these are compression gloves so they should not be loose, use care when putting on and off. I have been using them for about two + weeks. I use them the entire time at work and at home when my wrist begin to hurt, and I do get relief. I also sleep with them on from time to time and my wrist feel good in the morning. Now if your fashion savvy, well I do look like a dork walking around in business work / casuals work cloths with black gloves with fingers exposed.One co-worker referred to me as Chuckie from Sons of Anarchy....they guy with only index and thumbs...ok I digress..Great glove, works, CustomerCare is top notch, definitely give them a chance to fix any issues you may run across, only fair since they pride themselves on quality, care and customer satisfaction. Would I recommend yes highly.Hope this helps this helps some of you out there.From E

2,SPORTS,Callaway 2021 Supersoft Golf Balls 12B PK,$22.99,5.0,"
  I am a male golfer in my 60's, generally hitting 210-220 off the tee, and shooting in the mid 80's. I like to hit orange balls, which I can track in the sky and find on the ground easiest. Before these balls, I went back and forth between the previous generation Supersoft and orange Titleist Velocity balls.I liked the Titleist better off the tee, and would usually get about 10 yards more. But I liked the Supersofts everywhere else, as they seemed to come off my irons with more energy, and were friendlier on and around the greens. I tended to use the Titleists on long courses, and the Supersofts on shorter tracks.The new 2021 Supersofts have changed things completely. They are every bit the equal of the Titleist Velocity off the tee now, and I have had to club down with my irons. These things seem to explode off my irons - I haven't hit a ball this far with my irons since before my shoulders wore out. For reference, my average 7 iron hit increased from 135 yards to about 145. The new Supersofts fly just as straight as the previous model. They seem a bit softer on the green though, and I find myself having to putt a little harder to get the same roll.The ball seems just a little shinier than the previous generation - maybe a tiny bit less of a matte finish. The dimples seem more pronounced and deeper, though that might just be a side effect of different finish. The surface feel is slightly different too. It's hard to describe exactly - maybe slightly soapy? It isn't unpleasant - not tacky or slimy - just a little different than before.I couldn't be more pleased with the new Supersofts. No more choosing between the Callaways and Titleists for me - this round goes to the Supersoft.

  I wanted to try narrowing down my choice of golf balls. I decided to give these a try. Off the tee they certainly have a zing to them. They carry well and offer great feedback. Balls like the high end 3 and 4 piece balls just have that woody feel to them that I'm not into. These feel great and really fly and give you some distance. They won't correct your curve to your swing or make you hit like a pro. They offer great roll after your carry in the air. However, that roll is where they struggle on your approach shots. It's a bit of a struggle in that regard, isn't it? You need the distance to make the green but then the ball just wants to keep that momentum. You'll reach the green but the ball likes to keep rolling. I have had a hard time getting them to stop. So, I usually switch balls for my approach shots to a higher compression ball with more spin.Good balls, not great. Well worth the price though. You won't spend 30 minutes searching for one if it goes far off line.

  The golfball itself in my opinion is very good.  It comes off the club extremely soft and takes off like a bullet.  I have bought the Matte Green, the Matte Orange , the Matte Red, and the Yellow.  I am very satisfied with the over all quality of them.  The only one I really don't care for are the RED ones.  Don't get me wrong, they are still great balls, but the only issue I have with them is the fact they are extremely hard to follow.  Once it leaves the club and you lift your head to follow it, it's difficult to pick it up In the air and see where it is going and where it lands.  Unless you're playing with a partner or in a group, you may lose more of these compared to the other BRIGHTER colors due to not seeing where it is going.  Even the ORANGE are a little difficult to follow some times, but not nearly as bad as the RED.  Take my advice and go with the MATTE GREEN, definitely the best choice all around.  I am returning the 3 dozen RED boxes and want to exchange them for the GREEN.  But not all is lost with the RED ones, they can still be used if you only want to use them for chipping practice in the yard or around practice greens.  Hope this helps others when it comes time to buy them.

  Picked these up to replace my dwindling supply of Titleist DT trusoft and I must say they play very similarly.  Nice soft touch around the green and good feel off irons/woods.  I consider myself an improving hacker so I don't feel I get the benefit of a premium ball, for my these worked very nicely and gave me the feel on the short game that I look for.  I'll probably keep gaming them in the future.

  Well I got these because they are red and I'm hoping to easily be able to find when golfing, as I have never actually played a 9-hole yet. Only reason I'm giving these a four-star is because they are red (ish) lol because of the matted finish they're kind of like a pinkish red color. I was just sort of hoping for a solid red to dark red. But other than that I look forward to using them

  My go to golf balls. These are Perfect for me. The bright orange color really helps make them visible on the course. Plus most people hit a white golf ball so the likelihood of someone mistaking your ball for theirs is pretty much nonexistent.

I would not recommend this.UPDATE: After seeing this review the owner of the company reached out to me and sent a replacement right away.  We have had this replacement for about 3 weeks and it appears to be holding up much better as it has not broken at all.

  I cannot review the actual product, though I would like to praise the company. Last week I’d ordered one punching bag as a birthday gift for my great-nephew, but due to co-vid19 the grandparents are unable (as of yet) to get the gift to him. However, just today I received an email from the company stating that due to the pandemic  whoobli wants to give a little joy to children who are being cooped up. They asked me to choose a child of my choice for them to send a free punching bag to, so that the child can have a little indoor fun. It wasn’t a contest. It wasn’t a BOGO or a sales ploy. It was an after the fact, good from the heart gesture from a company I will be sure to deal frequently with again.

  Ours boys (2yo and 4yo) have recently been watching the 1990s cult classic Three Ninjas. We needed to find a way to help them release their energy after watching the movie, so my sister purchased this punching bag. The boys absolutely loved it and were playing with it non-stop after it came in. The product seemed super durable, including the gloves that came with it, so we were really excited about them being able to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, we believe we received a defective product because the bag popped off the top after two days of use. I contacted the seller about replacement and was immediately contacted back. They were willing to replace it and then some for our inconvenience. They setup another order to be shipped the same day I contacted them and told me not to worry about sending back the defective product to lessen any further inconvenience to me. I've never received such great customer service from a company and was overwhelmed by their generosity! We will continue to buy products from them in the future due to their top notch customer service and their fun products!

  I bought this for my grandsons birthday. Since he lives over a 1000 miles away I've never seen it. A few days after I bought it,the company sent an email saying since the nation is going through such a hard time they'd like to reach out and do something to help and offered another punching bag to any child I'd like to send it to. This ACTUALLY brought me to tears. It was the first kind words I'd heard in many months.  I had it sent to my other grandson- his brother. My daughter says they do use them,I ask. One bag doesn't stay inflated. Dont know what she means because I've never seen them.she says it's not a problem, they reinflate it. And then they dont fight for turns. This company is special.  I wanted something to keep my kids active while being stuck inside. To burn off some energy so they dont make my daughter crazy who is working from home. Sounds like this helps alot !

  Pros+ Very durable for the price, we had bought a similar product which was around the same price and that one broke almost instantly. This product is still going strong.+ When you fill the base with water it is very stable, I was concerned it would topple over.+ My kids love it, they literally fight over who gets to have a go.+ The boxing gloves are awesome!Cons- You have to set it up. It is pretty easy to set up but I would have loved something you can just pull out of the box and it’s good to go.- The plug was difficult to put into the stand.Overall very happy with my purchase.

Thank you for the wonderful and professional customer service.I was really disappointed at the quality of the actual bag. No matter how much I pumped, it wouldn't inflate.

  It's a great set! Easy to assemble within 10 minutes, all the parts were there, and ready to use quickly. It's tough enough for my 7 year old to punch hard. We used water in the base and haven't had an issue with it falling over. You could add sand if needed. This was purchased as a gift for our 7 year old son who loves to pretend fight everything in the living room thanks to the Avengers. We are hoping to give the pillows and couch a break. He was excited to get his own ""punching gloves, "" but switches between them and hulk fists. I do not recommend punching without gloves at first. If they accidentally punch low, the base of the bag is metal and doesn't feel great on the knuckles.

  Our 8 year old son plays travel ball and always likes to wear eye black.  This is the second one I've purchased.  It goes on nice and thick, comes off easily with makeup remover (I use micellar water).  The only thing you have to be careful of is if it's hot outside.  We live in Georgia and it gets very hot down here.  I had it in my purse and it melted, luckily I had it in a plastic bag.  Overall, you can't beat it for the price.  Will definitely purchase more once this runs out.  They last a long time.

  Got this stuff for my 1st grade football team that I am coaching.  The kids are pumped when I put this on them before the game.  I have used it on 10 kids for 3 games so far and there is still plenty left.  Definitely comes off around the 2nd or 3rd quarter, but hey, what do you expect?

  I first bought this product as a single roll at a nation wide popular drug store and I was very impressed with it all around. I then thought that I could save some money by buying the white medical tape, also at that same national chain, but I found out that the white stuff doesn't adhere anywhere nearly as good as this tan waterproof tape. So I decided to buy more of the tan water proof tape, but I found out that if I buy a 6 pack of it on amazon, the price per roll was much cheaper than what it cost for a single roll at the brick and mortar national location. So I bought at amazon. The first thing that I noticed after I opened my amazon package was that the 6 pack of tape came in clear plastic shrink wrap without any disposable identification that this was a Nexcare prouct, but I did see on the inside cardboard roll that the tape is wrapped around does have the same logo as what I bought at the national chain pharmacy. However, what I noticed was that it didn't seem to stick quite as well and it actually seems like the 6 pack tape is actually thinner than what's sold at the national chain store. When I wrap the 6 pack tape more tightly it does stick though. But I was wondering if this was a knock off or whether Nexcare was selling this tape on amazon with slightly less dense material. All in all though it does seem to hold up, but if I was going on vacation and going to need tape that may get wet (currently I'm not using it to go into water), like in a pool or ocean, I would probably want to bring at least one roll of the other stuff just to be sure.

  I ordered this tape and quickly found out the adhesive is inferior. I applied it to my skin & it ""almost"" fell off on it's own.  Outer surface may be waterproof, but what good is it if it will not adhere to your skin. Hell...I even applied two pieces together & found pulling them apart was effortless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

  So thankful to have found this stuff! Read a trick about taping two toes together when wearing heels and this tape works perfectly. It is waterproof and cushioned. I also put a small patch on my heel where I usually get blisters and this tape completely prevented it. Wish I knew about this stuff ages ago. Amazing!ETA: just repurchased to help keep a very deep cut (in hindsight, probably needed stitches...oops!) on my finger clean and dry. Worked like a CHARM! Held the bandage in place and kept the cut dry. Will never go without this stuff!

  Don't mind my hair or tired look, I am a nurse and have been working on a COVID unit since the pandemic started. For over a year of wearing masks for 12+ hours I began building calluses and pressure injuries around my face, mainly nose bridge and cheek bones. It's gotten to the point where I've had incurable acne on these areas no matter what I did.I started wearing bandaids on my face but they would slide off and I needed to exchange them frequently. So I sought to find something that would protect my face and stay in place for 12+ hours and I came across this beauty.This picture was taken in the driveway of my home after a 12 hour shift. These definitely stay in place regardless and sweat and tears. Excuse my attire, I change outside my car after every shift and take off my surgical cap, which explains the messy hair. But this goes to show this adhesive foam tape works wonders!My face is clearing up and my acne is finally calming down. It's not gone, but it's definitely improved thanks to this tape. I also have very sensitive skin, which explains my breakouts and skin break down. But this tape is definitely safe for sensitive skin. Thank goodness for this tape. Would definitely buy again!

  This was the least expensive product that I purchased to cover a recent surgical scar, yet proved to be the best. The other kinds I bought that said they were waterproof etc, in fact were not. This tape stays secure most of the day, preventing the sun from discoloring the scar. It works well while in water, but not all day. For a day at the beach I replace it maybe 2 times. Not a huge inconvenience as it stays on in the water. I would definitely recommend. Also great for blisters/ shoe rubbing

  I am beyond happy with this product.  I have a Treager grill and had been trying my hand at cold-smoking cheeses using their method, which is a pan of cheese in a pan of ice in the grill on the smoke settings.  It was a major pain to try to keep the temperature anywhere close to right.  I bought this smoker tube and and made a temporary modification to the grill to defeat the hot rod and the auger and just use the fan.  Found out that the Treager will shut the fan of if the temperature is below a preset temperature for over 10 minutes.  Again, a headache trying to keep is going for several hours.  I finally backed off the over-thinking and simply put the smoking tub on the drip pan close to the opening where the grease drains.  There was plenty of air available to keep the pellets smoking.  The ambient temperature of the smoke was relatively constant and in the 87 to 95 degree range.  When the temperature got over 90, I simply put a 4 x 8-inch baking dish on the grate directly over the tube and threw a handful of ice cubes in it.  The temperature was back to 90.  I filled the tube with pellets and it is still going after three hours.  Forget Treager's advice on how to cold smoke cheese;  put this tube in the grill and the job is done.

  The UPS guy showed up about 3pm and I ran to the freezer, grabbed a sirloin and some haddock fillets.  It was a rush job, thawed the steak in the waver, thawed the fillets in warm water as they were shrink wrapped.  I had my wood pellets purchased from last year. I filled the tube, tried to light it on the stove indoors.  BAD IDEA!  Filled the kitchen full of smoke, ran outdoors placed it in the grill and it went out.  Tried to light it with a cigarette lighter, no luck. Went back and read the instructions and found a propane torch quickly got it up and smoking, just like they suggested.Back inside, I seasoned the sirloin with some Montreal seasoning from Samsclub.  Poked the steak with a fork a few hundred times both sides to tenderize.  Seasoned the haddock with Tuscan garlic seasoning from Samsclub.  Ran outdoors placed all meats on the upper racks for smoking for about and 1 1/2 hrs.  Remember, I am a guy, nothing fancy.  Cooked up some instant turkey stuffing, hungry Jack mashed potatoes and a 15 year old bag of frozen peas.  Cooked the 1"" thick steak about 7-8 minutes each side on the lower rack.  It came out med rare and with perfect grill  scorching on the surface.Some of the  best tasting food we had had in years.  The Haddock should have been cooked less time, but aside from that, the taste was excellent.

  I can't believe people are using propane torches to light these smoke tubes.There's an old saying ""you only need to be 10% smarter than the equipment you're working with"" and to me wasting time standing over a pellet tube with a propane torch in hand trying to light them is simply a ridiculous waste of time not to mention expensive.Like I said you only need to be 10% smarter than equipment you're working with, that's why I use a shot glass and 91% alcohol to light my pellets.  it's far cheaper and much safer.  Once again you only need to be 10% smarter than the equipment you're working with so please ( don't light  the pellets on fire in the shot glass)91% alcohol burns very hot and very clean which means unlike lighter fluid it leaves absolutely no residue and imparts absolutely no flavor.I simply take an old shot glass, fill it with pellets then pour just enough 91% alcohol to cover the pellets. I let them soak for about 5 minutes while I prep the BBQ. Unlike water alcohol will not cause the pellets to swell.When I'm ready to light the tube  I simply pour off the excess alcohol, drop the alcohol soaked pellets on top of the pellets in the Smoke tube and light them. in less than a few minutes your smoke tube will be billowing clouds of smoke.Be forewarned don't Let the pellets in the Smoke tube flame too long  as you will ignite too many pellets and it will generate billowing clouds of very dense smoke and burn your pellets up much faster.Although I will say that being able to generate dense clouds of smoke comes in handy sometimes, for example if I want to cold smoke a steak before grilling it,When cold smoking a steak I'll let half the tube catch on fire blow it out and put it in the smoker. Then I Fire the pellet grill up for just one cycle, when it hits a hundred and fifty degrees I unplug it so it doesn't go through the fan cool down period, this allows the pellet in the burner to slowly burned down. If the temperature in the smoker drops below 90 degrees I'll plug it in for another cycle,I let the steaks smoke over Mesquite until the internal temperature of the steak reaches 100 degrees at which point I pull it and post sear it on a Weber with lump charcoal to the final temperature. If you like extremely strong smoke you can let the steak cold smoke until it reaches 120 internal. Pull it off the barbecue and let it rest until it drops back to 100 internal and then post sear it.If I'm using the tube for say ribs or pulled pork then I only let a small fraction of the pellets catch fire before blowing them out. Using this method the tube will run for about 5 hours.By the way It takes less than a half an ounce of 91% alcohol to light the smoke tube meaning that a $2.50 quart bottle of 91% alcohol is enough to light your smoke tube 64 times making it far less expensive than using those ridiculously expensive disposable propane cylinders.The bottom line is this is an excellent product for any BBQ. I find it almost indispensable in my electric cooker for smoking fish.If you're interested I'll give you a little background in my barbecue endeavors along with some tips that I picked up over the years.My wife and I have been involved in competitive BBQ. Since the 1970s prior to an injury that disabled me, my lovely wife and I traveled the country in motorhomes towing whatever BBQ we could afford to Bbq competitions. As time went on and we started winning more and more Awards picking up sponsors along the way we were able to upgrade to a custom-built 40 foot Class A Diesel Pusher towing a custom-built Klaus BBQ pit.Over the years we've developed several award-winning recipes and even though we are now retired from the barbecue circuit we still like to barbecue, but on a much smaller scale.After 50 Years of cooking on large stick burners I never thought I would ever even consider a pellet smoker.I've cooked on everything from a klaus custom built BBQ Pit, off the shelf Gator BBQ Pits... Green eggs, Weber Smokey Mountains and Ugly Drum smokers, heck one of my favorite BBQs was an old dryer drum..... and now  I can add pellet grills to that list and I have to say I think at this point next to a stick burner they are my favorite.We have 2 horse ranches one in California and one in Montana and unfortunately that means we simply don't have the time anymore to sit around babysitting a stick burner for 12 to 14 hours. But we still love our barbecue so we decided to give pellet grills a shot, at first I wasn't overly impressed with them. they take quite a bit of adjustment to technique to make them work right. But with the proper technique they can produce BBQ that's  just as good as the best competition stick burner.With that said this is probably one of the best accessories I have found for your pellet grill. It is easy to use and allows you much more precise control over how much smoke is being generated by your barbecue.One of the biggest newbie mistakes to barbecue we see is food coming out of the barbecue tasting like it was left in a smoldering forest fire. I hate over smoked food, smoke is like any other seasoning it should accent the flavor of the food not be the flavor of the food.That's where this tube really shines it allows you to very precisely control the amount of smoke being generated in your barbecue. It also allows you to cook using generic cooking pellets while saving your good flavor pellets for the smoke tube..Generic competition blend pellets produce a very mild smoke, you can add Mesquite to your pellet tube to bump it up a notch or if you really want strong Mesquite flavor fill the hopper with Mesquite and a tube with Mesquite but you need to be careful again not to over smoke the food.It also allows you to mix and match wood flavors, for example Apple in the hopper and Cherry in the Smoke tube.I find the pellet tube works best with Alderwood and an electric smoker for smoking fish.I find that stick burners, pellet grills, charcoal grills all have a tendency of massively over smoking fish. So I have a small electric smoker that's dedicated to doing nothing but fish and I must say This smoke tube works amazingly well in the electric smoker for fish..The bottom line is you're probably going to want to buy two of these.

  Nice Product.  A full tube lasts me about 4.5-5 hours with quality pellets, less with cheaper Walmart variety.  Adds a good level of additional smoke.  I fill it with pellets and let it overhang about 5 inches off the prep shelf on the side of my grill.  Hit it with the propane torch for 15 seconds or so until a flame appears.  Let the flame burn out or blow out after a couple of minutes.  Then put the tube in the grill.  The end on the self doesnt get hot so it is easy to pick up.I have recommended to friends and would buy again.

  I have a pellet smoker and it's easy to use but it's lackinf in flavor compared to how I used to do it using charcoal and wood so I've been searching for a solution to keep the ease of use I get with the pellet smoker but to get more flavor in my smokes. It's like I've been riding the train to flavor town but it keeps breaking down. This smoke tube was recommended to me and I put it to use on a brisket the day I got it.It takes a bit of checking to make sure you get the pellets lit well enough to stay smouldering . What you need to know is that some pellets will spill out after you lay it on its side so you need to have enough pellets lit to get past that spill out point. Or fill it 85% full so they don't spill out. Once it's going it burns easily in my smoker. I got just over 5.5 hours of smoke out of it. It added a lot more smoke flavor to my brisket. I finally got to flavor town. It's still not like using solid wood or charcoal but a lot more smoke flavor is added with this little contraption.

  I'm new to the hobby, so take my comments with a grain of salt.These things are at a great price and they're fairly sturdy constrution, but I managed to lose a screw on one of mine, and the other actually had a screw snap off.  I recommend checking with a torx bit (T7 IIRC) to see if any of your screws are loose, and if they are, remove the loose screws, put some loctite on them, screw them back in, and then let them cure over night.If you should happen to discover you've lost a screw, they use the same size screws as the old CD ROM mounting screws from days of old.Minor point to note, but the T latch is on the side of the safe handle, whereas most tutorials I've seen have them on the side of the bite handle.  Also, you might just want to remove the T latch, on one of mine it swings freely and gets in the way, whereas on the other it stays in place.  Also, don't try squeezing to release the T latch, it wont work and that's how one of my screws snapped off.I was happy enough with the purchase to order a second set.  On both sets the black knife is much stiffer (as others have noted).  I put some oil on all of them (Sentry Tuf Glide Dry Film Rust Inhibitor -- was available for next day on Amazon,) and the second black knife really loosened up, whereas I suspect I just need to work on breaking in the first.

  First off, we got only one product in the first batch, but a quick email later and the company made good on it and re-sent both of them. Kudos to customer service. My son reports that they loosen up quickly and that the black one is slightly snugger that the silver one, I suppose because of the powder coating. He's enjoying them thoroughly. I'd probably get them again when he wears them out.

  When I received this mat, it had a very strong odor so I posted here asking for feedback and the company posted a respond on how to clean the mat to eliminate the odor within an hour of my posting.  I responded to them, before I use vinegar on the mat I wanted to ensure if in fact the odor doesn't clear from what they offered that I could still return it or would it void my return.  NO response.  I've now posted that question three times in a few days (amazon won't post a question without a response) and the company won't respond.  I am left to assume that while they encourage you to clean it with vinegar once you do, it voids a return so you are left with a smelly mat.  I'm returning it before I try cleaning it based on the other reviews here that the smell doesn't in fact go away.

  Been looking at rangefinders for about a month trying to decide if getting one would really be an asset to my golf game. Considered getting a $200 one but that seemed like an unreasonable risk if I ended up not liking it or finding out it doesn't help my game. Found this one and decided I could do $90 and not feel bad if it was something I didn't end up liking/using. It's had great reviews so far so i went for it.Really wasn't expecting much out of a $90 golf-rangefinder, but I've been pleasantly surprised with this product! For the price and function, you cannot beat it. Slope function works great, target accuracy is spot on, and the fact that it runs on AAA's is just a bonus (CR2's are pricey for a battery, but AAAs are cheap as dirt). Magnification is more than sufficient and very clear (adjust clarity by turning eyepiece); unless you've got it set up on a tripod, getting a good read on something beyond 150 is always going to be a little tricky, doesn't matter what rangefinder/brand you're using. My only unknown right now is the durability of it, but it does have a 12-month warranty on it so really no matter how you look at it this is totally worth a shot. (UPDATE: had it for a year, no issues. Still haven’t upgraded becuz this things has been GREAT!)My suggestion if you're thinking about getting a rangefinder to help with golf: Get this one. For $90 its a chance to see if it really helps your game, and it functions well enough to really help you make a decision. This has really helped my game more than I expected and I didn't have to break the bank to do it. I'll still probably upgrade to a nicer brand (most likely PrecisionPro since they do lifetime battery supply) but now I've got at least a year to save the money while I use this one. Even then, I'll probably just give this one to my son or keep as an extra to give to someone I'm golfing with for them to use.GREAT product! Totally worth trying it out. $90 for a golf rangefinder that works THIS well: you can't go wrong!

  I am an avid golfer.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now (roughly 5 times) and am very satisfied with it's performance.  I also use a hip GPS and compare it to that and it is very close to spot on.The manual is easy enough to follow, and the buttons are easy to use.  I'm attaching two images taken from my phone (so ignore any black boarders, these do not appear in use).  The pin seek feature is fantastic.  I believe for tournaments you need to have the slope feature turned off though, and I'm not sure if that feature exists.  If it does, I will update this review.  Otherwise, you can just use Mode 1 (M1) and scan for a target.Overall I am very pleased with this.  It has gone above my expectations. A few of these reviews seem a little fishy (who points this at a building?), so I wanted to provide a real review.  For golf use, 100% would purchase it again or as a gift for someone.  Construction is solid and the vibration feature is great.  I can use it easy enough with sunglasses, and the focus is easy to adjust with the rotating ring around the viewport.I do not know if it has a low battery alert on the display, but maybe in the next revision they could add it.  I also wish it would immediately take a distance with just one button push, but I believe the first press is to ""wake it up"", so no real worries here.

  I will say the product is better than expected with a few things that can be improved. First of all, I was surprised to find a range finder with a slope calculation feature at this price. I compared the accuracy with Bushnell range finder I have for distances less than 100 yards. They are almost identical within 100 yards. I haven't tested for more than 100 yards yet. I'll do so in coming weekend.There are two things I didn't like about this product.1. If you adjust focus, it affects the clarity of display(yardage numbers, slope and so on displayed inside the scope). I thought this was strange. Other range finders I tried didn't do that. Also, the display would be better if it's little more vivid.2. You have to press down quite firmly on buttons. Maybe I'm used to Bushnell on which you don't have press down hard.Overall, I will say I'm happy with this product so far(more testings will be coming soon). It doesn't feel cheap at all.As long as distances more than 100 yards are accurate enough when it's tested, I'll boost my rating to 5 star.Edited:I purchased another one(newer model). It's better than the previous model. The accuracy is as good as Bushnell. Pin-seeker technology is better with the jolt function. It vibrates when it detects the pin. I'm boosting it to 5 star.

  This rangefinder is AMAZING and that is not an overstatement. I would say i am an intermediate golfer and it has been an awesome tool to have. I take it out to the range to pin point my iron distances and in the course it made my choice of clubs way easier than just guessing the yardage. It comes with a nice hard case and a strap. The rangefinder itself is sturdy and doesnt look cheap. I paid less than $90 and i think its worth every penny. Equipped with all the modes a golfer would ever need. Its shocking to see that other $200 rangefinders doesnt even have the features this one has (like the slope). In terms of accuracy, i tested it on the range and on the course, comparing it to GPS and the yardage markers, and the results were shocking, it was better than i thought. Within 100 yards it was dead set accurate. Outside 100 yards was also pretty accurate, sometimes dead set or off by a yard or two. Overall, great product and i would recommend this to all types of golfers!

  As a new boat owner, I am proud of the boat and not so much of my docking skills.  The scuff eraser helped me to reconcile these. My first docking maneuvers left unsightly scuffs from plastic dock bumpers on the nearly flawless gel coat of the boat.  The scuff eraser powered by passion to restore my pride in the boat and hide deficiencies in my docking skills made the trick. It took not more than 15 minutes to remove most of the unsightly scuffs ( a few more than covered in the photos). I consider this close to magic. Unfortunately, the eraser suffered a lot from performing this trick and retired to the waste bin. Overall, it's a good product to restore your pride and boost confidence, but it's short of magic as you likely will need a new eraser to keep the magic going.

  I normally don’t write reviews but I had to for these. I was so amazed. I literally wiped the eraser across my boat seat and it was instantly clean. It took away those dark dirt spots that look like lines in a second. I was so amazed I couldn’t stop cleaning. Ha ha. I will be telling people when they borrow my boat to donate some of these:) I highly recommend these to anyone.

  These erasers are so much more durable and better made than the ones you buy at the grocery store.  They last longer and don't break down and crumble once you used them for 20 seconds.

  I've tried a normal car brush, a deck brush, and a scrub brush on my boat. They get it clean, but don't remove all the scuffs and stains.This got my boat 99% clean without killing myself. It worked so well that I tried them on my work truck. I normally use simple green and a scrub brush. After doing that, I was able to get off even more with this sponge.

  After a long tuna fishing trip we had to deep clean the boat. There was one area on the fiberglass that I hit with soap and water and a stiff brush maybe 3 times. I finally walked away. Went back down to the boat 2 days later and tried again. Forgot that I had purchased these. Then sitting there in my dock box were these magic erasers. Added a little bit of water and rubbed a few times and the mark was gone. Then I proceeded to go around the entire cockpit and hit little areas that I otherwise would have accepted as clean. So far after first use I would say these are a must. They are firmer than others I've tried and didn't seem to wear prematurely. Time will tell but these are no longer in the dock box they made it on the boat full time. Boston whaler 315 conquest.

  I was dubious, but they actually do work. We keep the boat waxed but there are always those scuff marks from a hose, fishing rod or gaff rubbing on a fiberglass corner, etc. Seems to take most off with mild rubbing. Does not scratch or remove wax.Basically a 'Magic Eraser' like used in the house (by 'Mr. Clean?)  made for boats.

  Having owned and used binoculars most of my life, both from the decks of small pleasure boats and the pilothouses of large commercial ships, I can tell you these represent a tremendous value.  With 10X magnification, they would not be ideal as your only set of binoculars on a boat, where sea motion makes anything stronger than about 7X impractical to hold steadily.  But on land, at a sporting event or concert, you can really get a closeup with these--clear and crisp.  They're incredibly compact, easy to use and for the price...?  I may get a couple more pair, for the picnic basket, the glove box of my car, whatever.  Unless you're equipping for a night time military operation or something, just get a pair of these!

  I use these mainly for hiking. The binoculars are fairly compact light weight and have a nice feel to them --- They were just the right size and weight to carry on my hip for multiple miles. The included neck starp is okay , but I wish it was a little longer. Clarity is better than expected for a pair of binoculars in this price range. They also work fairy well in low light conditions. I am able to see in the woods with them until it's too dark for me to go. They're also small enough to take to baseball games, graduation, etc. With standing out in the crowd. I'd highly recommend these binoculars across hiking and sports events. If u are tired of thr really cheap compact binoculars that don't stay aligned or have poor image quality, try a pair of these compact binoculars.

  I have 10x42 Nikon Action binoculars for bird watching and carrying it always in my car. however, for sometimes while roaming around the streets of euro, it is not that easy to take with you for watching migrating birds hence 10x25 is extremely suitable for your bag since it is small but works really well.If you need a second one for your daily usage, this is the one with its low price. Another opportunity to use this binocular is to get your child's attraction for bird watching, it is small enough for small kids if they are interested in your bird watching activities.

  My young son is a budding ""nature tracker/science kid"" and spends so much time exploring the world around him. He was putting so much good use into his children's ""play"" binoculars that I decided to invest in a ""real"" set for him. Finding a pair that were light enough and small enough to fit in his hands was a challenge but I found it in these compact binoculars. I love how they fold even smaller when not in use but spread enough that he and I can both use them, plus they work great!

  I bought these binoculars in order to have a light weight, compact option when I dont want to carry my heavier binoculars, that I also purchased this one. This is a decent option at an attractive price. They are not as bright as my more expensive (x5) set, but are adequate. Light weight, compact size and easy to adjust diopter make this an attractive value, that added very little weight to my carry on bag for airline travel.

  Wife likes compact binoculars she can grab quickly and use without much thought.  These are a little larger than others of this design I have owned, but not by much.  The optic appear to be right on and well aligned.  Field of view is decent, though maybe a bit narrow.  The housing is easy to grip and durable.  These are working well, in that we let them set around, handy, then when we need them, grab them and look.  Focus is quick and the eye relief feels just about right.

  We picked these compact binoculars for a trip to Southern California. Read the product page before buying and these do not disappoint. They may not have as wide of view as some of the bigger options but to keep in a pack and lightweight these are perfect.

  I am really enjoying these little binoculars. They are great for everything from bird and deer watching in my backyard and the woods near my house to concerts and sporting events. I also own a pair of larger Nikon Prostaff 7S 10X42s that are awesome as well but these you hardly know are around your neck. Their small size and being able to take them easily and have them with me while hiking or doing outside activities was my reason for purchase. They come with a handy neck strap and travel case too. The optics are good, you can see perfectly and they focus great with adequate light but not quite there with my larger set. They are fine for the vast majority of what you would use binoculars for though. It's important to understand that not only these but any set of binoculars this size will not let in enough light for you to see well in lower light conditions.

  At 6'3 225 these Large shorts fit horribly. The butt is too tight. The crotch is too small leaving a bulge. The compression shorts are looser than the actual shorts. I like small/shorts but these are not proportional and cut from a horrible pattern.

  Quality is what you would expect for $20, so pretty happy there. But sizing is weird. Follow their sizing guide, but also consider one size up even from there. The shorts themselves are tight fit, but the compression shorts are not unless you have pretty large legs. If you follow their sizing guide your bulge will show.  Also the material is double layer mesh which I did not expect from the images. Looked like pretty lightweight shorts in images but its more medium weight.So basically not exactly what I expected but still pretty decent shorts if your legs fit the weird sizing.

  The outside layer of the shorts is cut very tight and short, I'm 5' 8"" ~190 lbs. and wear size L shorts from any major brand comfortably so I sized up to XL for these and they are tight all around my thighs and sit and inch or two above my knee when standing which I don't mind too much for running.  The inside ""compression"" lining is very disappointing, it is cut very loose and the material is so thin and weak that it offers very little athletic support.  Also, I have an Iphone 11 with a relatively thin case and when I put it in the pocket on the thigh it sags down and slides all over when you are running, so much so that I took it out and held it in my hand because that was more comfortable.  I was hoping for an alternative to an arm band for my phone when running and these did not provide that.

  I love this style of shorts. The inner material is absolutely great for hiking and working out. Keeps the chafing away. I actually bought a second pair a little larger because I liked this style.However, the outer shorts are a little tight. The inner feel great, they are right and fit well, but the outter short layer could be a little more loose.I still love them. I bought the larger size to try and fit better, I’m thinking of a third pair and going even larger.

  Liner is far too loose for the fit of the shorts, the shorts were an appropriate fit for a US 34/L, but the liner was comparable to an XXL underwear, maybe a size 38, which doesn't make sense for this. I thoroughly read the reviews to get the right size, and it's not an issue of fit, the liner just needs to be much smaller compared to the shorts themselves.

  But after minimal use (two or three runs), there were numerous threads coming loose creating a pull in the shorts. At least 4 and the pocket had large excess thread, around 3' that pulled loose without an aggravation from me, I just felt something tickling my leg.Fits nice, looks nice. But not well made.

  I testes this water filter to see if it was working. I used the test stick that came with my ZERO water pitcher. So, I tested the water from the TAP. 269 PPM than I tested the water through the refrigerator water filter PPM was only 243 only a change of 10 PPM (PARTICLES PER MILLION). So, I ran 2 gallons of water through the water system in the refrigerator thinking maybe it needs a break in period. Mind you the family has been using the new filter through the refrigerator for about a week now.  Still only 243 PPM. Thank I took the same water from the refrigerator and ran it through the ZERO water filter, and you know what the test stick came back with 000 PPM.So, this filter is a total scam. I don’t think most will go fare to test to see if the filter is working like I did. But for $45 I needed to make sure it works. But it failed miserably. I would have been happy if it came back with 150 PPM, but only a 23-point change heck no. I sent it back. TO bad Zero water doesn't make a refrigerator water filter..

  Do not buy from this source.  These are defective filters. I replaced the old filter with the one I received from Amazon ( having done this many times before) and the new filter made a grinding motor sound and barely dripped water.  I re-installed several times with the same result.  I subsequently went to Home Depot and bought the same filter which installed and worked perfectly on the first try. They are selling defects.  Do not buy from this source.

  Original September purchase: product came in original manuf packaging, fits well and works fine.12 March Update #2: went for more water and got the hammering sound.  Upon opening the filter cartridge area, the paper towel I used to pad the cartridge is now soaked.  Redid papertowel (little thicker) and when I went back to check on it a couple hours later, paper towel getting wet again.  Just submitted a refund request.  Will try to buy from a brick/mortar store to see if I have better luck or even try to find an alternate option.  Will see what works!12 March Update: bought again but had issues when I installed it.  I’d get a hammering noise and then no water would flow.  Searched high and low for the ‘how to fix’ and found it on a YouTube video.  The latest cartridge I received was ever so slightly smaller than the last one, so it was making a complete seal when the filter compartment lid was closed.  So upon advice from the YouTube video I put in a folded piece of paper towel (about 1/4 sheet folded up) btwn cartridge and door and Voila - it worked w/out issued!  No hammering noise and water flows freely.  Will update again if this changes anytime soon!

  Everydrop filter 1 is a fair product, but I think it is quite expensive as a refrigerator filter. I have a big household, a family of five with two dogs, our daily water need is quite high. The water flow with filter 1 is time-consuming to fill a cup of water, especially when everybody gets home around the same time and all want some ice water. Therefore, I recommend any household over four to purchase a water filter system rather than rely on the filtered water through the refrigerator. We recently switched to an under sink Waterdrop reverse osmosis water filtration system. Though it is pricy to purchase in the first place, the system definitely satisfied our water need and the replacement filters are also affordable considering the filter life and replace frequency. The system is also quite stylish and only takes very little space. I use the filtered water to make coffee and fresh OJs for my family in the morning and they all love it. I think the major reason is that the system reduces a great percentage of TDS in the original water, which the water after filtration is not that “hard.”I used to find those ugly white scale deposits pile up on my kettle, but I do not have to deal with it anymore with the help of this RO system.

  I was skeptical about buying the water filter after all the negative reviews, but it surprised me. My fridge was new and this is the first time I had to change the filter. Whatever filter was already IN the fridge had a terrible plastic taste so I was concerned that it would stay around with the new filter. To my big surprise it was much better. I only drink spring water and have drank from the filter and liked it- it had no after taste or plastic taste anymore. I did have some air bubbles following the filter change but it does go away after a little while. I made sure to run the water before the first use (as directed) although I didn't measure the water so was it exactly however many gallons??? No idea! I am very happy with my purchase and will only order this filter for my Whirpool fridge.

  This item works. I purchased a different product that was half the price that did not work. This is the only filter thst works on my whirlpool side by side fridge/freezer. And, these filters only last me about 2 to 3 months. Getting expensive to use. Maybe it's my water pipes,I don't know,I'm on city water in florida. But it plugs up about every 3 months,and I need replace. Update: I discovered that the filter does not insert into the holder tight enough, to solve, put a small piece cardboard,or folded paper towel between end of filter and door that closes onto it. Forcing the filter tight into position.  That is what causes many issues people are having with their filter,hammering, low output, noise, leaking etc. It needs be pushed tight into housing. Test by just pushing in on it while dispensing water. Trust me, it's the issue.

  Better flow than the ones that came with the fridge and subjectively the water seems to taste better. I've read this one filters out fluoride better than the old factory ones did, though I haven't tested that. Stupid expensive for a filter though. They've got us cornered with the custom filter type.

  Every now and then I can't get it to attach to something right but in their defense it's usually because I don't give it enough time to adhere to the surface. If you're having trouble with it sticking make sure you give it a good amount of time before you actually connect the stripes and put a load on the stripes. If they don't have time to settle it'll just fall off the wall.

   This review is for the “65.6ft Led Strip Lights, Tenmiro Ultra-Long RGB LED Lights Strip 5050 LED Tape Lights Flexible Color Changing LED Lights with 44 Keys IR Remote for Bedroom, Kitchen, DIY Home Decoration(4X16.4ft)” sold by NIGHTSPARKLEIncluded in the box is a remote, a power-brick style power supply (12v DC 5A), 4 spools of LED Strip lights, the IR based controller, an IR remote (with 4 legs to connect the 4 strips to), connecting hardware, and a small brochure.The lights on the strip can be set on a good array of colors.  When selecting a color or pattern, the same color and pattern goes across all 4 strips.  These LEDs are NOT individually addressable.  If you want to have that functionality, like light chasing patterns, or each LED to be of a different color than its neighbors, then you need to look at a different style of LED Strip (look for DREAMCOLOR or “Chasing LED’s” in the descriptions).The lights are NOT WEATHER PROOF or WATERPROOF.  These lights were designed to be in an indoor configuration as the diodes for the LED are simply surface mounted and exposed to the environment with no protection on a carrier strip.  So behind a TV, under inside cabinets and molding, and accent lights for a room or under a bed would be a great place to put these.The adhesive on the strip looks to be “just barely strong enough” to hold it in place. So if you intend to have it mounted for a longer time, I would suggest looking into adding or replacing the adhesive that comes with the strips or using some mounting hardware or dedicated LED strip mounting channels. If you want to beef up the adhesive, 3M makes great adhesive tapes for this need.The strip itself is basically a flexible circuit board where the diodes and other surface mount components are affixed.  The LEDs are 50x50mm and each LED carrier contains separate diodes for Red, Green, or Blue in the physical package.  While this configuration does give great color for the 3 primary colors, giving combinations of colors (like an orange, or a yellow, or a white) is not as pure as what you might be expecting, but all in all still pretty good. The strips have cut areas about every 6.5” so you can trim the length of the strip to match most desired lengths.  Each section has 3 LED packages on it, giving an equivalent of 3 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Blue LED’s per strip.  There is no additional “white” LED (cold or warm) on this strip.If you do choose to cut and splice, make sure you get the 4 conductor connectors for LED strips. It is possible to buy extra connecting hardware to splice back in cut lengths together — however, I would suggest keeping the total length of one powered run as what was provided by the factory — unless you can engineer in more +12V power supplies.  From what I have seen as “standard issue”, a 12V 1.25A supply should power 1 leg of 5M (16.5’) of LEDs.The Remote is Infra-Red — you have to point the remote at the IR LED that comes off the controller.  If you don’t have a clear line of sight between the remote and the controller, you won’t be able to control the lights.  If you want to have it so that you can control it via Radio signals, look for a replacement controller that does support RF operations.This controller is NOT MUSIC / SOUND sensitive.The Power supply is sufficient to power the four included rolls of LED Strip lighting with no apparent issues. The power supply cord from the wall to the power brick is a little on the short side ( about 18” ) and the length from the power brick to the barrel connector was about 3 feet — and is as usually expected for a generally sourced 12v 5A power adapter. It is 2 pronged which is typical for the US power grid, and this version did not have interchangeable power connectors in case you wanted to install these in UK, FR, etc.So, again, these strips function as specified, so no issues there.  Just make sure that these give you the ability to get you the quality of light you need and only use these indoors in an average humidity environment.

  As part of her room redecoration, my daughter wanted to add strip lights around the entire ceiling. I was happy to find set that was actually long enough for the entire ceiling without having to find strips to add to it. We looked at several different sets for not only the features of the lights, but the remote control as well. My daughter wanted this remote because of the way she could get the colors adjusted, the ability to dim them, and the ability to change the sequence, all very easily from one remote without having to use her phone. She put them up herself without any assistance from me and she's only 12 years old. None of the strip has fallen or puckered. The set is actually 4 strips with connectors. The connectors blend in and are virtually unseen.

   Got these lights to spruce up my room. Very easy to install and operate. They are even foldable so you don’t have to worry about going in 90 angles with these lighting strips. I do wish there was a better way to connect the four light strips that came in the box. Better yet I wish it had all been one roll. Either way, amazing lights!

  I was a little bit nervous to put these up, as I was never really sure how they worked, but the strips were fairly easy to set up. The instructions were somewhat unclear as to the connection of a series of strips. For those as bamboozled as myself: cut the end off the first strip, cut the beginning off of the second strip, and use the included plastic snap connectors to create a continuous strip of light. Make sure the strips are in the correct orientation with the contacts matching on both sides. You can bend the metal arms on the inside of the plastic connector if you have difficulty getting the ends of the strips inserted.Otherwise, these are more or less your typical basic LED strips. They provide excellent mood lighting but aren't sufficiently luminous for visually intensive tasks. These particular strips are somewhat lacking in features, with four non-customizable color changing modes and no Bluetooth support. The remote and receiver have enough range for any standard sized bedroom, but the control box must be within line of sight due to the use of infrared. This small issue is exacerbated by the unnecessarily short power lead. The cord is barely able to reach my outlet from 10ft ceilings.One last thing worth mentioning is that these go further than I would have expected. I only needed about two and a half of the four strips included to line the perimeter of my ceiling. Ultimately, I think that these are plenty functional for the price, bearing in mind the caveats previously mentioned.

  They work well AFTER you get an o-ring to seal them.  After seeing the issue others have, water leaking AROUND the filter instead of going through it, and making very certain it was correctly seated, I put a thin rubber o-ring around the filter (most hardware stores carry these) which is reusable (I've had one o-ring for 7 filters so far).  The o-ring makes seating it firmer as I push the filter in, and SEALS the filter so water must go through it.  Get a thin one, it must fit between the filter and the wall of the insert area.  I put the ring about 3/4"" from the top of the filter, then push it in, and I can feel the o-ring ""rolling"" up the filter as I push and it seats the filter in very firm and tight.  **See pics.  This about a 2"" o-ring, and they are cheap.  Brita should use this idea and send a small o-ring with each 3 pack or pitcher. I think people who are complaining about the water quality don't realize the water is leaking around the filter and not being filtered.  After the O-Ring, it takes MUCH longer for the water to go through the filter, so I know it's working.

  Waste of money.  I bought these refills in addition to the pitcher.  I was sick for a month, couldn't figure out why, then I read more reviews on line.  100's of folks had the same horrible gastric symptoms, headaches, and didn't know why until this commonality was discovered in a group.  I cannot say for sure, but when 100's of people are having the same complaints while using, then the symptoms cvompletely go away after stopping... you be the judge.

  Here I am writing a separate review for these filters. Total waste of time and money. Kept the pitcher in my fridge and away from light as much as I can, only when pouring water and I got Algae / mold. I researched and read that here that people were having the same problem. I contacted Brita / Clorox for help, and all I got was the same ""copy and paste"" answer. So disappointing. We're people here Brita, please show some compassion for us consumers using our hard earned money buying your product to improve our lives a little bit.

  If you have a Brita jug, you'll probably need a pack of these.  I live in San Jose, and the water here is ridiculous.  It comes out orange sometimes, and it smells like rotten eggs.  We did a water test and we even called an inspector to test it as well, both said the water meets the standard (whatever that means).The filters help a lot.  The water comes through clear, tastes fine, smells fine.  After about a month, there's a definite layer of a powdery orange something on the bottom of our dispenser and so I clean it and switch out the filter.  The package says to switch the filter out every two months.  No, we don't go through an exceptional amount of water (it's just my husband and myself, and I drink less than a glass of water a day ... no joke, yes I know it's not healthy).  We tested a sample of the sediment water as well, the test found nothing harmful and we're not dead yet so I guess we'll just keep drinking it, whatever it is.

  Very easy to install/insert. Filtering process is not fast, as it is filtering your water from contaminants. It is NOT going to be fast, as some of the 1 and 2 star users have complained. It is doing it's job - making clear, clean, tasty water by filtering, but it does not take long (less than 4 minutes to fill a pitcherful).Have purchased this 3 pack four times (each filter lasts around 90 days). Very inexpensive for the job that they perform - and these are the OEM Brita filters, so the fit and finish is perfect. Going to buy another 3 pack as soon as I finish this review (had to comment on the 1 and 2 star users that just don't get it).

  First, I'm really glad about purchasing the Brita water pitcher. It just makes me feel so much safer knowing that my drinking water is somewhat filtered and not directly from the super old pipes that my building is made of. These replacement filters are very easy to install. Hint: Rinse them with water for about 10 seconds before installation and then they slide right in. Also make sure the filter sits at the very bottom.Finally, another pointer I wanted to put out there is that the light on top of the Brita which indicates the quality of the filter is not super accurate and based on average results. So if you're not using it that much (or using it too much) you might want to adjust the replacement periods accordingly.

  Bought a new Brita for someone in our household who's convinced tap water is officially the worst thing ever, even if where I live is *renowned* for its tap water ---- so, needless to say, I wanted to make sure I wasn't spending crazy amounts on the filters when I was happy with my tap water to begin with.I hadn't comparison shopped them before, beyond what was available on Amazon, but felt like the 3 pack was a decent price online... so went for it.Let's just say I went to the supermarket  recently and saw how much a pack of three replacement filters were there.... and got total sticker shock!Needless to say, I'll continue to buy my replacement filters on Amazon.(As for the quality of the filters: they're official Brita, and Brita really does make a difference -- especially if you don't live in a location with tap water as good as mine. But if you have good tap water, then I really don't think it's necessary -- but your mileage will vary!)

  I bought the 3-pack filters elsewhere. However, I found that the new filter style leaked some water down the side of the filter after the install, instead of going through the inside element. After looking at it, I pushed down harder on the replacement filter to seat it correctly. The upper lip of the replacement filter is now just below the lower lip of the housing. That fixed the problem. Now all water exits through the four holes in the filter bottom. The older filters did not require as much elbow grease. Hope this helps those complaining about leaking filters or tap-tasting filtered water. We've enjoyed our Brita for years and I hope it continues to last.

  UPDATE: It's been 7 months since I got this and I'm still thrilled with it. It's gotten a bit faded from the sun beating down on it and I ended up using a staple gun to attach it more securely to the house, but it's still working great. One of the magnets fell out of the bottom, but I can easily sew it back in (non-sewers could probably use super glue).It has taken so much abuse, between the hot midwest sun to the sub-freezing temps and three German Shepherds racing through it multiple times a day. I still highly recommend this for anyone wanting to keep bugs out of their house. It's such a practical alternative to a sliding screen door. I'd like to always have a screen door like this.I will probably replace it with a new one next spring, but I'm so pleased with the quality and ease of use. It's definitely worth it!___________________________I got this because the dogs love spending time outside, but now that it’s warming up, bugs will start trying to get inside. I just got this today, but so far, it’s done exactly what I want - lets the dogs freely go in & out & keeps sealed so bugs can’t get in.It was very simple to install. I just used the tacks & stuck them in a few key places. I started by holding it up to get it aligned & placed the top center tack. It’s a little tough getting the tacks through the edge because it’s reinforced really well, so if you’re doing this method. It’s probably easiest to push the tacks through first. I did the top sides next, then worked down the side to the bottom making sure the center could still close. I got a couple in the bottom sides & it was solid. I was able to push the tacks in a bit, but used a hammer to finish the job. They’re pretty sturdy tacks.We’ve got 3 German Shepherds and they were able to get in & our pretty easily & the screen closed pretty nicely behind them. I walked in & out several times carrying things and it didn’t get tugged too much & sealed after I’d walked through. We may even try replacing our sliding screen with this so we can open & close it.This was exactly what I wanted, it’s working wonderfully so far and I couldn’t be more pleased with it!

  I discovered this product at a friend’s house who has been using this screen for years. My dogs always walk through my screen door and continuously put holes in it, which results in unwanted bugs and birds finding their way in. I bought this as a solution.This was easy to install, it took me less than five minutes. It’s only been a few weeks but I have been very pleased with this product. When my dogs go into my screened in porch, the screen immediately closes after them. My porch will be a more enjoyable place this summer with this screen.

  This hanging screen door is amazing. We wanted to keep flies out, but allow the dog to go in and out so we don't have to get up and open the door for him each time. So it functions as screen and doggie door. Plus it is easy to go through if you are carrying a tray in your hands. It just gently sweeps aside and clicks back into place because of the magnets.We put it up in 10 minutes on our wood door frame using the provided tacks. There is also Velcro in the package in case you have a metal or plastic door frame. We liked it so much we bought another for our sunroom. It may flap open if it is very windy. GREAT PRODUCT!!

  This is awesome! I have a 5 month old puppy and have been potty training her, which involves constantly opening and closing the screen door to let her out. With this magnetic screen she can let herself out and it’s been wonderful. It was a breeze to install too - went up in about 15 minutes. I have a metal door frame so I used the Velcro strips and it was super easy. Great product and perfect for dogs!

  I had a As-Seen-On-Tv version of one of these screens a few years ago that was terrible, so I was nervous about purchasing this one, and debated about it for a few weeks. Wish I had ordered it right away. It's nothing like the crappy version I bought the first time. Screen is way stronger and the magnets are awesome. They are strong and go all the way down the entire middle from top to bottom. We are supposed to be getting a new storm door with a full screen put in in a few weeks and I almost don't even want it now because my dogs love being able to just push their way in and out of this screen door whenever they want, and I love not having to get up and down to let out 4 dogs everytime they want to do some sunbathing (all at different times of course). Only took a day for all 4 dogs (2 of which are only 6 mths and 2 that are 5 yrs) to figure out how to push in and out of this screen. It's easy for them to push through, yet strong enough to stay closed, and close up right after they go through it. My husband was even more skeptical than I was (mumbled something about ""wasting money"" when he first saw it) and he even admitted that this was a really great purchase that exceeded expectations. The only thing I can maybe say in the negative is the bottom tacks on each side kept coming out from the dogs pushing in and out all the time so I just put 2 longer wide head nails in those bottom corners to hold better. Not really a design flaw, I just have 2 not so gentle 60 pound pups.

Ok if all you want to do is record people who come close to your door.  The downside of Ring is that all the porch pirates know Ring sends a low quality image and then  locks the users out for 3-8 minutes, which give the Porch Pirates 3 to 8 minutes safe escape.

  Good camera and the image quality is superior. However, one major issue is that the audio is having static noise. Google it and found large group of people is reporting this and the static noise can be hear next to the camera. So the noice is coming from the hardware and can’t be fixed by firmware. Hopefully they fix it from the source.

  The image quality is superb. The motion can be separated to detect normal motion or persons which is extremely helpful to minimize false positives. It is tiny, lightweight, easy to install and cheap.The only con so far is a somewhat diminished WiFi range compared to my previous v2 cam; not a whole bunch. However, the fact that this one is weather resistant compensates in my book.Pleased with my camera. Thumbs up for sure.

  Like a previous user, I also used a TDS (total dissolved solids) tester on my tap water in Southern California vs. this filter.  I've attached a photo of the results.  In summary, what am I paying for?  My tap water actually scored better than this filter.  This is a total waste of money and a fraud.  I'm seriously considering submitting this photo to our local news for their ""Fraudulent Products"" reporting segments.

  I very reluctantly ordered this because our semi-new fridge prompted that we needed to replace the filter.  When we bought the fridge, and learned it had a water filter, I thought that's nice, but had no idea that MayTag itself would not supply filters for their own products.  Instead, we're forced to search and research for someone that does sell replacement filters.  What we've learned is that this is a captured market and the manufacturers are gouging customers.  After you've spent a couple thousand on a new fridge that uses a water filter, you'll now need to spend $45+ every few months for filters, forever.  Anyhow, the morning after installing this overpriced junk, I opened the fridge and water just poured out everywhere.  It causes so much back pressure the connector and seals cannot handle it and the front shield that covers the filter fills up with water in a few minutes and then continues to flow and spill, continuously.  Lesson learned.  If you can find them, there are $18 versions of this filter that float around Amazon ever so often and they work perfectly.  A more sensibly priced and working version is at ""Compatible with Filter 2 Refrigerator Water Filter W10413645A W10413645 Kenmore 9082 (1-Pack)Sold by: apluschoice""

  These filters are a complete waste of money for what you get. First of all, they are almost $50 and in our house we are lucky if they last 3 months. After changing the filter you have to run like 8-10 gallons through it to get the cloudiness out and by then your filter is down to almost 90% if you go by what the fridge tells you.These filters also barely filter anything, does nothing for things like chlorine taste, etc.  Really displeased with this product and if I had know about this issue I would not have purchased my Whirlpool refridgerator.

  I used a TDS (total dissolved solids) tester on my tap water in Southern California the results were 442 ppm (parts per million)When I tested my refrigerator water using this new filter the results was 310.

  These seem to wear out really quick, and are pricey. Unfortunately that's the only thing that works for our refrigerator. Also, to get them started you are supposed to run some ridiculous amount of water through them to clean them (like 3-5 gallons). We usually go like 1/2 a gallon and just use it. It uses up like 7% of the filter just doing that initial part. Honestly, we just keep using it after it says it's done because the water tastes fine for a while. So, I guess they don't wear out as quick as they say they do...either that or we are just super cheap LOL.

  This ""FILTER2"" style filter performs well, giving excellent water quality at the dispenser and in ice cubes. The first few quarts dispensed by the in-door dispenser at first appeared cloudy, but when allowed to stand, quickly cleared since the cloudiness is actually very fine air bubbles.Flow decreases gradually as the fiilter loads with use as is expected of any filter doing its job. Our water in Palm Bay, FL has possibly lower particulates than average, so I was able to 'reset' the automatic reminder on our fridge (by removing and immediately reinstalling the same filter) several times before replacing the filter with a new one when flow decreased roughly by 50%.The filter itself consists of a thin cloth-like outer membrane surrounding an activated compressed powdered charcoal core. (See uploaded photos.) This might be compared to a 'finishing' filter in an RO system. If your fridge is connected to a reverse-osmosis system with such a filter, you might be able to skip replacement of this filter and only change the RO filters as needed.)I'm not sure why this filter is so expensive except that it's form-factor is quite specific to this model refrigerator and would be difficult to bypass or replace without considerable effort. Hence the 3 stars. This seems to be Whirlpool's attempt to tap into the 'subscription model' of continuous revenue after the sale for the life of the fridge. <mutter, grumble, grumble> :)

  Take the bad reviews with a grain of salt. It says on the label (in very small print) that you must FLUSH the filter with FOUR GALLONS OF WATER before use.The first gallon I flushed through was AWFUL. The water was gray and had lots of stuff floating in it. After the fourth gallon, it was running clean and clear, and the water tastes great.

  I have purchased many (and I mean many) magnetic screen doors all of which I have been disappointed with. I have several large dogs (100 ponds plus) and they are in and out all the time and none of the screen doors lasted even a month without something going wrong with it. So I was very surprised at this product right out of the box it look better and heavier duty than the previous screens I had purchased before. My dogs have not made any impact on this screen so far. Everything from the magnetics to the Velcro has held up with no wear at all. Screen is as good as when I pulled it out of the box. All the others that I have had would have the magnetics gone or screen tore by now. The magnetics are sewed into the screen (always had a problem with the others breaking off), the Velcro is also sewed in and not held by glue or tape. I also like that the Velcro is continuous not like some of the others I had that were only strips. I also like that the screen is one piece and not two which made it easier to install properly. The over all quality is great and would certainly recommend this product. In fact I was so pleased with how this screen is holding up that I purchased a second one. Great value for the money.Update: over 7 months now and the screen has held up. No issues at all. Love it!

  My wife has always bought the $10 specials of a similar magnetic mesh screen door that last about a month before they start to fall apart. I studied the Amazon ratings and prices and ordered this one. The package is 10 times as large and 3 times as thick as the $10 ones and the mesh fabric is much thicker and durable, along with full and not partial frame velcro. It has bigger and stronger magnets and a stay open feature. The similarity is like comparing a Mack Truck to a Tacoma.

  I just purchased this product and installed it last week. It was easy to put up and works great. I have a toddler constantly in and out of the house. I would have 30 to 40 flies most days buzzy arround. Since I have had seen 3 in a week.I am not sure how the Velcro attachment does through the weather this winter.Edited: it's been a year and it still good. Aside from kids chalk prints and a small tare from something pointy item we carried through. It's like new. Considering another for a second door.

  I cannot tell you if this works well. I had not measured my door correctly so when this arrived it did not fit.you must measure the outside of the door jamb that will accept the velcro.also, you must be able to put the velcro around the ENTIRE door jamb. on mine I have a transom immediately above the door jamb so the velcro cannot be adhered above the door.if your door does not fit exactly, there are no simple modifications you can make. well, you could but then you would end up doing as much work as if you made this yourself.i would return it but after the cost of paying for return shipping it isn't worth it. i am going to see if a neighbor want it instead. let my mistake save you some $$ and measure, measure, measure!i will add that the magnets seem strong. i wonder if my dog would tear the velcro off the door before opening up the magnet?

  It’s great for letting my kids and pets out easily. I don’t have to think about the screen door being left open anymore. Our 100lb dog runs through it daily. It’s still holding up after several months with no signs of wear. It seems like good quality durable fabric and it’s working for our family much better than a screen door. The magnets click together fast after going out and it keeps bugs out too.

  The concept of using this product, depends on what you're using it for. the first thing is it says it fits all types and styles of doors. This is incorrect, depending on the molding and just about any other design from a stock door will have a problem. I have a aluminum door that has a wood frame basically making it impossible for this to attach on the inside of the frame it's not designed it that way. So first off it will not fit all types of doors and styles. Secondly nowhere on the description does is say you will have to remove your existing screen door to use this. it's a design flaw that they do not make clear in their description. Being I have not used one of these before I thought I could simply place it on the door and be able to use the screen door as well. This also will be a problem for anyone that has heavy storm doors as it will not be able to be attached without carrying the thing off the wall. So not only is it a huge design flaw because they are stating it fits all types and styles of doors, it also requires that you remove your existing screen door to use this. A sliding screen door is even more problematic because you simply cannot work around it at all without removing a huge screen door and having to find a place to store it uses little plastic door hanger door.There is an issue with the to directions as well, it may sound silly but they do not state that you need to place this on the outside of the door. At first I was going to place it on the inside and I realized it could not because the door would move. Then try to place it on the outside and you also won't get there because the sliding screen door is in place which would have to be removed to use this product. As many of the reviews have questioned whether or not this works as a barrier to keep pets out. No it does not and it should be able to either if you're able to walk through it. But that also means you must eliminate any screen door you have because it will not work with this product.The material to attach is subpar, the Velcro material used is inexpensive bulk material that you could find a box store, and will not hold up defeat or constant removal. The dog was therefore to be removed if needed but you'll end up taking it probably write off the wall because the Velcro and the sticky material is only intended for light weight use.This particular Velcro is not designed for this application are using it on. I am sure many will find it falling off the wall after time and usage. The Velcro is simply not strong enough to hold it up against the wall. And the glue itself is not designed for the weighted and pull from opening and closing the magnetic drapes. It may work at first but over time there probably will be a problem unless one was to staple the sides and the top to a wooden frame there is an no way that glue is going to last more than a couple of months at the most.And finally the last thing that is not mentioned in the description. This is a very lightweight polyester that will melt. If you are carrying hot plates or anything out to your barbecue or back and forth you could easily burn this material and damage it. It is so thin that it would not take much heat at all to damage the material. Why the intent is to make it light weight so it functions and opens at the magnet entrance, this lightweight material also makes it subject to damage and problems with heat. Which reads really the point if this screen doors left out in direct sunlight the Velcro used and its adhesion will not stay put. One good hot summer and will most likely stop being adhesive.I had high hopes for this product, it's an amazing price and they boast a very promising experience. However the material is simply to lightweight, and applications do not fit the way they state. Any time someone says it will print anything or do anything I question it. I noticed when I tried to install this in the application we had it would not work. In fact I could think of many people that will have to remove their screen doors to use this particular one. Meaning you will have to either but the door back on after you're needing it or keep it removed and had this hanging outside.It's a good idea in concept, the material needs to be made out of fiberglass material or something a little more durable. Furthermore why it may raise the price to do so they should be using commercial adhesive, and commercial grade Velcro. The step being used is not heavy-duty grade material for constant use. Depending on where you live polyester material like this can degrade in UV light pretty quickly. Again something that is not mentioned.These are why I cannot say this is a must buy.It does not fit all doors as claimed.It has poor adhesive Velcro qualities.May require removing your current screen door to use.Does not state heat or fire resistant, so the assumption is its standard polyester plastic material.Directions to not state whether these should be installed on the outside or inside of the doors.

  The OEM filters are pricey, but to me they're worth every penny. I have looked all around for any other alternative that is rated as highly as these for contaminant reduction and there are none. I cannot find a single filter that replaces UKF8001 that is both NSF/ANSI 42 and NSF/ANSI 53, let alone NSF/ANSI 401 as well! All the cheaper, non-OEM filters that I have seen are NSF 42 only, if certified at all. I don't see the point in wasting money on a cheap filter that may not actually be filtering anything instead of paying up for a filter that filters contaminants like Naproxen and DEET out of the water. Do yourself a favor: if you're actually trying to filter your water, get this filter. I've had 4 now, all worked perfectly.

  I went through 2 of these filters now.  the result SLOW FLOW!!!  i believe i found the cause to the problem.  If you would happen to look at your bypass cap that comes with the fridge and the filter and see the 2 parts that are raised inside the cap.  The cap is raised higher than on the filter which would allow it to push the flow valve in further causing more water to flow.  I believe on the filters it's not pushing the valves in far enough to allow a good water flow.  the plastic mold isn't correct when they created the filters.  The filtering isn't the issue it's the actual plastic mold itself I believe is the issue.  Quite a shame for something that's so pricey.

  The flow rate on this filter (0.8gpm) is so much better than the generic replacement I had bought while trying to save money (0.5gpm,) that it's easily worth the premium price (and this Amazon price is better than I found anywhere else.) I had a store brand filter from T H*ME D**OT in my Maytag french door refrigerator.  You can see in my attached photo the difference in design: This filter, on the right, is larger, and has more holes for the water to flow.  The family complained that it took too long to fill glasses; the Keurig reservoir took FOREVER!  I timed the old one, it took almost exactly 60 seconds to fill a 1 quart jug.  This new Everydrop filter filled the same jug in 32 seconds.

  Tip from refrigerator repairman who replaced a part on my Kitchen-aid KFXS25RYMS0:  Buy a tube of food grade white grease -- bought mine on www.smile.amazon.com -- and whenever you replace your refrigerator filter, apply a tiny amount to gaskets and any places that touch.  This will prevent the part that seats the filter from wearing and losing its seal and leaking.  The smallest tube of this stuff will last two lifetimes.As for the filter itself, it seems quite good but I believe the manufacturer is way too proud of its product.  Almost $100 for water filters?  Hm-m . . .

  The filter was working fine for about a month.  I was able to draw more than a cup of water with solid pressure from the water dispenser.  After about a month the filter is now causing the water dispenser to make a loud noise when drawing water and the pressure is really low and slow.I've been able to narrow the problem down to the filter.  Reinstalling the old filter or using the By Pass Cap gets rid of the loud noise so the problem is with the new filter.  I've bought these before when Amazon was selling the two pack and they worked great, I used them for about a year with no issues (reduced water pressure as the filter approached a year).  I'm not sure what has changed but upon a little research it seems others are having problems with the newer model filters.  They aren't made as well and now cost more than the previous ones, perhaps due to poor quality control since this item is 5 star rated and only a few people are having this problem.I wish there were more consumer options when it came to refrigerator filters.  There are only a handful of manufacturers and the off brand filters don't have as many reviews but I will be giving those a try next since I've had a bad experience with this name brand filter and Amazon's support.I'm no longer able to return the product, however I've used the Amazon ""Get product support"" option and received no reply.

  This filter does cost more, but it fits and works.  I bought a 4 pack on eBay for $65.  Great deal?  Nope.  The filters look identical and are packaged identically to the real product, except for a sticker placed over the made in America printing.  I tried all four and all four wouldn’t seal because they wouldn’t twist on far enough!  They also had unwashed carbon and turned the water black.  I tried to flush the one that slightly leaked, but even after about 3 gallons the water was still black.  I put the old filter back in and everything was fine.  I ordered this ‘real’ OEM one from amazon, installed it with no leaking and it’s just as it should be.  I did get a refund from the eBay merchant, but they didn’t want their filters back.  Dont waste your time with the $16 knockoffs!

   This filter is an upgrade to the recommended filter for our 2012 side by side KitchenAid refrigerator.The old filter never removed the strong chlorine smell we have with our public water supply; this one did-that's one reason why I gave it 5 stars.I added a picture of the old filter that this one replaced.Although the filter may seem expensive,  I find the Amazon price is better than other retailers who sell this filter. You can always buy several of them at once and save even more money.Plus, it’s a quality water filter and I feel that’s worth some peace of mind.Check out my video showing the install process.If my review was useful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.Thank you.

  I remember being completely dumbfounded by my pencil eraser as a kid. Where did the marks go? I looked in the air, I looked under my paper. What's it made of? Does it have to be pink?This carpet cleaner caused the same dumbfounded confusion when ""spray, rub, gone"" actually worked. I've obviously lost some of my childhood curiosity over the years, because I didn't try to figure out how the carpet stain disappeared. Who cares? It's gone! I practically skipped to the next room to try it out. The memory smudge of food, footprints, dog vomit. Gone. It even worked SOMEWHAT on the decade old mystery stain left behind by the previous owners that professional carpet cleaning couldn't remove.How does it work? I don't care.What are the ingredients? Pixie dust and incantation.Where did all the stains go? Away.

  I had a carpet stain from an air purifier that wouldn't budge with my typical store bought, go-to product.  With all the positive reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  I followed the instructions and tested it in an inconspicuous spot for color fastness.  No issue, so I proceeded to spray it on my stain.  It not only lifted the stain, but it also lifted the color of my carpet.  Now I am left with an area that looks much worse than when I started.  And what is up with the NO RETURN policy for this item??  My next step is to contact the company, as it states (on the back of the bottle) that it comes with a 100% money back guarantee.  I contacted the company and they said that they do not sell their product on Amazon.  Therefore, I do not qualify for the 100% money back guarantee.

  The product itself is great.  Removes stains perfectly.One star is for how we received it and for the non response when we reported it.Package came completely soaked. Upon further investigation bottle was sealed with plastic wrap but top was not screwed on completely, allowing for the liquid to seek out. So basically we received an empty bottle of Folex. Doesn’t do us much hood. Will not purchase again.

  So, instead of asking for recommendations, I want to give one.I skimmed an article about amazing cleaning products, and was drawn to this carpet stain remover. Sounded great, especially for the cost. So I got it and tried it on an old doggie pee stain I cannot remove. Well it worked, and it was so fast and easy to use. Spray, rub in with fingers or a scrub brush, wipe up with a dry cloth. Poof - stain is gone! I told my husband, I don't even care if the stain comes back, I'll do that once a week - worth it!STAIN CAME BACK. So a few weeks later, the stain came back, I repeated the process but with more saturation, and more scrubbing. I know it's gross, but I smelled the rag to see if it smelled like dog pee - IT DID. So although I've tried 10 ways to get the stain up, this product actually gets 4 month old, repeatedly cleaned, dog pee stains out of carpets. Just wanted to share because I am in love!!!If the stain comes back, it's needs more spraying, scrubbing, and wiping. That's all.

  WOW! A must have for any home.  My carpet had some mystery stains that other stain remover products could not budge.  I had resigned myself to never having them any better, until I found this product.  It was very easy, spray it on, then put a paper towel on top and it disappears. Seriously!  Included some pictures of before/after results after first use.  There were a couple that I had to go back for a second time, but after having lived with these carpet blemishes for years... I was more than happy.  I even used it on a cushion, you don't have to worry about harmful chemicals. You also get a lot of cleaner for your money, I was surprised at how big the bottle was, and you do not need to use lots when you apply, so this will last a very long time.

  My car is over ten years old and my cloth grey seats are a bit grimey. The driver's seat and arm rest is pretty dirty due to my sweaty thighs and arms after working out (I should buy a seat cover lol).This product was easy to use. Just spray very generously (when you spray and it looks like the stain disappears after spraying, you know you sprayed enough), I rubbed it in with my fingers, a scrub brush, and a mirofiber towel (I found that a dry mirofiber towel worked best) then let it dry!Some parts I'm going to have to go over because it wasn't until later I figured out a good technique, but for first time use I think this product did pretty well, just look at the pictures!!The last picture of the back seat of my car, I wish I had a before (posted is the after). There were a lot of orange looking ring stains back there on the middle seat. I sprayed and rubbed with a towel and let it dry and was surprised to see it look clean the next day!I was surprised because usually with cleaners, the liquid just spreads the dirty stains to a new area and dries still stained, but not with this product!

  It’s a miracle in a bottle. My German Shepherd Mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping — this cleaner lifted the stain and now it’s like the devastation my dog caused never happened!

  I use a small single-strap head lamp very frequently for my craft work as it requires that I see very small pieces and details with as much clarity as I can possibly get, so there are 3 things I must have in a headlamp: It must be comfortable to wear straight on my head without a hat underneath, it must be lightweight as I'm frequently bending  my head over and looking down at my work, and it must be as bright as possible.This head lamp hits all 3 marks.Of the past 4 different 'small single-strap' head lamps I've had, this one is just as light, the strap is very strong and is not likely to ever stretch out and become loose and floppy, and this one is the BRIGHTEST of all of them by far.The light fixture itself is plastic and is not the kind of lamp you'd want if you do nighttime construction work or the like, unless you're really gentle with it. But then again, it's so inexpensive that you can buy half a dozen of these for the price of some of the heavy-duty metal ones.If I lost or damaged both of these somehow - I would immediately buy them again without even needing to look at any others. For light-duty, these are really good and I would definitely recommend them.Also, the seller has been communicating to make sure I like them from the day they shipped. So that's another plus.

  My 3 year old always asks to play with my headlamp so I figured id buy him his own. I didn't expect much out of these for the price, but I was blown away when I put batteries in. These lights are incredibly bright and lightweight. The light offers low, medium, high and strobe for the white LED and turns on with low mode first which I really like. The red LEDs offer ""on"", SOS, and strobe. Build quality seems solid. The band is comfortable and I was able to adjust it small enough for my son as well as myself. The red LEDs are a great extra feature and are very bright as well. I haven't been able to test battery life yet, but I'm sure it's decent.  Will definitely look for more lights from this company.

  Bought these for my kids for camping 3&5yo and they are AMAZING. Super bright and several different light (flashing, red and brightness) levels with adjustable tilting up and down . The kids have already figured it out. I was so impressed (and we are strictly PETZL people- avid hikers, night trail runners etc) that I purchased a second set for us adults. Plan on buying one or two more sets just to have as backup in house and in the car etc. Can't have too many headlamps that's for sure. Even with my kids abusing the headlamps I have yet to have to change the battery and they are still super bright. Would be amazing stocking stuffers or gifts and no one would know you didn't spend a fortune!Tip- If you have kids that will fight over them: I had my daughter use a pink sharpie to color in the white logo on the head band and my son use a blue sharpie. Boom....no more fights they can tell whose is whose!

  I have several higher end flashlights (streamlight, surefire, etc) but just wanted something I could use when walking the dog and ordered these while I was on vacation and they were quickly available from Amazon. The quality is very good and they work perfectly. They are very bright and easy to operate. I also wanted to use while reading in bed and my only wish would be that the ""low"" setting was not as bright (kind of an odd complaint when referring to a flashlight). Anyway, I think they are an exceptional value and recommend them highly. There was no statement as to lumens for each setting but I estimate the high setting to be about 150-200 and the low to still be >50 lumens.

She Followed the directions to a T for the second time.  She went through two full bottles and the Ninja coffee maker clean light is still on.Do not recommend!For single cup coffeemakers, use only one capful of CLR. Run through coffee maker as if making coffee. Rinse thoroughly by running two full pots of cold, clean water through a complete cycle. ... *Do not use CLR in espresso machines.I did this and in two cycles the light turned off.  BUY CLR!

  Easy to use and works great! In the past I'd tried cleaning my Keurig with ACV (horrible if you don't get it all out and it curdles the creamer). I also tried simply flushing with water alone which worked for about two days. This is less expensive than the name brand for four uses, I think it has no smell (someone complained about that in a review...not sure what they're talking about), and my Keurig is brewing faster and actually looks cleaner in the reservoir. The solution is a little soapy in appearance, I followed the instructions, used half a bottle, ran a brew cycle til it said add water (all this involves lots of dumping the cup each time), then I filled the reservoir with water and did it again, then I did just water for a second time for a total of 3 times per the instructions. This is three cycles to empty not just three brews. At the end I dumped the lingering water out and cleaned the reservoir, filled it and the next morning had a great cup of coffee. I personally think anyone who had issues using this either didn't follow directions (as a teacher for nearly a decade I know that's most likely) or are just a troll looking to be a grouch. I use my Keurig 2-3 a day every day.

  I was having issues with the temperature on my Breville Barista Express BES870XL. I was getting very, very cold drinks after brewing. I didn't know what the issue was. I even descaled the unit with a universal descaler from Essential Values - Coffee Machine Descaler & Cleaner and ran a cleaning tablet, but the brewing was still very, very cold. It was making my espresso drinks hard to drink. I was thinking my machine was broken.So this week, I had the courage to try again and put up more money for a different descaler this time. I tried this Descaler and oh, boy did this made a huge difference. My espresso drinks are now very hot and tasty. Boy, am I glad i tried this. Thank you to this Universal Descaler. : ) :) :)

  It's lovely to have a solution to dilute for descaling rather than creating my own as I have in the past.  I would suggest that in the instructions, you add a third and perhaps fourth emptying of the water reservoir.  That unmistakable taste (vinegar-like) remains after the instructions are complete.  Now that I know this, I will ""rinse"" more thoroughly.  Thank you.....Susan Peter

  i had my keurig for 4 years and never knew about ""descaling."" Well within the last week, my keurig would take forever to cycle water and my cups would be half as full. i used this as directed, and its like new again!!! you can get 2 uses out of one bottle but MAKE SURE you cycle enough water through your machine after you use this or your coffee will taste funky and im sure isnt good for you!

  Descaled my Keurig admirably. Takes a while to follow the instructions completely as they require multiple cycles of brewing hot water, sitting, and repeat. But follow them CLOSELY with ALL THE CYCLES or you will make acidic coffee that you will sip and then spit on your freshly descaled coffeemaker....ask me how I know.I hear citric acid is a less expensive alternative, but this stuff works fine for me and is not more than I need. I do this every couple of months because it doesn't seem necessary every month for our household of 2 coffee and tea drinkers.

  This light is very bright if you face the LEDs toward the table. And it gently illuminates the underside of a patio umbrella if the LEDs are faced up and at its highest power. Holds well to a wooden umbrella pole and is very easy to operate the latch that allows you to remove or install the light onto the pole. Batteries last a good long time in this light. Highly recommended.Update: July 23 2017 another customer asked if these would fit his umbrella pole with a diameter of 2.5 inches. I measured it with my calipers and the maximum pole diameter would be an inch and a half.

  Each time you push the on/off button the setting changes - it rotates through 4 settings- OFF, 4 LEDs on, 24 LEDs on or 28 LEDs on. The light is a bright white, which is exactly what I wanted..To attach the device to the umbrella pole, you have to open the device.  There are no written instructions for opening the device and it is not intuitively obvious.  Actually, it was counter intuitive to me.  There is a latch which looks like a sliding button, but it does not slide.  You have to pull it out and that will open the device so it can be attached to the umbrella pole.  It is easy to operate once you know to pull rather than slide.You can leave the device on the pole when you crack down the umbrella.  When I crank the umbrella down, the umbrella ""runner"" pushes the light down the pole.  I have no problem leaving the light on the pole and tying the umbrella canopy down.  When I open the umbrella, I do have to push the light back up the pole.Some reviews said that the light was always on.  The ""on/off"" button on one of the two devices I bought was broken and did not contact at all, so when the batteries were installed, the lights were on.  Removing 1 battery turned the light off.  I contacted the Seller and they are sending a replacement for the broken device.  The other light worked as designed.The plastic switches may be the weak link in the device.  I noticed many reviews complaining about not being able to turn the lights off and based on my experience presume it may be the button.  The seller was quite willing to replace the faulty device.I expect to buy more of these lights when I buy more umbrellas.  I may even use them elsewhere in the yard - they work even without an umbrella pole!  I will recommend these to friends as well.5/21/2018 Update.  The seller promptly sent the replacement light, but I was unable to try it until tonight.  It works perfectly.  And it is definitely bright enough to read by.

  I like to go out on my patio in the evenings to sip a beverage and smoke a cigar. Most times I take my phone and bluetooth speaker with me as well so I can listen to music. The back door light was always too bright so after I purchased an umbrella for my patio table I found the OYOCCO light and decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it. It adds a nice ambience to my outdoor space and just the right amount of light. Great product.

  I bought two of these lights for our outside umbrellas.  What i like the most is you can turn them so lighting is up or down.  They have 3 settings which is great. They are very bright and most of all for the price they can't be beat!  I have them stored without batteries in them and then when we need them just place the batteries in and put it on the umbrella .  Pretty simple.  They say they are NOT waterproof and from looking at how they are made I would agree.  The only downside that I can see is the clip that holds the 2 halves together.  I would stronglly suggest that you take your time when clipping and unclipping the latch as it is plastic and not sure how strong it is.

  Awesome umbrella light, so glad I ordered this! Opens up, and clips shut around umbrella pole. Spring loaded braces ensure the light stays in place but easily maneuvers higher or lower to adjust needed light. 3 different light settings from low, medium, and high allow you the best options for outdoor entertaining. This was money well spent! Be sure you measure your umbrella pole circumference though, just to be sure this is the right size you need. Aim lights up at bottom of umbrella for less light or ambience, aim them downward onto table for family game night and while eating dinner. This was actually the perfect solution for my patio set up to bring plenty of light.

  Very happy with our light and particularly like the three levels of lighting provided...just add four AA batteries and you are good to go.Note that this unit is NOT waterproof so needs to be removed (takes 5 seconds!) from the umbrella when not in use. We left ours outside and it filled with rainwater. The good news is that we emptied it out and dried everything off and it still works like a charm. Nice product.

  This is a great solution to lighting an umbrella-shrouded table without an extension cord. It is easy to install the batteries and easy to mount to the umbrella pole. I recommend mounting it just under the umbrella's thin metal extension arms unit that moves up and down the pole. That allows the umbrella to close in a normal fasion without having to remove the light.I rated the bright light setting as a nine since moving from medium to bright does not add much extra light. I suggest that you don't let that deter you on buying this item as the light still offers a pleasant, intimate effect.

  I've been trying to kick soda for a while with limited success. For a while flavored carbonated water helped because I never liked tap water. It took me a bit to realize my problem is that tap water wasn't cold enough. I started mixing tap water with ice to get it colder but I have to let it sit first and ice limits the capacity of water. I also noticed after a few ice waters I could see residue inside the glass because either the ice or my tap water isn't clean enough. Moving to this finally solved my issues because I get clean filtered water that's cold enough without adding ice. It's simple to keep filled and it quickly paid for itself through buying less soda and fizzy water. Keeping enough cans of soda and fizzy water was the most difficult part of my grocery shopping. Now if I want to add flavor I use MiO or one of the other simple additives that are still cheaper and easier than buying cases of soda. Giving your body enough water intake is one of the best things you can do for yourself. When you are done buying one gift one to someone you care about.

  This is a good pitcher and fits nicely in the refrigerator.  However, the shape of the handle makes it hard to hold in one hand when filled with water. The handle is curved and the slippery thumb grip makes it difficult to hold level.  Also, the lid doesn't have a gasket to prevent the water from leaking from the upper chamber when it is full.  Therefore, you have to wait until all the water filters down before you can start pouring, which takes a relatively long time.

  This was my first time using these bags and they are the absolute worst! My 11 year old son usually takes out the trash so we are always sure to not overfill the bags. He started telling us that the top of the bags would rip as he was taking the trash out. I thought maybe he was pulling the drawstring too tight until I took the trash out myself one day. The bags would begin ripping from the top every single time. This is a large box and we were already past the return date so we continued to use them and just decided we would never buy these again. Well this past week my husband took the trash out instead of my son and on his way out the entire bag split open from the bottom. There was trash and food everywhere on my CARPETED steps!!! Now I have to get my carpet cleaned! It was very frustrating to have to clean this up. Thank goodness my son wasn't the one taking the trash out this time. I emailed the company to let them know of the poor quality of their product and of course no reply! I'm holding on to the remainder of the bags in case they ever do contact me for more info but I will not use these again. DO NOT BUY!!!

  This is truly a 1-star review, but I gave it 5-stars to alert people to refer to all of the new 1-star reviews after Hefty redesigned the bags.  I've been buying 13 gallon trash bags by Hefty for years.  Suddenly the bags are smaller the old trash bags I bought a few months ago.  They aren't long enough to fold over the lip of my trash can like Hefty's old 13 gallon bags.  Once full of trash, they fall down into the trash can and rip open almost every time I pull it out of the trash can.  This was never a problem before with Hefty's true 13 gallon bags.  Hefty has definitely put profits over quality on the ""new and improved"" revision of this bag.  They made the plastic thinner and reduced the size of the bag significantly while still calling it a 13 gallon bag.  I checked the box and the previous bags were 23.75"" Wide and 27"" Tall.  These ""new and improved"" Hefty 13 gallon bags are only 24-7/8"" tall.  They cut off a few inches hoping no one would notice.  The new bags are 0.9 mil thickness.UPDATE 16/JAN/2021 - I can't wait to be finished with these horrible bags.  Hefty sure tricked me on this purchase.  They are too small for my 13 gallon trash can and they continually rip when I pull them out.  They also fall down inside the trash bin because they are a few inches shorter than the normal 13 gallon bags.  Due to their size, we are using twice as many trash bags as we were before.

  I have used this brand of bags for awhile, but this most recent box I purchased through Amazon is of exceptionally poor quality.  Liquid seeps slowly out of the bottom of the bags, even though they have no visible holes.  I am about halfway through a box of 80ct bags, and have had this issue with nearly all of the bags on this roll.  I recently switched to the second roll from this box, which appears to have the same issue.In addition to the seepage issue, these bags also puncture very easily now - an issue that I don't recall having with previous boxes.  Just in the process of lifting the bag from my trash can, I have punctured several bags with my fingernails, which are trimmed barely beyond the tips of my fingers and are regularly filed and cared for.  I'm hoping that this is reflective of a quality issue they had with a specific run of product, rather than a design or materials change that is causing these issues that should be expected from this point forward in their manufacture line.

  Hefty seems to have decided to replace their old scented arm and hammer bags with these. They don't even compare to the old ones. I've only used 3 of the 80 bags so far and every one of them has gotten multiple holes in them with the slightest touch. 1st bag got two holes just putting it on the trash can. 2nd one i was very careful putting on the can. it got holes when i took it off the can. 3rd one i was careful putting it on and off, but when i went to take the bag outside not only did it get a hole, the built in string broke with very limited effort trying to tie it closed. I've still got 77 of these and i'm looking forward to the day when they're done so i can try a different brand. Hopefully these don't cause any major accidents in the near future before they're all gone. I would not recommend these bags to anyone for any reason.

  I was looking through reviews before I bought these and almost decided not to purchase then based on some of the reiews.  I wanted black trash bags for my kitchen so that my trash and messes in my trash bag would not be seen.  I have been using another name brand but become frustrated when the ties would constanted break and the bags would tear so I decided to try these Hefty Ultra Strong bags.  I have used Hefty bags before but it has been a few years.  I really can't remember why I stopped using them.  I think I just found some that were cheaper and went with them.  Sometimes cheaper isn't always better in the long run.  So , I am back with Hefty and I am glad I didn't let some of the negative reviews stop me from purchasing these.I have a Rubbermaid Step-On trash can (step on and the lid opens) and they fit around the top of the oval lid great.  I have not had any problem with them slipping off and sliding down in the trash can.  When I take the trash out of the can , I end up stuffing more in the bag and it stretches decently.  I will admit the bags looked a little thinner than I remember the Hefty bags I purchased before being but I haven't had any to tear and they gray drawstings are sturdy enough and haven't broke.I like these bags enough that I am going to to start purchasing them regulary.

  This product works just fine. I have to order it about once every six months or so for our Frigidaire French door refrigerator. My only complaint is the high price of this item. Amazon used to offer an off-brand alternative, but it disappeared after I ordered it the first time. I wish I had stocked up when I had the chance.

  I’ve had this air purifier for over a year and have replaced the filters about once every 2-3 months. However, when I received the filter I ordered a week or two ago, I was surprised that the black carbon layer had been changed. It’s similar to felt. Because of this new change, my air purifier is working OVERTIME. It’s insanely loud, and has to be vacuumed daily (which isn’t very helpful, whereas the original one was easy to clean and significantly decreased the loudness). Vacuuming it daily doesn’t help. The new carbon layer is thick and clogs almost immediately. I’m really disappointed with this product. The original one was great, why fix what isn’t broken? This new filter is really testing the limits of my (very expensive) air purifier.

  I got my Germ Guardian 6 months ago and just recently my red light came in to change the filter. I was looking at the reviews on Amazon and saw that there were mixed reactions. I still purchased because some were positive and the price was better than other places! I’ve tried to touch on some of the concerning reviews I’ve seen and how my experience was similar/different.Packaging: The package appeared to be just as expected.Change in appearance: I saw a review that talked about how the filter Looked different and could be a knock off, but this doesn’t seem to be the case. My filter looked like it was good quality and there was an insert that talked about how the product was just redesigned to be efficient so it may look differentlyInstallation: Installation was super easy and the machine had helpful labels.Frequency: I now know I should have been cleaning the black filter (not the white accordion filter) monthly so I’ll begin doing that. It recommends changing the entire filter every 6 months which is right when the light came on.Red to Green Light: I saw someone post that their light was still blinking - After changing the filter just hold down the UV button for about 5 seconds and it will reset the light.Overall, works great and many of the concerns I had previously from the reviews ended up being manageable! Save money and just purchase from Amazon. You can even set up automatic delivery for 6 months.

  UPDATE 2/24/19:So I've been using the new filters in my germguard and just received the flashing light saying I need to change filters. Really unimpressed with the changes (thinner, doesn't fit snugly), especially since I've been feeling like my allergies are a lot worse since replacing the older filters. For that reason, I've decided to try another brand vs wasting my money on this.Also tried contacting their customer service per the comment they left on this review and received NO response. Just some added food for thought if you wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt like I did.**************************************************Really disappointed with the new ""upgrade"" to these filters. I have one of the older ones with the black foam border, and then just received a yellow plastic border. The older version fit snugly; the yellow one continually falls out when I try to set it into my GemGuardian. Just replaced today, so I can't speak to how effective it is and whether it's the same in quality as the older version, but we'll see, as I've got the older filter running in my living room, and the yellow/replacement in my bedroom.As an aside: I'm also disappointed because the light on the machine receiving this filter is no longer working, and it's difficult to find the proper replacement for my model AC4825. Double whammy of disappointment with my GermGuardian right now :(

  I bought this product about 2 months ago and just now tried to change the filter on my GermGuardian AC4825 22” 3-in-1 air purifier.  The product that came out of the package was not same as the replacement filter I had previously purchased directly from the manufacturer. I was disappointed that it was a knock-off, but I still tried it out. However, it simply did not work. I took off the black carbon filter to see if it would work then, but it still didn't work. There was no noise coming from the air purifier.  Finally, I put the old/dirty filter back into the air purifier, and it started to work again. So basically this product is a waste of your money. Don't buy it. Because this product comes in a box that's identical to the original, you can't tell it's a knock-off until you open it and see that it's not the same quality (it feels really cheap), and there's no instructions on the side (like the original).

  My husband decided to take up snoring as a hobby so earplugs seemed a better solution to smothering him in his sleep. I've been through countless types of the orange faom ones, they just end up hurting my ears and/or falling out so I end up with what looks like a bed full of cheetos. So I decided to try Mack's. I will never go back. these things are amazing. They actually block out the noise of my husband's endless nocturnal pursuit of protecting me from bears by obstructed breathing. They don't hurt my ears and they don't fall out. Finally I can get a good night's sleep.

  These go ON your ears, not in them. I fly internationally nearly every year, usually across the Pacific, and wind up wearing earplugs for up to 13 hours (apart from meals), because the sustained drone of jetliners' engines are not good for your hearing. But your ear canals don't like that. They feature a thin layer of skin over bone and damage easily. That's why doctors say you should never put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear. And I can say from long experience that conventional foam earplugs are irritating during long use like what I describe here. But these silicone earplugs go over your ear canal, using the qualities of silicone to adhere to the ear around the ear canal. That's the theory. And in this case it's also the practice. I lost mine before returning on my last trip and had to make do with the free earplug provided by the airline, and it reminded me of how great these silicone on-the-ear plugs are. If you try them I doubt you'll go back, and they're cheap enough to try. You can dispose of a pair after using it, but I've found you can re-use them quite a bit BTW.

  Best earplugs I have ever used.  They really do work although there is a slight learning curve on how to properly use.... you don't squish them and stick them in your ear like other ear plugs!  Instead they need to cover the outer opening to your ear.  Not too much squishing involved, they should stay nearly round when in use.  Really blocks out even loud snoring sounds

  Love these! I'm a super light sleeper so have to wear earplugs nightly. But after using foam ones regularly for over a year my ears were constantly irritated, sore and throbbing. I have small ears and even the foam plugs made for women and small ears just killed me. Finally, my ENT recommended these. I'll never go back to foam! I've been wearing these every night for seven months now with no pain. I like that they're really easy to wash too, since they're silicone. I do have small ears so I break one plug in half and use 1/2 per ear. This is just the right size for me but there are specific instructions included for use.

  Flatten the earplug, then place it over the ear canal. Then press it into place at 12, 3 6, 9, like the face of a clock. I have used these for years and they work excellent. I read alot of the reviews and people are either inserting them into the ear canal or complaining there to soft. They have to be soft to adhere to the skin in your ear. These work excellent, exspecialy if you have noisy neighbors, like me.

  I have an awful coworker that I can hear eating her carrots, chips, etc THROUGH A CLOSED DOOR while I’m WEARING OVER EAR HEADPHONES. I also have a family living above me that lets their children run from one end of the condo to the other until sometimes 11 at night. You could say I’m sensitive to noise. Well these are super comfy and I have no issues wearing them for long periods. Can’t hear anything when they’re in. Sometimes I sleep in them, and if I put my phone next to my head I can still hear my alarm in he morning since it is so close. Very sound deadening if you get a proper seal. Only con is my hair gets stuck in the silicone.

  It blocks the sound effectively but it leaves a waxy residue in my ears so it feels like my ears are full of earwax.  Also the process of putting them in can hurt. To prevent this, warm the earplugs a bit in your hands before pressing them into place.  Directions are included with the packaging as these are not your standard kind of earplugs.

  My bf snores. Loud. We have wood floors in the bedroom  and the dogs. If the dogs walk around, you hear it. Wonderful in the middle of the night. I have tried every year plug imaginable. I can still hear stuff. I tried these on a whim and oh my God! You cannot hear anything. Nothing. I don't hear the fan, the dogs, or my boyfriend snoring.  I do however hear my alarm because I set it super high. But even then it's low. It's a good thing I'm a light sleeper.  I find them super easy to use. You just soften them up with your fingers- really pliable. I do what they tell you not to do but it works awesome for me.I basically put it in my ear and shove down with my thumb. That's it. It doesn't go into my ear canal and when it's time to be removed you just pull it right out. I don't find a problem with it but others in may. The only  problem I have is I have very long hair and it tends to get caught in the wax. You can just pull it out and slide the waxy pieces off your hair. I remedy most of the problem by wearing my hair up.  Oh, they are reusable, I've used the same pair for a while. When they get gross I throw them out. If you have smaller ears, you can use half of one and that works good too. But be careful -it is smaller in your ear canal. Other than that, I would recommend with more than five stars if I could. Amazing.

  From left to right in photos Slim Fit (purple), Dream Girls (pink), Snore Blockers (green), Original (aqua), Ultra Soft (brown). I have read other reviews stating that macks changed the size of the Ultra Soft recently, so I am posting a photo of the packaging for mine. The Ultra Soft are my favorite (even though they are not an exciting color) because they block noise, compress really well so that they are easy to insert, and don't feel like they are forcibly pushing against my ear canal once they have expanded.  The Originals are a close second (just a bit shorter and slightly more slender than the Ultra Soft), so I will use them as well.  I found that the Slim Fit were somehow hard to get into my ears (in spite of being slim) and didn't block enough noise.  The Dream Girls fit really well but usually didn't stay in all night (and I sometimes  worried they would get shoved down too far to get out). The Snore Blockers truly block the most noise, but they push too hard against my ear canal to be comfortable for long periods.  The Macks brand ear plugs have not caused irritation or itching in my ears (other brands have), but I throw them away after one use so I can't speak to durability.  Wish I could say that I received a discount in my quest for the perfect plug, but I purchased all at full price on Amazon and just decided to write a review comparing them because I had a hard time differentiating based on the product descriptions.

  What happened? These used to be made from angel fat. The squishiest earplug out there. Now, they are as hard as a correction officers eyeballs. These are no different than the other ear plugs. I have plugs from other containers, still, and these are like they’ve been left in a microwave oven too long.  They feel just like everyone else’s plugs. Soooo very disappointed.Did y’all change the formula? The method of manufacture? The source? These are NOT ultra soft.

  UPDATE: I was able to exchange these and got the smaller ones (as shown in the picture from my earlier review), which was great. Just reordered and got the bigger ones again. They have definitely changed their product without saying anything. These are not better. They don't stay in my ears at all, or block any sound. On to new earplugs due to product change...AGAIN.I just requested an exchange because either the package I received is defective or Macks has changed this product. The new container I received has ear plugs that are a slightly different color and that are bigger than the last 2 containers. Concerned because these had been working perfectly and the new ones don't stay in my ears at all and don't block any sound whatsoever. If the new package is the same as what I got most recently, I'll be shopping for new ear plugs again.

  I ordered these a year ago in October 2015 and they were the best earplugs I've ever used. I ran out October 2016 and placed an order for more and the newer earplugs are some of the worst I have used. The good ones (pictured left) are noticeably shorter and fatter and appear to have a smooth glossy finish.  The bad ones (pictured right) are taller and thinner. They are skinny and do not do a good job of creating a seal.  The noise they block out is significantly less than the old design likely due to the bad seal and more porous foam used.Buyer Beware, many of the 5-star reviews are for the old design.  If anyone finds earplugs that are similar to the old design, please let me know!

  As other reviews mentioned, something seems to have changed and not really for the better. While these new ones do feel a little better in my ears, I've found they don't last nearly as long and actually have popped out on me a few times. I use these to sleep, cut the grass, and go to the races. The old version I could use 1 pair at night for almost 2 weeks. These new ones are trash after 2-3 nights tops, and I have to take multiple pairs to the race track with me in order to last the entire day (7a-8p). Will likely be trying a different brand soon and donating these or keeping them in my suitcase for backup on trips.UPDATE: Had to go from 3 stars down to 1. I've tried for a couple months now to make these work and they simply don't. In order to get them to stay in you have to jam them dangerously deep into your ears, hurt like crazy, and even then they don't block out that much sound. If you insert then just a little more shallow so they don't hurt, they pop right out and they barely even muffle noise. There's been times when they were ""in"" and then fell out and I never knew because there was no difference in noise reduction. Whenever they updated this product, they took a MAJOR leap backwards. 2 years ago, the product was perfect. Now I'm throwing most of this container away and ordering from another company.

  My boyfriend snores like a buffalo! We have already started sleeping in separate rooms (we both can actually sleep now, I love it!!). But vacations had turned into something I dread!We just got back from a 10 day southwest vacation, which is why I bought these! I've tried many other ear plugs. They sort of work, but hurt my ears as I'm a side-sleeper.I brought three different plugs to try on this last vaca. Happened to use these Mack's first. Didn't even waste my time on the other two. These are squishy enough to completely plug your ears, and also squishy enough not to hurt your ears. I can sleep with them in all night! I couldn't even hear the alarm clock at all. And I was able to sleep next to a lumberjack (sawing logs, lol) all night!!Just make sure you put them in correctly. Roll between your fingers and make as thin as possible, then stick one in as far as you can and hold. You'll get the feel for it. They really are awesome!!

  i dont understand.  I have been buying these oem filters for years now.  I never purchased directly from AMAZON but this time automatically ordered through the dash button the purchase automatically went to AMAZON and not the vendors I use to purchase from.  Also weird is that there are no other vendors that sell the OEM when I do a search now on Amazon.  You can only find aftermarket ones through other vendors.  The water is cloudy and chalky and its definitely not from air bubbles.  There is a residue and chalk in the cup and this is after a few days and even putting it through a britta filter still cloudy.  The water is CRYSTAL CLEAR when we put a bypass filter.  Did they change manufacturers?  Are these fake? I have NEVER had any issues in the past until now.  I returned the first one and received the second one two days later  and same results  CLOUDY water.  If my memory serves me right the old packaging was purple so these may be new manufacturers or new manufacturing and water that comes out does not taste good nor does it look safe to drink.

  Inserted the filter into my 6 months old Frigidaire, ran water through for 3 minutes as instructed, and waited for the cloudy, gray water to clear up. Still gray and cloudy.  ran it for 3 more minutes...still gray and cloudy. Tasted the water and noticed a slight sour aftertaste. I put my original filter (came with the new Frigidaire 6 months earlier) and the water came out clear and no aftertaste. I don't trust that this supposedly new filter came from Frigidaire or was new! It wasn't sealed and was loose in the flimsy box.  It is in the mail back to Amazon. I'm calling Fridgidaire direct.

  Normally, these filters work fine but I got TWO bad ones in the same order. When I inserted them and went through the purge routine, there were black bits of something that showed up in the initial water stream.  I ran the normal 10-15 pitchers of water to get rid of that ""baking soda"" aftertaste that is present with new filters. Even after the taste was OK, the water remained cloudy - Really unappealing. The photo shows tap water on the left and the ""filtered"" water on the right. Ugh!

  Have now bought 2 of these thru Amazon and both were absolutely horrible.  First one was bad and could barely get any water to flow, ice cubes were woefully small due to this lack of water and what did come out, even after flushing well over a gallon thru it, was milky/cloudy with a slight smell.  Have a whole home water filter and water everywhere else in the house is just fine so know it's not anything to do with the source water to the refrigerator.  Before calling Frigidaire or repair thinking there might be something wrong with the refrigerator itself, I suspected I got a defective one and bought another from Amazon.  To my amazement, the second was just as bad as the first.  So now almost 100.00 in filters simply gone.  So before I called Frigidaire,  I first opted to purchase a well known ""non oem"" filter cartridge and everything works fine so it's not the refrigerator.  I then purchased this same filter from our local home improvement store and surprise, that one works just fine!  Buyer beware!

  I ordered and installed this filter in October 2016. Everything seemed fine upon arrival and installation. Now it is Jan 6, 2017. My water has been starting to taste metallic, almost like a rust flavor in my water. I dumped all the ice thinking it was maybe freezer burnt ice. Still nasty tasting water. So I put in a new water filter, even though it hasn't been 6 months and my fridge was not telling me to change the filter yet. Presto! Good water again. So...this filter did not last for 6 mo. (with average water use) as it is suppose to as recommended by the manufacture.  I will be requesting a refund for my other 4 months of use I did not get from this filter. These things are to expensive to get barely half the use of them.

  My water was fine until I installed this filter. I have flushed gallons and gallons of water through it and the water is still cloudy. Not the full of air kind of cloudy that clears up if you let it sit, but dirty cloudy. Paid top dollar for the name brand filter and it does not work.  Note - if I let it sit to try to clear the water, it does not get clear, but there is a film of a chalky white substance left in the bottom of the glass or container.  By the time I installed it, it was too late to return, but this filter was faulty.  Money down the drain.

   Don’t waste your money and time on this garbage. I bought this filter 2 months ago, the water stream was cloudy and already slower than with previous filter, but over time this filter became slower and slower until this crawl. 2 minutes to fill a cup. Buy the filter directly from frigidaire’s web page instead, it’s cheaper there too when I bought it.I’ve contacted amazon customer support but he told me to bring it to a store and have it examined/fixed and if it’s faulty product then I “might” get my money back, since it’s more than a month ago I’ve purchased this. The whole point of buying things on the internet is to save some time and having to do so many things for a water filter is just silly. This filter wasted so much of our time & patience everyday already and we thought it might get better but got worse. The customer support isn’t helpful, the price is cheaper on frigidaire’s web page, the product is not working and will waste your precious time away, so there really isn’t any point in buying this filter here. It took my wife 15min to fill a 1L water jug every day... we have filmed it too, if this is not a faulty product then what? Made to malfunction?

  This is the only superglue with a container that doesn't glue me to itself or to myself!  I will never buy another Crazy Glue product because even if the product works, it doesn't matter if the containers suck.

  Update:  Seriously, it will glue your fingers to objects.  Be very careful where you point the applicator - just had an experience where the piece I was trying to glue on repeatedly stuck firmly to my fingers rather than the object I was gluing it to.I know from experience nail polish remover will get it off.  But actually it'd be nice if it had a little tint to it so I could make sure I hadn't accidentally spread it away from the surface to be adhered.Still five stars. :)*********I don't even bother with other kinds unless I need something with a rubbery consistency like barge cement.  Long story short - this product will firmly glue my fingers together which is actually a good thing, because it means that it sticks to just about anything.  Earlier this week I broke a wing off a heavy iron dragonfly ornament in the yard.  Sure enough, Gorilla glued it back on!  I had to prop it up for a while, and then later I used a little two part epoxy to prop up to spot on the bottom just because of where the break was located but it was amazing to me that a thin liquid glue would do such a good job on heavy iron.  You need very little of the product to make it stick, too.The container is superior as well - glue not dried up and useless after one use.Come to think I'll buy a couple more tubes just to make sure I don't run out!

  The glue does its job and I have had no issue with anything I glued with it, plastic to metal.  I always get gel super glue because it is so much easier to work with.  This was my first time using this brand and I found the consistency more runny than I am used to.  I will keep the bottle around until it is used up since it does work but I will not be purchasing again. The Loctite is a much thiner gel and the way it dispenses out of the bottle keeps you from using too much, I will go back to that glue.

  $5 to put my car back together?  Yes, please!A piece started to fall off my car for God knows what reason, and I just didn't feel like paying several hundred dollars to replace it.  So, I got some of this, cleaned the area inside and out, and glued back on the plastic, foam, and rubber parts of the piece to the car (it's a roughly 1-foot triangular piece beside the window on one of the doors).  I left it for 20 minutes, drove 15 minutes, then left it for almost 20 hours.  I haven't had any trouble with the piece again, and it was ready to fly off in traffic (!).  Unbelievable!  It looks like there was never a problem at all.  So, $5 to save hundreds?  Yes, please!I've since used this to glue wood, plastic, and tempered glass.  Flawless every time!  I also love the tip on this one—very easy to apply and keep from clogging.Do note that if you use excess, you might get a little bit of a cloud effect—I'm not sure what causes that, but it was obviously from excess.  Also, don't glue your fingernail to your finger like I did, haha.  Solving this required some creativity (all's well).  Very effective glue. :)

  This is a great glue.  The gel keeps it from getting everywhere.  Other super glues are very “watery” and run all over the place.  This glue goes down where you put it.  I generally apply it with a tooth pick.  The cap is awesome, with a little metal pin that keeps the nozzle from gluing shut.  Only issue is I don’t know that it contains the same amount of glue as the liquid forms of this glue.  But I won’t use anything but the gel form of this glue from now on.

  This is a quality set of lights overall: Packaged well, nice heavy cord, etc. The lights are a bit of a pain to install, in the sense that you must unscrew each bulb, hang the lights and then screw in each bulb. It's time consuming, but it serves the purpose of preventing bulbs from breaking as you are hanging the lights. As I stood on a ladder, having finally gotten the string of lights in the general place I wanted it, I dropped one of the bulbs and it shattered. That's on me. Thankfully the lights ship with one replacement bulb. Oh good, I thought, the manufacturers were thoughtful enough to prepare for this eventuality. I clean up the glass, replace the bulb, and carry on installing the lights. Then I go to plug them in. One light is dead already and another is flickering like it's about to give out. I tried screwing and unscrewing the bulbs, moving bulbs around to see if it was an issue of faulty wiring as opposed to bulbs, and no, it's the bulbs.UPDATE: It's been 2 weeks since I wrote the initial review and I have to drop another star. Two more bulbs seem to have burnt out in less than 10 hrs of total use.UPDATE 2: It's been about a week and a half since the last update. I received a very thoughtful email from the seller expressing regret about my negative experience with this product. They explained that sometimes in the manufacturing or in shipping, microscopic fissures can occur in the bulbs, allowing air to enter and causing them to burn out quickly. It seems I just got unlucky and received a particularly fragile set. They offered to send me replacement bulbs and fuses in order to fix the problem. I have updated my rating to reflect their good customer service. When I receive the bulbs and the situation is completely resolved, I will check in again.

  Looked wonderful. I purchased 2 boxes to decorate for a party I had, and 1 bulb from each box was blown, but since I didn't have time to return I used them with the 2 blown bulbs. The project was a hit, everyone loved the added touch.Update:  I've changed my review from 4 stars to 5.  The vendor reached out to me to see if my lights were received and if there were any issues.  I informed them that 2 bulbs were blown, and they sent 5 replacement bulbs within a week.  I'm very happy with my lights, and very satisfied with the customer services of the vendor.

  I have ordered 4 boxes of these light sets now, the 25ft. I might just get the longer strand at this point. I love love love these lights. I will attach a photo at a later date, but these lights are gorgeous. They arrived, I plugged them in while in the package to make sure they all worked. Then i unscrewed all the bulbs to make it easy to hang. I hung them up all around my balconey using a staple gun. When I finished I screwed the light bulbs all in :) I would highly recommend these lights. They are PINTEREST perfect!

  My wife read that before you hang lights, you take out the bulbs.  We have  hung 3 strings, over our deck and pergola, without any light problems.  All the 1 star reviews have had one or more light bulb blow out.  We have had none, and at this point, we are very happy with our purchase..

  Excelent product. Two key important things to keep in mind: Don't try to hang them before removing the bulbs, and don't connect more than three strands together. Highly recommend. Great product for an affordable price.

  Very nice set of lights for the price.  I bought a number of sets in various lengths to install on our deck and used a staple gun to mount them.  I am very pleased with how easy it was mount them neatly and also with the quality of light:  it's exactly the amount of warmth that we were looking for.  After reading the reviews, I also ordered a set of spare bulbs which came in handy as a few were broken upon arrival.  A year later we've had one bulb burn out, one socket disappear (more on that later), and a few bulbs get broken by people knocking into them.After the first year, one of the sockets simply disappeared.  It turns out that the sockets are not molded, but are clipped into a backing around the cord.  The socket has two prongs that pierce the power cord to power the socket.  I never did find the missing socked, so ordered a donor set to use as for parts.  There are two clips that need to be undone from inside the socket, and then the back comes loose.  You'll need a tiny flat blade screwdriver to remove it and can undo one at a time.  I was able to press the newly freed donor socket back into the original set and it is once again functional!  Way better than having a light out and way better than replacing the entire set.  My recommendation to anyone who has a bad socket is to press it firmly into the backing (against a hard surface), or remove it and check the contacts that should pierce the power cord.Bottom line: Yes these are cheap and yes these are fragile, but overall I'm quite pleased with how well the work, the quality of light they provide, and the fact that they're actually repairable.

  Beautiful lights! It's nice that the lights start right at the beginning of the string so there isn't a bunch of dead space between the plug and when the lights start, so you really are getting a full 25ft of lighted string. The downside to this is that if your plug is low to the ground then your lights also start at the plug, but I was able to just not put in the bulbs for the distance I didn't want lit and it works just fine.I had no issues with any of the bulbs not working but I did follow the instructions and carefully and gently removed all the bulbs before hanging the string and only then did I screw the bulbs back in. Since then, they have been very exposed to the elements for a couple months now with no obvious tarnishing or dimming or problems with lighting up.

  I use a lot of PPE. When I’m at work (Covid units), I’m in full, provided PPE/gear. When I’m in rotations, I’m mostly on my own for PPE, and that’s when I’m most at risk. So I’m picky about quality & coverage. I knew these were priced well above their competitors. At the time there were no reviews. I took the risk because in the photos it looked as though they provided a more snug fit around the face. Filtration is useless for me when I’m directly in a patient’s face and I’ve got gaps around the chin or sides. These do indeed fit snuggly (though not to the point of discomfort) around the face/bridge/chin. So far, the ear loops are comfortable. In terms of actual filtration, they appear to be maybe a slight step up from some of the less-expensive competitors, but I’m not sure a $50+ price difference is warranted. They still seem over-priced.A note about certifications: you will only find NIOSH certification on the N95s, not kN95s. In terms of the other masks on Amazon, FDA certification only means they are registered  and authorized to be sold in the US. It does not have to do with a regulatory quality or standards process they’ve undergone.Remember to keep all of the factors in mind. Masks do work, but the user also plays a role. Filtration is great, but you don’t want a ton of gaps. Avoid touching the filtered part of your mask. Only use the ear loops for on/off. And if you really want to have good technique, hand sanitize before donning/doffing. And don’t overuse a mask. This virus is heartbreaking to witness (truly), is no joke, and doesn’t just affect the elderly.

  I bought these masks as my wife and I headed out to San Diego during Thanksgiving week. I didn't want to chance using the thin blue masks for a long flight out to California and then back to the DC area. Comfort is about medium as the ear loops take their toll on your ears. I wish the seal was better as the mask itself will all of a sudden start leaking air from around your nose and cheeks. My wife's glasses were fogging up randomly even after adjusting the nose strip. I honestly did feel safer with the thickness of the mask. The size of the package was perfect for our trip. We had plenty to use on the plane ride there and back and while out and about. Other than the fact you need to relieve the pressure on your ears and adjust the nose strip to reseal the mask back to your face every 15-20 minutes or so, I’d say these masks are pretty good.

  This product falsely claims to have an FDA authorization; however, this mask is not listed on FDA’s site under “Personal Protective Equipment EUAs”. While there’s an image of an acknowledgment letter from FDA/CDRH stating that this request is under review, this is not the same thing as actually being authorized for that use. For that reason I’m giving this mask 1 star because it’s misleading to consumers and brings into question whether the mask is actually as effective as they claim or if it’s just another fake that seems to be prevalent in the protection mask sector right now.

  Google ""Chendge technology and CDC KN95"" the resulting pdf indicates that the filter material is appropriate and effective, but that no manufacturing certification has been supplied and the fit might be ineffective.  If you want to take a chance and try the fit out for yourself and assume that the filter material is consistent (without the certification), then these are probably good masks.  I specifically ordered them because I wanted ones on the CDC approved list and they weren't.

Nathaniel Newman, the customer service manager, sent a personal note to me, along with TWO replacement flashlights AND batteries.  Thanks so much for that, I’m knocked out.  These flashlights are compact, they fit right in your hand, and they widen the beam by extending the front part. It has different modes, including a strobe for self defense.

  bright, sturdy, and kool looking. Only complaints- did not come with rechargeable battery's, which for the record can be purchased and used separately.  Second, its immense power results in battery not lasting as long as my old light., IE it gets ""dull"", or noticeably not as bright. Battery run time for me is average one week, still emits enough light to see for most part, but I like it bright.I also use it everyday for at minimum 5 hours a day, so not really bad. Just thought good to point out. I'm very happy with this light and can see its quality will allow me to have it for years. Next investment is rechargeable battery to cut back on throw away. Tactical and cost effective. Also another great point about this product is on is on- full power. If you turn it off it goes back to bright. Not cycle through all modes unless you have it on and quickly depress the button to change it. My old light id have to cycle it which was VERY annoying

  I first ordered these lights a while ago and was immediately very impressed by their rugged design and EXTREME brightness unlike any other I had seen in their size.  I was a firefighter/EMT for over 19 years and have used many lights, but these are far and away the best I’ve ever used!  However, a few weeks later, I developed a problem with the switch performance and mentioned it in my review.  Without me even asking, GearLight’s Customer Servive promptly shipped me two new replacement lights as well as new switches for the ones I had.  They even sent new batteries as well!  This is way beyond being responsive customer service!!!  You cannot go wrong with these lights and this amazing company!  I have already bought another for a gift to my nephew and intend to give several more during the holidays.  I use mine several times every day.  It’s been quite a while since I wrote this review but now I’d like to add a few important comments.  I use one of my lights for something at least EVERY day and their size/light output ratio makes them so easy to keep in places where they will be handy if needed.  I’ve also had lots of first hand battery usage experience and they are amazingly good on batteries.  Best of all, I’ve found that they are backed by what in my opinion is the most reputable companies out there!  These really ARE THE ONES TO BUY!!!

  So I'm returning to EMS in little more than 2 weeks and got these two sun shine lights.  For now I'm using these lights as spotlights to illuminate my dog when he goes outside at night to do his business so I don't have to go very far into my backyard.  My dog does not like the invasion of his privacy, he thinks he can be sneaky and not have to do his business at night and get away with whining at all hours of the night wanting to go out and play.Well not with these sun grabbers.  So he has learned he's gotta go when I tell him to go.But this brings me to how awesome these will be when I go and try to light up a darkened night at a scene where I'm trying to find a wayward intoxicated victim or patient who doesn't want to be found.  There is no way that this light will allow that person to get away from me helping them out.  They might sign a refusal of care but at least I will get to assess them and provide the best care that insurance can buy.The SOS feature will come in handy when the violent patient decides that they didn't really want my help and knocks my rear end out and I awaken and realize that I need to flick the SOS feature on so my partner can find me in the pitch dark of the shoulder of the roadway.  Hopefully he has called the Air rescue to be able to see my SOS flashlight shining bright in the night and they can rappel down to my location to airlift me to safety.LONG LIVE GEAR LIGHT, Long Live GearLight.

  We only had our tv and cable boxes plugged in. I heard a noise like static to find this was catching on fire! I chose 1 stars for these only because I had to. I give it a fat zero and a fire hazard.

  I have about 6 of the old version of this extension cord/surge protector.The old version had several unbeatable features:--swivel head so you could have the cord angled in the right direction--flat head so you could put furniture against the outlet--long cord so you could use it behind a sofa and still have enough cord to plug things in.The new version is more than twice the width.  It's absolutely huge.  Not really flat at all.The new version has NO swivel head.  It's locked in the down position.  :(The new version is so thick at the head that's it awkward to plug in and almost impossible to plug in without touching the prongs as you push it into the socket which is incredibly dangerous.I thought perhaps I ordered the wrong brand but my old ones all have GE stamped on them, so they just made significant changes to make the product inferior.  :(

  For the first two months, we thought this was fine; the protected light was on, everything stayed in place, life was fine. But then we had a storm and the power turned off and back on fairly quickly, but both our gaming system and sound-bar that had been plugged in are no longer functioning. So much for ""protected."" We wanted this to be so helpful, but it couldn't even last through one storm!

  We bought this because we need that flat, square plug that's pictured with the cord going off of the bottom right corner. Instead, we got a round one with a cord going straight down making it useless because of other cords using the same outlet being the way. Really irritating that what's pictured is not at all what we got but is what's advertised. That photo needs to be changed or they need to figure out who screwed up in the ordering process.

   There is no locking mechanism on the product. “Twist to close” would be accurate but it no way do the covers lock into place. I would consider the covers then just a nuisance since it offers no protection and is so easily moved into undesired positions. Without an actual “twist to lock” feature this becomes an overpriced, annoying surge protector.

  I recently bought a bakers rack to go right outside my tiny kitchen, and by moving my microwave and Keurig to it, I freed up some much needed counter space.  But there's no outlet on that side of the narrow wall it's against, and while I could snake the rather short microwave cord back around to the kitchen outlet, my similarly short cord on the Keurig had nowhere to go.  So I figured another power strip was in order.  I didn't much care about surge protection, but this one caught my eye because the plug is flat, meaning I could plug it in behind the nearby loveseat and not risk crushing it against the wall.  The 10 foot cord was actually a bit more than I needed, and I knew that going in, but it means I was able to place it almost completely out of sight and have some cord length to spare.  It's pretty heavy duty and seems better made than the other power strips I've been using for years in different rooms.  Exactly what I needed, and at a great price.

  Works as described. Only issue is that it is somewhat difficult to get the plugs to go in all the way. It's not just one, but all of the outlets are this way on both of the units I purchased. Otherwise, exactly what I needed.

  I first measured out how long I needed the cord to be so that I wouldn't have extra cord laying around.  Then I use my wire-staple-gun to secure the cord to the wall neatly. And last I use double-sided-sticky-Velcro and I placed it on the back of the power adapter so that it would hold in place on the wall.Came out very clean!

  This might sound funny from a five star review, but it's true.  I'm sorry I bought this.Our carpet is 30+ years old.  We bought our home as a short sale, and there were plenty of upgrades needing to be done, so the carpet was the last thing on my list.  It's pinky-mauve, but if you close your eyes and just let your toes do the evaluating, it's really good carpet.Well, now I know differently.  I've had this carpet professionally cleaned several times - once before we moved in and about every 2 years after.  We've had a rescue dog and a rescue cat and two more rescue dogs - but no more ""messes"" than one would expect.  There are the days we don't get home for lunch, or don't get off work as early as we usually do... nothing major.  I always hand-cleaned any spots, and like I said, we do professional cleaning with well known companies.*gulp*The first night I had this light, I waited till full dark and turned it on.We're getting new flooring as soon as possible.

  I have bought it for detecting the surprises my cat left for me on the carpet. The description says it doesn't work well with cat urine. It worked for me,  so I gonna use it further.  Not sure about batteries life, but if you are not going to use everyday, it should last long.Pros:This UV flashlight is pretty small, solid and lightweight.3 AAA batteries are coming with it and it is ready to use as soon Amazon delivers it to you.You can easily find your pet's urine stains on the carpet even in daylight. (tested, see the pictures)You can check currency if it is not counterfeited or any other UV security marks on documents. (tested, see the picture)Cons:Be careful and don't aim to your eyes or your pet's eyes - this is dangerous. Also don't expose your skin with UV light as it may be harmful.

  I work at a veterinary clinic and perform anesthetic dental cleanings on pets. I use the light after I've scaled their teeth to see if there are any spots that were missed (some mouths are difficult to get in to). I photographed some teeth prior to scaling. Tartar and calculus appears highlighter orange, which my iphone was unable to capture how truly bright the coloring was. This is also great for using in the bathroom or floors/carpets to see what stains your pets may have left. I bleach the spot my cat pukes on, but apparently residue is still there according to the light - thanks light for telling me I need to get a carpet vacuum or something to get these unseen (but now seen) stains out. On a side note, I did enjoy that it came with 3 AAA batteries. I had another UV light purchased off Amazon that was not LED, but it had died after a 1.5-2 year time frame. This LED light if definitely much brighter for what I need it for. I will occasionally look at my own teeth to see if I've missed spots while brushing/flossing since I have braces.

  I am a tenant in an apartment building. I think it is safe to stop there but I won't. I argued with the management that there is no way this place was cleaned. They came in and inspected stating they saw nothing on the bathroom walls looking like pee...I took him in and pointed it out and then showed him everything under the black light. Let's just say I was not the only one with a churning stomach. This revealed streak marks from ceiling to floor where there had been a leak from the upper apartment in addition to the nasty yellow-tinted streaks on my wall.I am going to take this puppy EVERYWHERE for hotel stays and any future apartments. This little guy packs a punch and gets the job done.

  I didn’t rate this product on how well it works for deep cleaning because I did not buy it for cleaning purposes. I bought this black light for identifying uranium glass (it lights up or glows when a black light shines on it), and I love it’s size—perfect for keeping in my pocket or purse. The handle is nice, too.Nice clear instructions, love that it came with batteries. Very nice and bright light. Works perfect for what I use it for.Pictures of green glass that IS uranium glass attached, in case you’d like to see!

  didn't work to find cat pee. I suppose cat pee doesn't fluoresce as well as other organics, but I thought it would do better than it did. Actually I believe the problem is wavelength. This light is too much in the visible and doesn't have enough true UV to fluoresce the pee.Update: It was pointed out to me that the listing indicates that this flashlight will not work with cat pee so I shouldn't have been surprised when it didn't. I am increasing my review from 2 to 4 stars since the listing is accurate. I do suggest making it more clear in the title that it doesn't work well with cat pee because as it is currently written (""Pets Urine"") I thought it would work with cats. Really besides dogs and cats, what pets produce a pee problem? Changing the title to ""Dog Urine"" would be more clear. Anyways, other than that, it is a good product.

  I have runner rugs on carpet, have tried heavy duty Velcro and other things to keep them from sliding around.  Up until now nothing kept them in place for more than a few hours.  I've had this on there for about a week and it hasn't slipped at all.  It's not the easiest to cut through but it's worth it.  Make sure to lay your sticky side down on your rug or floor before pulling off the paper side.  I threw a few pieces away because it's so sticky, it curled up and stuck to itself.  I thank the reviewer who said it works for rugs on carpet.  May not have tried otherwise.

  I added some pictures of how I did it ( please check them out ) Some people put the tap on the rug bottom first. Because of the size of my project I sprayed my garage floor spot with a little all purpose cleaner, let it dry and they got to sticking the tape down. This is going to be my area rug for playing the bass guitar so I wanted it to stick pretty good. I did a bit of overkill but it’s working out just perfect. Once everything was lined up I put some funk music on and danced around, making sure every spot got stomped on. Nothing is slipping, this tape is the real deal. I easily give it all 5 stars ⭐️ for its ease in installing and working with. Let me know if my review has helped, okay? Thanks and be good to each other. (See pictures) ✌🏼😎🎸

  I was excited to receive this. The info said that it was safe to apply to the bottom of a rug and adhere the rug to carpet. So I applied it on Friday and on Saturday I decided to move the rug so I tried to pull it up. The rug came up fine. The tape however did not! I was working hard to get the tape off of my carpet..in my brand new house!! I thought I’d ruined my carpet with this tape. I would NEVER recommend this as a rug to carpet tape! Ever!!I was able to get it all up, but it was VERY difficult! And this was just after one day! I can’t imagine if I’d left it on longer.

  Best double-sided tape ever. I have used quite a few brands over the years with mixed results. This tape has the 2 most important qualities that you need in this type of tape. 1 - It sticks well and stays stuck. 2 - Easy to peel off the vinyl protective with a light slice of a razor knife. Hint: never try to peel protective from the end of the tape. A small slice about an inch in will get it done without blood loss.

  For the price, I suspected that this tape might be not so good, but I didn't really need great. SO, I paid the lower price than a lot of others, but I did NOT get lower quality! I'm amazed at the stickiness of this tape. It's thick and very durable. I used it on the edge of a beaded area rug, and this stuff even stuck to the thin 1/4"" bead on the edge! I also used this on an entry rug that was built for kids and trucks, very rough and grainy, but this stuff sticks to it like . . . well . . . like YYXLIFE TAPE! I would compare the stickiness to ANY other product out there. I have yet tried to remove any, so I can't remark to that.

   Updated to 5 stars* This is my new favorite thing but I am going to return it because of a noise it makes. Hopefully it's just this one because I would like another. *I was able to return it and they sent me a new one, I think I got that before they received the return, new one is perfect.* Things to note: the plug is in the front (at least if you are going to use the remote) I couldn't figure out why the remote wasn't working, I had the plug turned to the back but the remote needs to point at the infrared censor on the plug side.Pros: beautiful, so many options, you can mix 2 colors, you can do just stars, ocean waves, 2 kinds of fades, add music via Bluetooth, dimmable, automatically turns off after 4 hours, it's not just for kids but Parker of all ages who enjoy fun happy lightingCons: plug is in the front, placement doesn't really make sense, be careful when you are walking by, don't want a laser in the eyeDefinitely will make a great gift, get one for yourself too.

   The light moved and projected the waves clearly and isn’t loud at all, you can barely hear when it’s on which is great for falling asleep to! The component is a good size and all the settings / adjustments you can make are perfect and as specified in its description. The music function to Bluetooth works really well too, with a decent sounding system for a machine that’s not specifically made to be a speaker. Overall, it’s a great price for what it can do as a small compact star light projector.

  I ordered this because I was trying to find a night time sky night light that looked like stars / the northern lights.  In the pictures it kind of looks like that, but it really isn't.1. The package comes with a cord that ends in a USB port, but no way to plug it into the wall.  I had to grab my cell phone charger base in order to plug this in.2. There are not 10 colors.  There are 4.  They are trying to count two colors on at the same time as separate colors.  No.3. In the pictures it makes it looks like white starry lights are projected on the ceiling.  They are neon green dots that are in a grid pattern.  It makes a room look more like a techno dance club than a sleepy time bedroom.4. I was under the impression that it made wave sounds.  When it talks about wave speed it's talking about the lights, not a sound.  However you can Bluetooth it to your phone, you just have to keep your phone the entire time to have any sound coming from it.I will most likely keep this to give to one of my kids, but it was not what I was looking for at all.  Not a soothing night time aurora borealis starry sky white noise sleep machine.  It is better suited to a dance club.

  Love this purchase.  I wanted something that could create an ambiance for the home in a corner and this did the trick.  The colors pop and the star feature is so cool.  It does feel like you have the galaxy above you.  I am going to move it to my bedroom at some point and see how it works in there or buy one for the bedroom.The only draw back was the remote.  It wasn’t very easy to work in the beginning but when I figured out the settings and finally kept using it more often due to the keys being hard to push, it worked out just fine.Overall, great purchase for creating that ambiance setting that one would desire for their home.

  Works well for our daughter’s room as her night light but do wish it would stay on all night. Gives a unique look to the room Just be careful of using the red light with the motion, your neighbors may think the room is on fire. Light is bright but has intensity settings (low is still pretty bright). Build quality is average. Rotating motor is starting to make some noise after a month of use. Be aware of placement as remote for TV may change the light settings. Overall we are happy with it for our 3 year old but if I had to replace it I would look for a little better build quality.

  I bought this a year ago to have it on hand when my current PUR filter wore out. The old filter is losing its flow, so I tried to put this one in. It will not snap into place. I pushed very hard on it, and it simply will not snap in. To make sure I was doing it right, I put the old filter back in, and that one snapped right in, no problem. The new white filter looks the same as the old blue filter with some minor differences that were pointed out by other reviewers. It looks like those minor differences are keeping this filter from working properly.I called the Whirlpool help line, and after 15 minutes on hold I finally connected to a customer support agent, who talked me through the installation procedure. It was the same procedure I was already doing, so I was not doing it incorrectly before. The filter would not snap in. He thought that it might be the wrong filter, but I have triple checked everything. I have the correct filter model for my fridge.The service agent thought that there might be something wrong with this filter since I did not buy it from Whirlpool. He told me to order one from them and it will fit. I placed the order, but I have not received it yet, so I cannot report on whether or not a filter from Whirlpool (actually, Every Drop) will fit better than the one sold by Amazon. I will update this if/when I receive the new filter and try it out.BTW, the new filter cannot be returned to Whirlpool for a refund if I open the packaging. Without opening the packaging, I will not be able to tell if the new filter will snap in to place or not. So there really is no return policy.  I am gambling my own 50 bucks on their hunch that the same filter from Whirlpool will fit while this one will not.The bottom line on this is that this filter does not fit in the Maytag MSD2559XEM refrigerator. Caveat.UPDATE:I ordered a filter directly from Whirlpool as recommended by their help line. The cost was $49.99 plus sales tax. I received the filter in about a week.The packaging of both the Whirlpool filter and the Amazon filter are identical, and the part numbers on the packaging, EDR3RXD1, are identical. The filters themselves are NOT identical. When placed side by side, you can see that on the Amazon filter, the body of the filter flares out as it goes into the end cap. On the filter from Whirlpool, the body flares out only a tiny bit, and meets the end cap mostly at a 90 degree angle. Other than that, they look identical. But that small difference seems to be key. The old blue PUR filter also does not flare out where the body goes into the end cap.The first time I tried to put the Whirlpool filter into the fridge, it did not snap in. However, I gave it one more try and replaced the old one to see exactly how much force is needed to get it to snap in. Even with the old filter, I had to give it one last nudge in order to get it to snap in, so I tried that on the Whirlpool filter, and it worked. So, the Whirlpool filter DOES fit, and the Amazon filter DOES NOT fit. I did not try to remove the new filter to see if it will come out. That would be tempting fate a bit too much.The bottom line is that there are at least two versions of this filter out there. One fits and the other does not, even though they carry the same part number. Caveat Emptor when buying third party filters.I ran water through the filter until it stopped spitting air (about two gallons). The water smells and tastes OK. I cannot detect any of the off odors or tastes that other reviewers have reported. The flow is fine. It will take a while to see how long the filter lasts.I am leaving this rating at one star because I am reviewing the filter that I bought from Amazon, not the filter that I bought from Whirlpool. They claim to be the same filter, but they are not. Because of the misrepresentation of the Amazon filter, I would remove my one star and give it a zero if I could. Caveat Emptor.

  The Whirlpool EDR3RXD1 filter did NOT (work) filter water.  I bought filter from Amazon on 2020-04-04.  I install filter on Whirlpool ED5FHEXV502 fridge.  I run 4 gallons of water through filter to set filter into working mode.I set up three glasses of water (see photos). I let glasses of water sit on a table for 1 hour to come to room temperature. Then I used TDS Meter tool to measure the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) of water in PPM (Parts Per Million) units.Glass #1 contains filtered water from the fridge where Whirlpool EDR3RXD1 filter is installed; PPM reading of 255Glass #2 contains purified water from purified bottled water; PPM reading of 4Glass #3 contains un-filterd water from kitchen faucet; PPM reading of 256*** Result: Water from Whirlpool filter have *same reading as kitchen faucet water; meaning Whirlpool filter did *NOT filter the water

  UPDATED WITH CUT APART PICTURES OF EVERY DROP FILTER- still just charcoal in a sock ;)There are many recent poor reviews of this product since the changes made to the filter packaging in winter 2015.  Being a diligent Amazoner I listened and ordered the ""old"" 4396810 blue filter from another source that appeared to have back stock.  Well they sent me the new filters! So I gave it a try.The packaging mentions it is still a PUR licensed filter.  I popped it in, ran out a gallon.  The water was clear and taste like nothing-just how I like my water.I will update as appropriate for longevity.  I found the blue filters to be good for 3-4 months in the summer and 4-5 months in winter ( we drink mush more in the summer)I also opened up the blue filter to see what is so special that people yearned for, it's just a chunk of charcoal with a sock on it.  I'll open up the new white filter when it is spent.

  We purchased this filter from Amazon and followed all installation instructions for priming the filter, but the water tasted worse than before. Had a plastic taste that is not what we had with the previous filter. Not sure if we got a bad filter, but it was unacceptable and we contacted Amazon for a return. (filter manufacture stamp was 01/17)Update 09/23/17:We subsequently purchased a filter directly from the everydrop website as something was wrong with the Amazon filter. Upon installation we noticed a few differences. The amazon filter was difficult to install - the catch for the button would not engage without a lot of force. The everydrop filter installed much more easily. The second difference I noticed only upon opening the new filter. The everydrop filter felt lighter than I remembered the Amazon one feeling (before installation). The last difference was the everydrop filter had much more air to purge out than the Amazon one during the priming process.All the packaging looked the same between the filters without major inspection. I do not know if the filters are used or counterfeit - all I know is something is wrong with them. Purchasing directly from the manufacturer seems a safer bet in my mind.

  Filter had a leak that flooded our kitchen. There was manufacturing defect that was under the adhesive label wrapped around the filter. I saw a drop of water near the front of fridge after I changed the filter. Thought is was just a little that that I missed wiping up after the filter change. I have changed this filter every six months  since the refrigerator was new.Woke up the next morning to a flooded kitchen floor. The adhesive label had held the leak well enough for me to think there was no problem. Sometime during the night it let loose. I called the manufacturer and was told they don't warranty their products sold through 3rd party seller.  Thumbs down to Whirlpool. Now I have to check if everything I buy through Amazon voids the manufacturer warranty. And I get to repair a damaged floor.

  The picture I posted is the authentic product from Samsung website vs. the AMZN product shipped (and displayed).  I first noticed it was very light relative to prior filters I installed and then went to the Samsung website to see pictures of genuine products.  I noticed that the labels were identical except for the capacity section.  The authentic version shows gallons before liters, while what AMZN sent me reflected liters before gallons.I chatted with a Samsung customer service rep who eventually confirmed this was likely counterfeit.  The volume of counterfeit goods is mind-bending.  The health risks of using counterfeit filters is significant.  I thought paying full price would mitigate the risk, but based on the product I received, am going to return the item and buy directly from Samsung pending AMZN resolution.I spoke with AMZN customer service who were very helpful and indicated they would temporarily suspend this item pending an investigation (appropriately so in my view).  Be cautious folks.  Lots of money in counterfeit goods.

  First let me say this review is for the actual product and not Amazon. Their customer service, as usual, has been excellent.We have a 2010 Samsung refrigerator (model: RS263TDPN/XAA) and according to the manual and all on-line resources the replacement water filter is the DA29-00020B (aka the HAF-CIN/EXP).  For all these years we've owned this fridge we've bought our filter from Amazon and have never had an issue with the product.  So what does Samsung do, they go and change the design of the cartridge (ever so slightly) and now it doesn't work.The slightly redesigned filter no-longer works on my particular model fridge.  Let me just clarify one point, the filter does fit into the slot properly however the water DOES NOT FLOW.  I tried a dozen times installing it with and without the water turned off.  Every time the filter would screw in but no water.  Thinking perhaps it was a bad batch from Amazon, I even went to Home Depot and Best Buy and bought one from each of them but the issue was the same.I've spent several hours on the phone with both Samsung support and with J & J International (the company Samsung uses for ALL their parts).  Samsung support says it's not their problem because there is nothing wrong with the fridge itself. Since the issue is with the filter it's J & J's problem.  Well, J & J says they build the cartridges to match the specs given to them by Samsung so it is in fact their problem.  They also denied any changes to the design of the cartridge!  This back-and-forth was so ridiculous it was like something from an SNL skit!For those thinking ""what design changes"", or ""is he nuts, they look the same"" I'm attaching some photos showing the filter i purchased last year and the one from two weeks ago.So basically I'm not sure what to do!  I am still using the filter from last year (which is working like a champ still).  Was thinking about trying a third-party filter but not sure if that's wise.

  I have not used the water dispenser on my Fridge for a while. WHY, you ask. Because Samsung screwed the pooch and changed the design without checking to see how it impacted refrigerators already in homes. I have purchased a number of replacement filters from places like Home Depot and Lowes, and these are supposed to be good but they were not. Turns out the hole at the top of the filter was reduced in size by SAMSUNG causing them to impeded flow and fail to operate properly. The whole on the filter I just received is back to the proper size and now works properly YEAH!!!So I struggled to score this review because I think people with bad experiences will check low scores but I decided to score as things are today. I WANTED TO GIVE SAMSUNG 0 stars for hiding the truth of this situation and for deciding to sell through bad stock rather than recall and replace filters.

  Item received was not the SAME as advertised online on the Amazon!Product code appears to be the same but;1. Package DO NOT have the 'NSF/ANSI 53 Certified' Gold Mark as it appears on online page!2. Filter inside do not list 'Lead/Mercury' as listed online!Filter I received is Made in Mexico.It seems to me that ONLY the HAF-CIN/EXP filter batches made in Korea under 'Genuine Samsung' label carry the NSF/ANSI 53 gold certification, as those batches may have been actually tested and approved. Others just say 'confirmed to' notification.Those are available at local Lowes or Home Depot for ~$50+tax. I was ordering something else from Amazon and thought to add this as it appeared this to be the same but........it seems these are nothing short of those cheap knock offs available from others for around $10-20!If you want to make sure these confirms to NSF/ANSI 53, especially for Lead/Mercury, look for 'gold-certified' label and those genuine Samsung 'Made in Korea'Item is going out the door as a return.....Disappointed!!

  BEWARE!!!  2/10/2018 installed the filter according to directions.  Did turn water off.  Watched a You Tube.  It is not that hard.  After installed and turned water on little to no water was flowing from dispenser.  Worked with it for several hours.  Overnight water leaked on hardwood floor, went thru to lower level.  Immediately turned water off and set up heaters, dehumidifier and fans.  The big box store that we bought the refrigerator from sold the exact same filter 2/11/2018.  Again same results.  No water.  Monday after many conversations with SAMSUNG (customer no service) a ""TECH"" instructed to just remove the $49.00 filter.  YOU DON""T NEED IT!  Just install a filter on the water line.  Removed filter.  NO LEAK.  Water and ice maker are working fine.  The estimated DAMAGE to the hardwood floor is a mere $6,591.53. (SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS AND 53 CENTS)  The insurance company will be collecting the parts and SAMSUNG just might night like that.

  I like the long extendable pickup and overall sucking power. Not a big fan of the counter-top charge base (I would have preferred a wall mount).But after 3.5 years of light-duty use (under five minutes run time each week) my CHV1410L vacuum's battery died. Unfortunately the battery is NOT a user-replaceable item. That's a shame because the vacuum still looks new. And it would be wasteful to toss it in the trash just because Black & Decker didn't design this appliance so we could change the battery pack. For this reason the vacuum only gets 3 stars from me.Fortunately I have many years experience working on electronic equipment. I have rebuilt a few lithium battery packs too. So I decided to replace my vacuum's batteries. This is not a project for the average person, so skip this idea if you are not familiar with lithium battery safety.I disassembled the vacuum by removing six screws. Once inside I found that the battery pack can be removed by unplugging a connector. As luck would have it, the battery pack's plastic case is held together by two plastic tabs that snap apart. Inside the case are four (4) 18650 size lithium batteries and the cell charge protection circuit board.The rebuilding process was straight forward. I used four 18650 high current flat top cells (rated 20A continuous operation). These type of cells are found in some high capacity vaping devices. While soldering the cells it is critical to avoid overheating them. I used a temperature controlled iron, added flux, and worked fast to minimize the heat dwell time. The cells I used are these:

  Same issue as many other 1 star reviews. Some of the units' charger/battery seem to have major issues out of the gate. Mine lasted less than a week. After much arm twisting with the B&D rep, here is their official response after verifying the production date on my model:""We sell millions of these units per year and unfortunately, some did have charger issues.  We have rectified it and sending replacements to customers that had the issue.""Amazon -- you might want to make sure you're not sending out these defective units, and only those that have been ""rectified.""

  I have no idea how many B&D dustbusters we've thrown away in thirty years. My family never learns.Our latest (purchased November 2016) has a failing battery after less than a year and a half of light use. The charger is putting out the prescribed charge. The battery shows 15.3v. Turn it on and the whine gets rapidly lower pitched as it drops to 9 volts in 40 seconds and stops.Why are the reviews good? Is everyone just used to throwaway tools? It's not even like you could pop a new battery in. Junk.As a contractor who puts the date of purchase on every battery, I am here to tell you three to five years of constant use is what I'm getting from the quality batteries I buy. I won't mention brands because I think everyone knows what they are. Our next dustbuster is going to work with the18v lithium batteries I use in drills, impact drivers and circular saws.

  Had a SHARK which lasted almost three years before the battery gave out. Ordered a new Shark mid May and it wouldn't charge at all so it was returned. Bought this Black and Decker model and I charged it fully this AM and the charge lasted all of five minutes with continuous use. Thought perhaps it was completed charged so I tried again. Waited four hours until blue light stopped blinking and tried again. This time I got ten minutes of intermittent use before it completely died again so it's going back.All these companies need to find a new supplier for their lithium batteries especially since the buyer has no option even to replace it on her/his own.I wonder if Amazon reads any of these reviews or ever tests any of these products themselves.So batting zero for two, does anyone have a ""go to "" manufacturer that hasn't disappointed in the last couple of months?

  This is an excellent hand vacuum and I am on our second one.  But the reason I am on my second one is that the battery is not replaceable and dies after less than a year of regular use.  This is a major fault in design (or design on purpose?).  I would recommend another brand if you can find one with a replaceable battery.  There are videos online for how to remove and replace the battery with a suitable battery pack.  But this requires wiring and soldering skills.  It also dangerous if done wrong which could lead to a fire and voids the manufacturer's warranty.

  What I hate most about painting is the clean up. I usually get the sub $1 brushes at the hardware store because after I use them I basically toss them, I don't want to go through the hassle of cleaning them and those cheap brushes are usually ruined after you clean them anyways.So I have no experience with high end brushes, but I found these to be really good for the price. I actually bothered cleaning them a couple of time although for the price it's worth buying a new set for each painting project.They hold their bristles pretty well even after washing. Only had maybe 1 or 2 come loose during washing. Overall nice brushes for the price, especially when compared to the cheapos at the hardware store.

  I purchased these because we just bought a new house and new house means lots of painting! This is our third home we've owned so I have painted a lot over the years and have used a good variety of brushes. For the price, these are phenomenal!!They aren't perfect, a few bristles come out when you are washing and if you are edging out a whole room they tend to get a little goopy by the end. By that I mean, they accumulate paint on them and the paint dries a bit as you're going along so by the end of the room you need to use a little finesse to see that your edge is still clean and straight. Though, that said, you get 5 brushes!! So if you are finding it difficult to get a straight edge because of the brush getting full of paint, just grab a fresh brush.I find cleaning them easy. Whatever the bristles are made from cleans off easily with a small bit of soap and water. Aside from the few bristles coming out I have no real complaints. I have washed them all multiple times already and they are still in great shape. These will definitely suffice to get me through all my house painting and I believe they will hold up long beyond.I would absolutely purchase these again and I would also highly recommend them.

  If you are reading this, you are probably a cheapo too. I bought three sets of cheap paint brush sets off Amazon. Hint: the other two are on either side of this one on the Amazon lineup it compares it to. This one is the best of the lot because it has a decent amount of bristles and they are fine tipped so they don't leave too many brush marks. That being said, for big, critical jobs I go back to the Wooster and Purdy professional brushes, as manufacturing a top notch paint brush is an art. Even then, they don't make brushes like they used to.The problem with the other cheap sets is they skimp on the bristles, which are polyester (basically plastic). This really gets annoying if you are painting over an old wall where there are bare wood in conjunction with several layers of old paint. You will encounter a lot of tiny cracks and pinholes, or you have to slide paint under the edges of an old coat of paint. With high quality brushes, the high bristle count holds paint in reservoir, so if you have to fill in the imperfections, you just press harder on the brush and it milks the paint out to fill the holes, then you just go over it lightly the blend it in. These cheaper brush sets with low bristle count will run out of paint to do this, no matter how hard you press the brush down or bend the bristles. You are forced to dip it back into the can of paint. The more you do this, you lose time, and you have more chances of paint drops falling off the brush on your finish, etc.Another problem with the low brush count is it leaves visible paint strokes, so you have to go back over the area again with another coat of paint. In addition, the low bristle count won't hold paint as well, so you have more problems with paint dripping off the brush after you dip it in the can. Get a really good, high bristle count (preferably hog hair) brush with fine strand tips for feathering the finish so you won't leave brush marks, and you will know what I mean. But if you don't want to drop $35 for a single paint brush, then this cheap brush set will get you by.

  I bought this without reading any of the reviews because I just needed paintbrush cheap and quick, but after I ordered and was waiting for it to be delivered, I figured I may as well look at the reviews and what I saw made me regret buying it. One person said basically that all it did was shed and was was good for nothing but a single use, so imagine my surprise when it came and I was using it, washing it after, waiting for it to he shed and nothing happened. It's a great brush for the price and in general I would say to a certain extent. The only issue I have is that the handle is very light, which makes it feel cheap, but it is, so...

  What a horrible disappointment.  These brushes shedded bristles as i painted and in the end I used them once and threw them out as I went.  When I tried to wash them the bristles just went in all directions.  They were completely not pro grade, more like 99cent store grade

  This painting is far from complete but the background was done completely with the 1"" brush using acrylics (and some of the detail I did with a 1"" flat brush not part of this order), but I also used the 2 1/2"" brush to repaint outside wooden plant shelving with house paint and neither brush shed any bristles and both were easy to clean and bristles remained soft. I'd take a picture of the shelving too but it's 104° outside right now ugh.

  This string is worthless, you will go through it like crazy. I have a normal sized in town yard and used an entire roll on two charges doing the yard once.

  Product received was not Black and Decker.  Since it was to be my first time replacing the spool after initial purchase last year, I thought I'd go with the brand-name replacements.  These do fit in my trimmer, and I've run the trimmer for a few minutes and so far so good.  We'll see.  However, when I see a picture online that is clearly a Black and Decker product, and the first words in the product title are ""Black and Decker""  and there is nothing in the description indicating that it is a generic product intended to be a substitute for the brand-name -- I actually expect to receive a Black and Decker labeled product.

  I bought this in the past but it does not seem to be the same quality as before. Don't waste your money on this. When I used it wouldn't last for more than 10 seconds and would break off, even when using the lower speeds. Each time the line broke it was inside the trimmer head, so I had to remove the head every time and put it through the hole. Seems defective since it is breaking when it doesn't even strike anything.

  Quick and simple replacement in my refrigerator. Things to note:1. The instructions say to 'prime' it by running at least 1.5G thru it to clear any items from the water. I found this way too minimal a quantity. I ran at least 3.5G to get rid of what I could very easily see in the water.2. You'll hear some weird noises during that 'prime' time, almost like air or straining. It's ok, it ends.3. Water tastes great. Most simple water filter replacement that I've had yet.

  Initially ordered this product in 2016, and it worked fine. Ordered again it to replace the old filter for regular maintenance. Water was cloudy even after several gallons dispensed. Exchanged for replacement, thinking it might have been a fluke. Water was still cloudy even after several gallons dispensed. Requested another exchange to give the seller the benefit of the doubt, but was charged a restocking fee of $11.96.So instead, I ordered the Frigidaire ULTRAWF Refrigerator Water Filter Sold by: Amazon.com LLC, which supposedly works for most french-door Frigidaire models.

  Recently purchased, i don't know how long this unit will last but I thought I could clear up some confusion on these.  Unit has to be purged after installing otherwise you will get this very nasty taste for gallons and gallons of water.  I ran about a half gallon of water through the dispenser, pulled the filter, and shook all the water out in the sink.  Repeated two more times, except dispensed about a quart out before pulling.  Bad taste gone.I found this out by googling service websites, where i found that Frigidaire makes a bypass valve for these filters.  So if you don't really need the filter, just want the water flow, contact Frigidare @ 706-860-4110 and order part # 242294502.  $34, free ship.  You won't find that part number on their website btw, or that telephone number.  Took a bit of searching and listening to mood music for hours while i was on hold ...but worth the wait. ;  )

We cleaned the roof overhang (made of vinyl) with alcohol, per the instructions, we installed the clips and let them sit before installing the lights (per the instructions), we pushed the clips firmly into place (so much so, I had a bruise on my hand), we put the clips 1 foot apart from each other (instructions say to put the clips no further than 2 feet apart), we then hung up our lights.

The clips actually were clear but unfortunately, the actual strip that holds the clip is white so it defeated the whole purpose of being clear, with the big ugly white strip holding it up.  I would not recommend these and I won’t purchase them again.

  AWFUL.its such a weird thing to be excited about command clips. I bought these to put up lights on my patio and after I had all of them up my brand new lights came crashing down and a bunch of them broke. maybe it's my fault for expecting them to stick but they didn't. not only am I out the $20 I spent on the lights but now I'm out another $10 for these that don't WORK.super disappointed.

  GOODS: The price is very low. They seem to be the same as the 3M plastic. It included 24 adhesive strips.BADS: Nothing so far; the parts I have used are sticking as well as the more expensive hardware store packaging.COMMENTS: By all appearances and simple pull testing these are 3M clips. Yes I can pull them off but they take the same force as the other 3M clips I have.  One note on Command adhesive. They will pull paint off of wood or dry wall if left on for over a year. Also, the adhesive pull tab will often break off before releasing the part if they have been in place for over a year.  That is a 3M issue not a sellers.

  I bought these clips to hang my Christmas lights around my windows (inside). They work extremely well and being clear, they are almost invisible from the outside. I used some smaller clips mainly on the sides of the windows to keep the lights where I want them, but these heavier clips are holding the weight of the lights (mini LEDs). I think they would easily hold heavier lights than I am using. I am happy with their performance and will use them again!

  I used these to hang my string lights on my metal Pergola.  They worked great so far.  They have been up a couple of weeks without incident.  I thought my lights would be on the ground the next day from the heaviness.  But, they are still hanging even in a couple of rain showers.  The command strips are in direct sunlight all day and are continuing to hold.  Will see how long they last, but for right now.  I have no complaints.  Oh, they do report various other materials the command strips would work on, but wood is not one.  I attempted to hang some string lights on my wooden arbor as well, but that didn’t work.  I just had to wrap other smaller lights around and let them hang.

  I purchased these clips to hold up solar patio light strings on my back porch. I saw fairly mixed reviews on this product but they have worked perfectly for me. They've been stuck up on my porch for over a month and have experienced some 90+ degree weather and are all still holding strong. I will say that the clips are under a covered porch so they aren't subjected to direct rain. Also, I made sure to wipe any area I wanted to stick one with rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt. I'm happy with this product.

  NOTHING said about this product is true. It does NOT vacuum debris from the floor, it just gums it up on the pad. It is the absolute WORST floor cleaning system ever designed. The pads are expensive, awkward and completely ineffective. They last for maybe a 2' square cleanup, then need to be replaced. They do NOT absorb messes. They smear the mess (plus the sticky solution) all around, so the mess is now spread all over the floor as a grey, visible film. It's also infuriating that the product is not returnable.

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Tool Daily Foam Cannon with 1/4 Inch Quick Connector, 1 Liter, 5 Pressure Washer Nozzle Tips",$20.49,5.0,"
  I noticed that most reviews here are just for the power washer nozzles.  As most know, Amazon often mixes product reviews.  I ordered the foam cannon and the nozzles came as a bonus.  BTW, they are the same quality as the nozzles that came with my pressure washer. It' almost seems like they all are the same as if they are made by the same manufacturer. They're high quality.  I see someone mentioned that they wear out. I can't imagine how power washer nozzles can wear out and I've been using the ones that came with my pressure washer for years with absolutely no problems.  Brass and aluminum is not worn out by soapy water or plain water. The only thing I can think of is that person was experiencing a buildup of minerals from hard water.  If that's the case, that's easily cleaned out using LimeAway or any similar product or even just vinegar.Anyway, enough of that.  It's the foam cannon that I ordered this combination for.  I put a few tablespoons of Chemical Guys CWS_110 Honeydew Snow Foam in the jar and filled it about 2/3rds the way with water.  I turned it on and holy smoke!  The thickest foam covered everything I tried it on. It was like icing a cake. Beautiful thick foam!  I immediately thought that this is one tool that I'm going to wonder how I ever got along without in the past.  This is going to be great not just for my truck, SUV and motorcyle, but also for windows, etc.  When testing it, I used it on our big gas grill.  It worked beautifully.Before ordering this, I read many reviews as I always do when buying something. Like the nozzles, I can't figure how the foam cannon didn't work for some people. The only thing I can think of in this case is they used the wrong foaming product or they didn't adjust it right.  When I first turned it on, the blast was very strong and narrow.  It really blasted the foam on in a tight stream but it spread out easily and quickly.  Then a turn of the adjustment and I could get anything from a wide, gentle fan of foam to the concentrated, narrow blast.The way these work is very simple and basic. It just applies the venturi principle. There's very little that can go wrong with the cannon itself.  BTW, you can tell this foam cannon is high-quality when you pick it up.  Other than the jar, it's almost all solid brass.  I doubt if there's any practical difference between this and higher priced foam cannons. In fact, I'd be suprised if they all aren't virtually identical for all practical purposes so why spend more.  The old adage that you get what you pay for is nonsense. If it was true, there would be no reason to shop around and compare prices.  That rusty old adage would mean that you would get a better car if you paid more at one dealership for the same exact car than you paid at another dealership. Nonsense!  An example from last week: I'm changing the transfer case oil in my truck.  Most dealers online charge $49.95 to $59.99 per quart!!!!  I went to the most popular online auto parts store and I got the same exact stuff for $5.35 per quart.  My point is, just because someone else charges more for a foam cannon doesn't mean it's better.  This one is a great value, especially considering I now have a spare set of nozzles for my power washer.Just buy it!

  This foam cannon looks just like the more expensive products.  No instructions but hey, can you put liquid in a bottle and turn a knob?  This thing makes foam, lots of it.  Very impressive.  I wet my vehicle, foam it and use a terrycloth mitt.  Makes for an easy wash.  I usually mix the soap with water, 50/50,  and seems to work better than pure soap.  The included spray tips are a bonus and work as well as OEM.  If I ran over it tomorrow, I would call it a successful run and buy a new one.  But it looks like it will hold up as long as I will.  Nothing to wear out but me.

  Product is exactly as described and seems to be a lot cheaper than some of the name brands. The brass fittings seem to be durable but I will update the review if that proves false. No leaks. Would buy again.NOTE: You will *most likely* need to purchase a Quick Connect M22 to 1/4 Male Coupler Adapter, the quick connect side fits the spray cannon and thew 1/4 Male end seems to be a fairly universal fitment for the pressure washer end. I purchased this one here and it works great with this product.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CRTJDNQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

  For what other foam guns cost, and the rated pressure/GPM, this thing produced a lot of foam.Its not like a bubble bath fluffy amount. But it is a thick coating of foam. After you figure out where to set the 2 knobs, youll be foaming up car boats and whatever else 2 consenting adults wanna foam up. It required less time and car wash soap to do 2 cars than I had been using to do one. The bottle is heavy gauge plastic. But I wouldnt recommend playing catch with it. Plus I got 5 tips for the pressure washer.

  I was very concerned when I first bought this product because it was so cheap. I decided I would take a chance and if it didn't work then I would just return it. Well turns out this product is great! It is very well built and heavy so you know it will last. The suds this cannon makes are perfect as well. There is no reason to pay $40 for the other cannons when this one works just as good. The only thing I recommend is to buy the better soap. Chemical Guys does make the best soap and when I first used this product that is the soap I used. My car is spotless and the whole process only took about 30 minutes from start to finish. Do not waste your money on more expensive cannons!

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Regalo Easy Step 38.5-Inch Extra Wide Walk Thru Baby Gate, White Original version",$39.99,4.0,"
   Purchased back in September of 2015 to keep our newly adopted pup from our furniture (we weren't sure at the time if she would tear up through our furniture if we left her alone).  The gate did its job just fine.  But then again, we have a 25-lb Chihuahua mix, so we didn't need a massively sturdy gate to keep her at bay.  Now, we did take care of my friend's 40-lb Shepherd mix who had some major issues with thunder.  He would get pretty panicky during a storm and constantly jumped and leaned on the gate.  I'm happy to say that he never toppled the gate over.  He did manage to jump over the gate some how.  Don't know exactly how, me must have used some secret Parkour skills or something to get over it.  So, as far as sturdiness goes, it passes by my standards.As it relates to durability, I see no issues.  Of course, we don't have kids pull on the bars and bang on the gate, so I just may have not seen any of the issues just yet.  If I do, I'll likely update this review.As far as operation goes, I like the old version better.  The old version was probably a tid bit easier to open with one hand.  Now I read a few complaints that this gate requires two hands to open.  That's not true, just look at my video.  It's possible to open with one hand and really isn't that hard.  May take a bit to get used to, but not impossible like some reviews make it seem to be.  The major downside I see in the operation of this gate is that it only opens in one direction.  The old version of the gate opened both ways, which was really convenient.  That said, make sure you have the gate opening in the direction you want.  Don't want to second guess yourself in the middle of installation because its a pain to loosen everything up and flip it around.Setting up the gate wasn't hard, but it wasn't super easy either.  You have got to screw those side bars out pretty far to close the gap between the gate latch and the post.  And the farther it goes, the harder it is to turn, so get ready to put some elbow grease into it.  Once you have the gap small enough so that the gate can lock in place and stay secure, its pretty much guaranteed to be rock solid.  One recommendation:  buy and use the ""Wall Savers for Pressure Gates"" if you can (the pressure mounts puts some massive point pressure on your walls).  If you don't, you could damage your wall.  In my case, my opening was too narrow to fit the wall savers, so I had the pressure mounts pushing directly against the wall.  It didn't damage my wall, but it did peel off the paint.  In an effort to prevent this from happening again, I cut piece off of a Kleenex box and put it between the pressure mount and wall.In conclusion, as my headline says, this gate does its job, at least for me.  As I mentioned earlier, the real major negative on it is that it only opens in one direction.  Now if you have 70lb and over dogs to keep at bay, not sure if it'll be able to handle.  My take is that it should, it would just take some major tightening of the pressure mounts.

  This gate is well made and a good gate. I have only one comment. IF your doorway is 33 1/2"" you will NOT be able to use this gate. Without the extension the gaps on the side are too large, with the extension the bars are 1/2"" too wide to go in the doorway and believe me I tried.  I have an old house and the wood is hard and the bars don't give. And before anyone mentions the gate having give I know that, that was not the problem, I had it pulled in as tight as it would go. The smallest doorway  the gate will fit WITH the 6: extension would be 34"" and you would not be able to use the additional ""cups"" with that width.  Just my two cents worth.

  I see a lot of people complain that it came bent or that the latch doesn't fit to the door. Well if you would take the time to read, you would see that it is meant to be that way. So when you returned it and then had the same issue... Well because its made to be like that. You obviously didn't read. It is bright orange and hangs right by what everyone is claiming to be defective!!! Just read people. Here I posted a photo of what you neglected to read!!!I bought three of these gates and they worked perfect for the space I needed them for. Though if the space was getting to big then it didn't seem as strong. But if trying to gate a smaller space this is great!!! Like I said I bought three and they are wonderful! Just try to use for the smaller allowed setting and it will be great. If you go for the larger end of the settings it make be a but flimsy.But again!!!! The door is supposed to be slanted before installation!!! Read the instructions people!!! I mean for come on how did you miss the bright orange paper that hangs from the gate? It says it is not a defect right there!I will get again if I need for other spaces.The gate when open is a bit narrow but nothing that is a problem for me. But if I could recommend anything I would say make the gate open a bit wider. But someone else posted picture with person trying to walk through so have a look.

  We have a two stories house, and we used to allow our dogs to go upstairs anytime they want. We have carpet upstairs and wood floor down stairs, and sometimes one of our dogs will go upstairs at night when everyone is asleep and have an accident (pee or poo). So we decided to buy a pet gate, so we can stop them from going upstairs at night. At least if they have accident downstairs it's easier to clean up because of the wood floor. The gate works very well, it’s very easy to install and to operate. Only issue I have with it is, when we walk across the gate, the bar (see picture) at the bottom kind of requires extra attention, I almost got myself tripped a few times. And we have two elder people in the house, so that keeps me worried. But other than that, the gate works great.

  For the reviewers who claim this gate is cheap or defective, you are wrong. Take a moment and read the instructions. Out of the box it appear to be ""warped"" as others have referred it it - but it is actually designed that way on purpose...so that you can tighten it and create the proper amount of tension. I had it assembled and working in less than 10 minutes. It is durable, strong and fits my door opening perfectly. I have two five month old golden retrievers who destroyed the two wooden gate we had before I found this one. They can't chew through this gate nor are they able to knock it down through brut force! I am 100% satisfied.

  We have two of these now, and they work great.  They're easy to set up.  They have a slight learning curve on opening them one-handed, but it's not bad.However, on neither of our gates did we choose to use the wall cups.  Oil or moisture has since leeched out of the rubber feet onto our wall, permanently staining them.  We have planning on painting this foyer anyways, but just be aware of this if you're purchasing the product.

  An introductory fact: I suffer from irritable bowel disease, and one of the most common symptoms that occurs in my case is hemorrhoids. Thrombosed, clustered, life-altering hemorrhoids. The kind that require surgeries, a preposterous fiber intake, and weeks of being bedridden because it hurts too much to stand.My most recent flare was awful. I missed an entire week of work, two weeks after being initially hired. I needed to heal, and quick.So of course, I followed my fiber and laxative regimen, applied the proper ointments, took sitz baths thrice daily, and visited my doctor and surgeons. And then, it occurred to me: the Squatty Potty!!!I'd heard tales of its splendor from fellow IBD and IBS sufferers for years, but for some reason, never thought that it could help me. But here I was, a new job at risk, and I knew that it was time to, at the very least, give it a go.I was a fool to wait until now!This little stool has revolutionized my bathroom habits. As somebody who has been heavily restrained by time, who has lost countless hours toiling to no avail on the porcelain throne, this tool has proven invaluable.It is comfortable! My body feels RIGHT when I use this stool to pass my stool. No cramping, no unnecessary pushing, none of my usual struggles.It is effective! I had previously been utilizing a little box as a makeshift Squatty Potty; I don't know exactly what it is about the actual thing in comparison to other stools/ the box I was using, but it is definitely designed precisely for bowel relief. The slant, the height, everything.It is affordable! This small price is nothing in comparison to the money I will likely spend in the future on hemorrhoid treatment. Will it cure my IBD? Of course not, but it DOES make it easier to live with, and that in itself is worth so much to me.My hemorrhoids will likely continue to make their occasional appearances, but this little stool has helped an incredible amount in reducing my suffering from said visitors.If you suffer from such ailments and are on the fence about shelling out for this little tool, let me be your voice of reason:Buy the Squatty Potty. Your rectum will thank you.

  If your pressure washer completely stopped working, read this!I had bought this pressure washer just over 2 years ago for one job lasting about 4 hours total. At the time, I put the unit away and forgot about it for 2 years until I needed it this summer. When I took it out and fired it up, the pump ran for about 5 seconds then ""died."" I tried for days to get it to work with no luck. I was one week over the 2 year warranty, so I was pretty ticked off I was stuck with this hunk of junk.Then talking with a guy at work he mentioned you're supposed to use a pump protector lubricant after each time you use the pressure washer. I read up on this a bit, and the leftover water in the unit can cause the pumps internal gaskets to seize up. This might be due to the minerals in the water, I don't really know. I was considering buying a different unit, then thought I'd take a shot at using the pump protector liquid on my ""dead"" pressure washer.At Wall Mart I bought ""Powerfit 3oz Power Washer Pump Protector"" in the tools isle. This $5 liquid brought my pump and pressure washer right back to life!! You actually screw the plastic threads on the bottle into the threaded garden hose inlet on the pressure washer. Then just squeeze the bottle a bit. I didn't realize if I was doing it right because I couldn't tell if the liquid was actually going in. About 10 minutes later I connected the hose and the unit worked.Hope this helps some people!Update 5-21-18 - Another easy fix for dead unit :)------------------------------------------------------------------------This week I had an issue with the pump not starting, that the power wash pump protector liquid trick didn't fix. I tried different outlets thinking it was an electrical issue. It turned out to be an electrical issue within the GFCI plug of the power washer unit (likely from me leaving it outside in the rain a few days last year.) With the unit unplugged, take a phillips screwdriver and take the cover off of the unit's GFCI plug. With the cover popped off, if you see lots of moisture that's been trapped in the plug, that will prevent it from running.I bought a replacement plug at my local hardware store. You can find the same replacement plug I used successfully to fix my pressure washer by typing this into the Amazon search bar: ""Leviton 16693 15-Amp, 120-Volt, Grounded, Compact Automatic Reset Right Angle GFCI""It's about a 5 minute job.. Just reconnect the wires to the new GFCI plug (Black wire to gold connector, white to silver) and turn the screws to secure the wires in place. Screw down the ""U"" shaped stress clamps that come with the new plug, they hold the wire in tightly. Then attach the new cover, and you're good to go.Update 7-20-20 - Maintenance on quick connect spray nozzles------------------------------------------------------------------------5 years later my Sun Joe washer is still going strong. After your pressure washer has been around a few seasons, it's possible that the very fine holes in the quick connect spray nozzles will get some corrosion. Any little corrosion can affect the amount of water that can pass through, and I found will often prevent the pump from running and shut the pump off. If your pump turns on and runs with no spray nozzle attached to the wand, but does not work with the nozzle attached that's a clear sign you need to do some maintenance on your nozzles to reopen the holes in the nozzle.What I did was take a bowl and fill it with Vinegar. I just used vinegar because I had it in the house, there may be other good methods to get rid of the corrosion. I soaked all the nozzles in the bowl for about 3 hours. Then I took a sewing needle and poked around the hole to clear out any corrosion. Soaked them for a couple more hours, and then rinsed them off under some hot water. Then I dried them off and sprayed each nozzle with little olive oil cooking spray to help prevent any more corrosion before storing them. There are lots of corrosion inhibitors on the market I just used something I had around. This method worked well as it opened 3 plugged nozzles for me.

  Total junk!  Unit quit working a couple days after return period expired!  Do not recommend at all!!!!  Compound this with the fact I'm now stuck with a pressure washer and have heard nothing from Snow Joe LLC.  Buy locally at Home Depot or Lowes - at least you'll have a normal return period, have support right there in your own home town, and not be left high/dry by Amazon thousands of miles away.

  Ever since I was a little boy, going back to my first purchase, probably something like a cap gun for a dollar at my local grocery store, I've had experiences; great, good, bad, etc. with products.  In my forty years of purchasing things, I have never been so confused, aggravated, annoyed, and downright flummoxed by a product as I have been with this pressure washer.I purchased, via Amazon, almost two years ago.  I followed the directions on assembly.  I have assembled things before.  I think I am not a moron, and yet, it did not work.  It did not turn on.  So, I read the troubleshooting guide.  When a product has a lengthy troubleshooting guide, walk away.  I tried a new plug, a different extension cord, reset the GFCI, uttered spiritual incantations, and then, miraculously, it turned on!  Then it shut back off.  That was the summer of 2018.  I never used it.  It never worked.Then summer of 2019 dawned.  The world was introduced to Forky.  ""Old Town Road"" topped the charts. And me and Joe decided to square off again.  I was ready to battle, but unfortunately, he wasn't up to the challenge.  Turn on, kick off, never come back on.  At one point in the summer, he did spray for 10 seconds, and by the time I walked over to the house to begin, glorious, he had returned to hibernation.Here we are.  2020.  COVID.  Time to clean the virus off the shingles.  I cleaned the filter.  I bought a new hose. I checked multiple faucets.  Same. Result.  I have given up.  I am reminded of that cap gun I bought when I was five.  Sure, it broke almost immediately, but at least it gave me a little bit of joy.  When I order a pizza and it is wrong, at least I can still eat it.  Joe, you broke my heart.

  Plastic handle doesn't feel like it'll hold against the excessively thick and rigid cup. I needed to clear the shower drain and had to step on the cup with considerable strength before the cup would cave. No amount of pushing down on the flimsy handle alone would push the cup alone. This is a fairly attractive set with no functional value.

  My experience was that this is actually a good plunger.  I was concerned with some of the reviews that said the suction wasn't good.  I'd take that into consideration, but I liked the look of it and the stand it comes with, so I took the chance and thought, it's a plunger, how bad can it be?  I bought it for frequent clogs in an upstairs bathroom.  Used it this morning.  My opinion is that it's very well made and very sturdy.  As I actually used it, I found that at first when pushing down, the rubber cup is so sturdy, that you have to put a little extra strength in pushing the handle down to create the suction.  It worked just fine, the suction was great, it did the job.  The handle is sleek and smooth, so I had to use the end of my palm to get a better grip and push it down hard from the top since the rubber cup is so sturdy.  It would be helpful if the handle had some grooves or something to aid with grip at the top of the handle.  So I like it, I'll keep it, and I'd buy it again for a second bathroom.

  It's nice having both a plunger and a cleaning brush all in one. I haven't had to use the plunger so I don't know how easy it is to use yet. The toilet brush cleaner is nice though. I will say it because it is white and I have pets in my house sometimes it looks dirty because of the fur sticking to it, so it does require a quick wipe down now and then. Other than that though it is a fantastic purchase.

  I purchased this last minute for a camping trip and wasn't expecting much for the price, but overall it surpassed my expectation. The fan only lasted two and a half nights (about 20 hours) on the high setting, but it lasted longer than the description said it would. The light was nice and bright and lit up my whole tent. On the low setting, the fan only created a faint breeze, but on the high setting I could feel the air on my face from 6-7 feet away. Having two hinges made it easy to point the fan and light in separate directions and overall I was happier with it than I thought I'd be.

  I had high hopes for this product and while it works as described, it doesn't have the durability I had hoped for. The led is bright enough to light up a large tent. The light is diffused well and lit up our 8 person tent with ease. The fan provides a decent subtle stream of air and is quiet enough that it won't keep you awake. The end with the fan/led ring is adjustable so you can aim it where you want. The batteries lasted over a week of on/off day and all night use. The light/fan use the same power supply (the batteries) and as a result the light dims a slight amount and the fan slightly slows if you use them at the same time. My reason for 3 stars is the plastic the frame is made of is brittle and weak. We had packed it with our other camping supplies and the plastic end caps came out along some of the plastic chipping. It still functions fine, just wish it was made with more robust materials. If it was produced with higher quality materials this would be a 5 star product for sure. I would still recommend this for those looking for a tent fan/light but would take it easy on it and protect it while in storage.

I had it on high every night and it really makes a difference. I have a 3 person tent. It takes 6 D batteries and I used it all night for 4 nights and accidentally had it on the whole 3 hours home in my bag and the batteries are still working. I didn't use the light very long.

  I opened the box. I put in new batteries.  The light wont turn on. The fan works... so that's nice when its 28 degrees outside and you just want to go to sleep. Thankfully I live by ""Two is one and one is none"" so my Streamlight Stinger swooped in to save the day. Do not buy, cheaply made, flimsy and will fail you when you need it the most.  A regular lantern or even a regular flash light aimed at the top of the tent is worth the extra money when you NEED to have light.

  The top mask in the photo is the mask I am reviewing, the bottom mask is a standard adult size mask for size comparison. I bought these masks because adult masks are too big on my face, a problem that many of my other female friends have encountered. These masks worked fine. This is a good mask to wear running in and out of stores or for shorter periods of time because the fit is much closer to the nose and mouth than adult size masks. The nose adjustment works, the ear straps are stretchy and comfortable.  Colors are cute and cheery (also have pink, yellow and green).

  These are okay masks for school children - a bit too big for younger kids (longish and so they 'ride up' or 'ride down' on little faces), but are good for grade school kids (7-10 year olds, depending on their face size)? The comfort is fine once the fit is right. The main issue I have is with the packaging - they arrived in a thin cardboard box  WITHOUT ANY plastic covering or bag for the masks in the box - basically just stuffed as is inside the thin, unsealed, folded cardboard box. Given all the hands and places the box passed from production to delivery, I'd think that at a MINIMUM the masks would be packed in some form of covering (a basic plastic bag for the whole stack?) inside the box. I discarded a couple of the top and bottom masks because it felt to me that there was no way they were still clean. And ... I placed the rest inside a disinfected zip bag and tossed the god-knows-where-this-was-box.

  Fit the 4 year old, 7 year old and me (adult, narrow face width). Cute colors made the kids excited to wear them. Each mask has a wire nose strip to fit better to the child’s face. Comfortable ear straps. Mask became a little loose on the 4 year old after they pulled it a few times so we just twisted the ear loop once or twice to tighten it back up. Good value for obey.

  I slipped in the shower the other day, and grabbed my towel bar outside of it as to not die.  Doing so, I ripped the bar off of the wall, including the screws and anchors, so I had 4 small but kind of nasty holes in my wall.  I've never done any sort of drywall repair / spackling / etc, and I figure for under $10 with all I could need, this would do the job.I applied the spackle, smoothed it with the flat end of the tube, and allowed it to dry.  I was able to sand it smooth and then paint over the spackle.  It looks fine now.  I give it a 5 for convenience.  This is more of a multitool for a small repair job, so you'll want to invest more money in proper sanders / putty knives / spackle if you've got many repairs to do.

  I normally don’t write reviews for products, but this one was amazing! I’m in the process of moving out of my apartment in nyc (is there anything worse?) and I needed to fill a few holes I made with wall anchors. I have 0 handy experience but this product was so easy to use. I agree with other reviewers that you definitely should pick up real sandpaper if you want your walls to be flawless but I really only gave it 70% effort and the results were pretty good (my apartment is super old). If you bother to paint over (I didn’t) it’s definitely good as new. A renters dream.

  Very convenient but do not recommend for anything bigger than a nail hole. The texture is difficult to get smooth, if you want to properly patch anything bigger than a nail hole, a tiny one.

  I was initially a little concerned at the size of the tube once received but it ended up being more than needed.  I used this to fill in 2 large lag bolt holes from a TV I previously had mounted on the wall and also 4 decent sized holes from a soundbar that was mounted below it.Application was extremely easy.  I waited about 45 minutes and applied a coat of paint.....by the next morning you could not even tell the holes were ever there.  Highly recommended....if you have an entire house with a lot of patching to do I would probably recommend purchasing a couple tubes though.

  If you have just a few areas you need to patch this is for you.  No need to go to the hardware store and buy the other gear you'd need otherwise.  I had just a couple areas I needed to fill in.  The material is of good quality, not runny or dried up.  The sandpaper patch on the cap is a smart idea.  I had to apply two layers for one gouge and just one layer for the second area damaged.Other than being a three in one (well, 4 with the primer mixed in) it's a way for unskilled persons to patch up.  Paint I applied over the damaged area didn't have any issues with the material.

  UPDATE 6/20: Been happily using these furniture pads and they eventually got all used up! I like to replace the ones on our dinner chairs frequently and always add to new furniture. Has saved floor from plenty of scratches. I recommend changing them out frequently on high traffic items as they eventually collect dirt and debris and get flattened.They seem to stay put just fine! We've been in our house about a month and a half with these on furniture in every room... so far the adhesive is sticking quite impressively. I'm sure after a certain amount of time it will be time to replace them, but they're holding up great for now. These sizes and shapes were great for our furniture. Some of the smaller circles and shapes I ended up using multiples of on different furniture feet to cover the space, but it isn't noticeable. It's actually preferable for the odd sized furniture.I am realizing I maybe should have gotten ""no slide"" feet for a number of our furniture since these make it rather too easy to move our huge couch or the baby's crib when I'm just leading against them. That is not a down-side for this product, so I'm not docking a star, I'm just throwing it out there. I'd recommend buying these & non-slip feet for whichever items you'd prefer not to move so easily.

  These are a good value. They were easy to stick on and seem to be working. I like that there are two colors and different sizes to fit with different furniture.

  These are listed as being incredibly adhesive, and the reviews, some, say they are the best thing out there for felt chair leg pads. Sadly, I cannot return them at this point. They stick for a very small period of time, then fall off, causing my wood floor to be scratched and scuffed. I have replaced a whole bunch of them after only about 3 or 4 weeks of use, because they are constantly coming undone, for no reason that I can see except they just don't stick. On top of that, the felt seriously compresses to flat in a very short period of time. They are almost useless. I'd like to hope this was just a bad batch, but I'm not going to take the chance on buying them again. Not sure why they would work so well for others though, so maybe it is a bad batch. Nevertheless, what we have doesn't work.

It hung by it's built in hook to the top of the tent, the light was just right and the fan was quiet and effective for a 2 person tent.  Happy I bought it.

  I had high hopes for this product and while it works as described, it doesn't have the durability I had hoped for. The led is bright enough to light up a large tent. The light is diffused well and lit up our 8 person tent with ease. The fan provides a decent subtle stream of air and is quiet enough that it won't keep you awake. The end with the fan/led ring is adjustable so you can aim it where you want. The batteries lasted over a week of on/off day and all night use. The light/fan use the same power supply (the batteries) and as a result the light dims a slight amount and the fan slightly slows if you use them at the same time. My reason for 3 stars is the plastic the frame is made of is brittle and weak. We had packed it with our other camping supplies and the plastic end caps came out along some of the plastic chipping. It still functions fine, just wish it was made with more robust materials. If it was produced with higher quality materials this would be a 5 star product for sure. I would still recommend this for those looking for a tent fan/light but would take it easy on it and protect it while in storage.

  I used this camping at the faster horses music festival and it was so nice to have!!! The light is great. Lite up my whole tent. The fan has two settings, low and high. I had it on high every night and it really makes a difference. I have a 3 person tent. It takes 6 D batteries and I used it all night for 4 nights and accidentally had it on the whole 3 hours home in my bag and the batteries are still working. I didn't use the light very long. Love the it just hooks easily. Had it hooked in the top of my tent above me. Love this fan.

  Love the utility use of this product.  Feels plasticy but for the price it does what it says.  Its powered by 2 D cell batteries and is very light weight which is a definite plus.  I definitely recommend getting one for its price and use.Pros:LED light (bright enough for camping/working on vehicles/brown outs)Has a fan (2 modes low/high)Light angle is adjustable(swivels)Unit has a hook to place on a line/ropeLight weight2 D cells(instead of AA/AAA)Cons:2D cells(would if been nice to have come with, hey a guy can dream)Feels cheap(almost like a toy)

  I opened the box. I put in new batteries.  The light wont turn on. The fan works... so that's nice when its 28 degrees outside and you just want to go to sleep. Thankfully I live by ""Two is one and one is none"" so my Streamlight Stinger swooped in to save the day. Do not buy, cheaply made, flimsy and will fail you when you need it the most.  A regular lantern or even a regular flash light aimed at the top of the tent is worth the extra money when you NEED to have light.

  I slipped in the shower the other day, and grabbed my towel bar outside of it as to not die.  Doing so, I ripped the bar off of the wall, including the screws and anchors, so I had 4 small but kind of nasty holes in my wall.  I've never done any sort of drywall repair / spackling / etc, and I figure for under $10 with all I could need, this would do the job.I applied the spackle, smoothed it with the flat end of the tube, and allowed it to dry.  I was able to sand it smooth and then paint over the spackle.  It looks fine now.  I give it a 5 for convenience.  This is more of a multitool for a small repair job, so you'll want to invest more money in proper sanders / putty knives / spackle if you've got many repairs to do.

  I normally don’t write reviews for products, but this one was amazing! I’m in the process of moving out of my apartment in nyc (is there anything worse?) and I needed to fill a few holes I made with wall anchors. I have 0 handy experience but this product was so easy to use. I agree with other reviewers that you definitely should pick up real sandpaper if you want your walls to be flawless but I really only gave it 70% effort and the results were pretty good (my apartment is super old). If you bother to paint over (I didn’t) it’s definitely good as new. A renters dream.

  Very convenient but do not recommend for anything bigger than a nail hole. The texture is difficult to get smooth, if you want to properly patch anything bigger than a nail hole, a tiny one. I do not recommend for wall anchor sized holes and would still recommend a sanding block or sandpaper to get a proper smooth finish to blend to paint.

  Absolutely love this product! Completely repairs dings, damages, and holes to drywall (that a lardlord would charge $100+ for) in one product.Used to fix a large wall ding above my bed that was very unattractive. Spackle easily coated and covered the ding (applied with fingers). Flattened spackled surface with the sharp edge on the bottle.Allowed to dry overnight.Sanded down surface with the smoother disk on the cap... No scrapings or dust spilled at all while sanding, left perfectly smooth surface. Painted over and it's gone!

  I was initially a little concerned at the size of the tube once received but it ended up being more than needed.  I used this to fill in 2 large lag bolt holes from a TV I previously had mounted on the wall and also 4 decent sized holes from a soundbar that was mounted below it.Application was extremely easy.  I waited about 45 minutes and applied a coat of paint.....by the next morning you could not even tell the holes were ever there.  Highly recommended....if you have an entire house with a lot of patching to do I would probably recommend purchasing a couple tubes though.

  If you have just a few areas you need to patch this is for you.  No need to go to the hardware store and buy the other gear you'd need otherwise.  I had just a couple areas I needed to fill in.  The material is of good quality, not runny or dried up.  The sandpaper patch on the cap is a smart idea.  I had to apply two layers for one gouge and just one layer for the second area damaged.Other than being a three in one (well, 4 with the primer mixed in) it's a way for unskilled persons to patch up.  Paint I applied over the damaged area didn't have any issues with the material.

  I purchased the big pack because it was only a bit more for a ton more felt fuzzies. I had a couple antique chairs that were scratching my floor.I fixed the chairs, then used some to stop a couple picture frames from vibrating. Then I put some on the bottom of several decorative bowls and vases so they don’t vibrate anymore.I stacked about ten together to stop a folding desk from slamming when you shut it.I leveled a lamp, then I leveled my dining room table.I put some of the strips along my bedroom door’s frame so it closes more snugly now.I stuck a couple to the walls to protect them from chairs and doors dinging them.Seriously, these things are fantastic!

  These are working great so far. I have applied them to a few furniture items as we are laying down new bamboo flooring. We have not had to move the items too much, but this far these do a good job balancing allowing movement while not slipping too easily, and have prevented any scuff marks or other damage on the new floor planks.

  UPDATE 6/20: Been happily using these furniture pads and they eventually got all used up! I like to replace the ones on our dinner chairs frequently and always add to new furniture. Has saved floor from plenty of scratches. I recommend changing them out frequently on high traffic items as they eventually collect dirt and debris and get flattened.They seem to stay put just fine! We've been in our house about a month and a half with these on furniture in every room... so far the adhesive is sticking quite impressively. I'm sure after a certain amount of time it will be time to replace them, but they're holding up great for now. These sizes and shapes were great for our furniture. Some of the smaller circles and shapes I ended up using multiples of on different furniture feet to cover the space, but it isn't noticeable. It's actually preferable for the odd sized furniture.I am realizing I maybe should have gotten ""no slide"" feet for a number of our furniture since these make it rather too easy to move our huge couch or the baby's crib when I'm just leading against them. That is not a down-side for this product, so I'm not docking a star, I'm just throwing it out there. I'd recommend buying these & non-slip feet for whichever items you'd prefer not to move so easily.

  These are a good value. They were easy to stick on and seem to be working. I like that there are two colors and different sizes to fit with different furniture. My only complaint is that the adhesive backing came off when I pulled several of the smaller circles off of the paper to use them, so I ended up having to throw a bunch of them away.

  These are listed as being incredibly adhesive, and the reviews, some, say they are the best thing out there for felt chair leg pads. Sadly, I cannot return them at this point. They stick for a very small period of time, then fall off, causing my wood floor to be scratched and scuffed. I have replaced a whole bunch of them after only about 3 or 4 weeks of use, because they are constantly coming undone, for no reason that I can see except they just don't stick. On top of that, the felt seriously compresses to flat in a very short period of time. They are almost useless. I'd like to hope this was just a bad batch, but I'm not going to take the chance on buying them again. Not sure why they would work so well for others though, so maybe it is a bad batch. Nevertheless, what we have doesn't work.

  PROS:• A must have to protect hardwood or laminated floors• Pads are soft and will not scratch the floors• Works well as padding to protect walls from scuffs, and works especially well as a door stop to prevent the door handle from denting the wall• Allows heavy furniture to be moved very easily and glide across the floor, especially useful when vacuuming and cleaning the house• Adhesive is fairly strong and does not fall off, even on non-smooth surfaces like on the bottom legs of furnitures (see photos)• Eliminates that screeching and ear-deafening sound of dragging furniture across the floor• Many different size pads to fit all types of shapes• Works well as cabinet bumpers to dampen the sound when closing cabinet doorsCONS:• Can be dangerous around small children, as it allows furniture to glide very easily

   Note: Requires 3 AA batteries.Pros:- Surprisingly lightweight for the size.- Feel solid; not cheap-o China plastic.- Bright: They've packed in some many LEDs it's ridiculous how bright this thing gets.- Versatile: I hang this and also simply put it on the table like regular lantern.- Low-profile: It folds up compact and is black (not an annoyingly loud color). It looks almost tactical.- Easy: It's so easy to turn on.  Simple open it up and *bam* it's on (see video). No need to fumble in the dark for a tiny switch or button.Cons:- We had a cabin fire and I threw this out the window to break the glass so we could escape.  It got lost in the bushes, and now I am saddened that my lantern is missing.  This has been a test to see if you've read my review this far.  If so, congratulations. I owe you lunch.

  We are campers. These compact, easy to use lanterns are ideal, especially for their price. For such a little laterns and not many batteries, these put off a good amount of light.. I suppose due to the led bulbs that are used in them. The hanging feature is great as well. We could place this on our picnic table or have the option to hang from the interior hook built into the roof of our tent. It provided plenty of light for us to take care of before bed things. These are a great addition to our camping bins. Shortly after we arrived home our house power had gone out, we grabbed one of these and were no longer sitting in the dark until my husband could get our generator going. I may buy a couple more to keep around the house.. much better than a flashlight in those situations, as they are directional light and these light up a room quite well.

   I dropped it and it didn't break. They both light up very well, and the plastic doesn't seem to crack or break. I was happy to find that the batteries are included. It's a very simple, straight forward approach. These will light up a tent well, provide a work area, and help when the power goes out. The handles hang well. There is no flashlight feature. These are simple straight forward Lanterns.

  I can't  say enough good things about these mini L.E.D. lanterns.When I rate a product, one of the most important criteria is, Value For The Dollar.These lanterns certainly deliver.They are light, compact and very bright.There are others on the market for a little less and some for a little more.My decision in purchasing these was that they were plastic. No rusting of the base or the body.The batteries seem to last forever.They are bright enough, that if you lock your eyes on them, your vision will get a little blurred.At roughly $7. a light, I feel I got great value for the dollar.I did read some reviews on other brands and read comments about some of the ones with the metal bases, rusting up after contact with moisture.😎 JS SAYN

  Decent brightness and very rugged design.  I plan to use these as backup light when power goes out (for two to three days at a time) and for camping.  This is designed and built for room lighting, not reading.  It's a sufficient light to get around a campsite or a room, it's good for eating.  Many lights are so concentrated, so bright, that they ruin a campsite.  These are slightly less bright than our Coleman propane light, fitting well with our intended use.

  I bought these for camping.  So easy to use, super bright, super small and very lightweight. Thinking of buying more for power outages and whatnot. It's also nice that there's no switch.  Just pull up and it turns on so you can adjust the brightness by how far you pull the top up. Easy in the dark! It also came with batteries which was a nice change of pace.  Highly recommend! Oh, and they were much less $ then some others I saw.

  Worked pretty well plus has a brush to loosen up the lint.  The hose connector is a little loose and pops off but not a big deal.  It worked exceptionally well a lot easier than taking off the dryer vent screws and vacuuming that way.  I didn’t rate the suction power bec that relates to your own vacuum cleaner.

If the camera is shared with any accounts I would suggest the shared account holder also resets their passwords.Next, to talk a little about our security. Our cameras utilize a point to point encrypted connection, this means that when you attempt to connect to a camera (specifically connection step 2/3) the camera and the app will perform a handshake with our servers, confirming that both have the correct encryption key that is unique to the device. This means that currently, the only options for getting access to your live feed is to have the log in information of an account with control over the camera (either the account it is setup to, or a shared account) or an Alexa device that you have allowed access to your live feeds (again, this requires the log in information for the account).anyway we changed the password and this just happened yesterday. i hope they can explain this....

   This little camera is VERY impressive. I currently own a Nest IQ indoor camera and have owned a couple Foscam indoor cameras in the past. This Wyze camera produces excellent picture quality and has a very easy to use app. The fact that you get 14 days of clips storage for free just blows the Nest cam out of the water.This camera does so much that the 10x more expensive Nest Cam IQ at a fraction of the price.So how does this stack up against the much more expensive Nest Cam IQ indoor camera?* You don't get continuous recording stored online, you only get clips stored online. However, you can pop a $10 32GB microSD card into this Wyze camera and get continuous local recording (meaning it's being recorded on the card in the device). You can view your recordings in the app. At HD quality, you get a couple days storage on a 32GB card, more if you go SD quality.*You don't get the ability to turn the camera on/off based on whether or not you are home. Personally, I really like this feature so it isn't recording us when we're home. Just feels weird. Wyze support says they may add this via IFTTT in the future. You can control whether or not motion recording is on when you are home using IFTTT. However, I""ve found it a little buggy.*You don't get the Nest IQ facial recognition which is very high tech. I'm not sure how important this is for an indoor camera. It's amazing for the Nest Hello doorbell.*You don't get a monthly fee with the Wyze cam. You pay a fee for the Nest Cam IQ.I can't believe this thing is so cheap and works so well. It has so many features like the big guys. Even the two-way audio is decent. If I had one complaint, it's that the motor that rotates the camera is a little loud. I'm still giving this 5 stars. I guess its sensitivity to sound is a little high too.It seems like it's too good to be true. If you are looking for an indoor security camera, you found it.TIP: I am using this SD card in the camera and it's working fine. Inexpensive and does the job if you want local recording - .

  Only good as a toy in close by propertiesIf your internet goes down then back up as it always sometime does in New York City or State the camera will sometimes not reconnect to your WiFi network as it has happened with 3/4 cameras .Since the camera is not responding to either WiFi or LTE your only option is to manually unplug it then plug it in againThis would solve the issue but what happens when you are a 1000 miles away ?Until Wyze ( like Nest does ) codes the software so that the camera reboots itself when attempting to re- connect these cameras are just a gimmick to watch your cat .I am not the only one having same issue as I got numerous emails from forumYou can try to fix by having WiFi AC plugs turning on Pandora off but not reliable

  I'm a bit of a camera addict.  I have hardwired (fixed) cameras that are hooked up to a DVR, and I have 4 Nest cams as well. But we have a lot of pets, and I wanted to have some PTZ cams to be able to look around and check on them when we are away.  I heard several tech podcasts (TWiT, Stacey on IoT) ranting and raving over this Wyze cam, so I took the plunge on one. WOW, how amazing to get all this, for $30 (plus shipping)!  The image is super-clear, and I LOVE the ability to scan around a room via my phone.  I even installed the Wyze app onto my Pixelbook, and when I enlarge the image on my big screen, it looks incredible.  I have only had the camera hooked up for a day, and I am still learning the ropes, but I am SO pleased, I am going to order another two, if not three cameras right away!The motion detection feature is pretty slick.  I set up the camera in our spare bedroom, where some of our cats hang out, and when Barbie came in, the camera detected her and began following her movements.  She was intrigued at the noise (noticeable, but not loud, btw) of the camera whirring, turning.  I have attached a screenshot I grabbed via the app, where she is examining the Wyze cam!  Highly recommended.

I'll get a stain on it and it won't get cleaned for quite some time until I'm ready to clean the carpets and it comes right out.  On really good stains,  I'll shoot out a little extra cleaner onto the stain and let it soak in a couple minutes and then go over it.  My Carpets almost look NEW even though they aren't.  I'm seeing some of these other pictures and the carpets are nasty.  I would never let my carpets get in that condition.  I'd be embarrassed for anyone coming over and seeing that.I normally go over each section a couple times.  Do my whole house.  Then start all over and just use water.  I always use HOT Water also.  Just using water, I still get more dirt out.  In the end, the carpets are nice and clean.  I make sure I go over them a few times to make sure it sucks up as much water as it can as it'll dry out faster.  I think the Scotch Gaurd helps getting the carpet clean once again.  So you need to use this stuff before the stains are there so that they are scotch guard protected.  Depending on how dirty your carpet is, is what level to set the machine.  A hallway, for example, gets a lot of traffic.  Heavy use!!!  If it's not really that dirty, set it to normal.  Then you don't go through the cleaner so fast.Some people maybe should look at not wearing shoes in the house!!!  I don't know what you're doing to get your carpet so nasty, but this stuff is not a miracle worker.  You have to care a little bit about where you live.  Clean far more often.  Maybe use one of the small machines to clean right away just so the carpet doesn't look like a disaster zone.  Looking not as bad as before is not good.  If should look NEW when done.  If you take care of your carpet, it will last a very long time.

  This cleaner is amazing!!! It is a little on the expensive side but WELL worth it and actually saves you time and money in the long run. I have probably used every carpet cleaning solution on the market and this one beats them all hands down. I have 3 dogs and 3 kids and I also foster animals who are not always potty trained.  This cleaner works so well that you would never know I have pets. I have used other cleaners and have had to do a couple passes with my steam cleaner just to get my floors really clean. I was beyond impressed with how great it worked after only one pass! It even got up stains that other products have left behind. I can now clean a room in half the time it used to take because I don't have to go over the carpet again and again. It scent isn't over powering and it got rid of every odor my carpet had absorbed. I really saw a difference when I ran out of this product half way through cleaning my sons carpet. I grabbed what I had left of another cleaner, that I used to really like, and I was surprised at the difference in my carpet. The other cleaner left my carpet looking dingy and a little rough. This cleaner left the carpet very soft and extreemly clean. I love it and won't use anything else again!

  Best carpet cleaning solution I've ever used in 36 years of doing it myself.  I've tried about every cleaning solution on earth.  I have a light Berber carpet in my home office that is heavily used by me and my English Cocker girl.  It has been getting progressively darker, with obvious signs of traffic for about 13 years.  It is high quality carpet, but I'd been thinking it may be time to ditch it.  That would be difficult due to the heavy bookcases and a built-in granite desk in the room.Along comes Bissell 78H6B to save the day!  I had to go over the carpet several times due to the years of ground in dirt and stain, but it's clean.  My office floor now looks like it was installed new yesterday.  The regular plush carpet in my front entry and living-dining room has been rehabilitated now also.  It had some recurring stains from my Cocker's early mistakes that had me cleaning that carpet about every two months for five years.  It now looks new also, with no evidence of her inexperience left to be noticed.Unbelievable!  I'd give this carpet cleaning solution 10 stars if I could.  I use a Bissell machine, too.  Easy to use and clean up afterwards.

  I tried this and at first thought nothing could clean our carpets .I live in a apartment and the carpeting as been here for a long time and through many other renters.They never changed it and even though they had it cleaned before I moved in, The stains popped back up after just a few weeks of living here .The carpet was looking horrible and went through a few winters and lots of tracking through with shoes on and with the already stained spots it was horrible to look at.I was desperate and bought a carpet cleaner and my husband thought we should try this .Well I did not think anything could clean this carpet , or get the stains out that have been here since the place was built and the news ones made from my two cats.Well to our surprised it worked.Not only did it get it looking clean , but it made it look new and I also use it for spot touch ups when my cats throw up from time to time , as cats do .I love this product and will continue using it and recommending it to anyone who wants to have a clean carpet that looks great.

  I suffered for many years from a severe case of carpel tunnel syndrome.  It probably all began because I work for a commercial designing company, and I spend about 8-10 hours a day doing 3D rendering on the computer, which entails a lot of using the keypad and mouse. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with tingling in my hands and sometimes with severe pain. I spent many restless nights twisting and turning in bed.I was advised by my Dr. to try wearing a night brace, and desperate to find a solution to the endless pain I stopped into my local pharmacy to pick up a handbrace from a big brand. I wore it for a few weeks and didn't see any difference, the pain at night was still severe and sleeping at night was almost a thing of the past. Nothing was working until I bought this comfybrace.After using this brace for one night I realized this was really making a big difference. I right away saw major improvement. After months of not being able to sleep at night I started getting a couple of hours of shut eye in a row!! This was a major breakthrough for me. Now that i'm wearing it for two weeks, night pain is a thing of the past. I thought surgery was my only solution, but maybe this is an easier solution!!!This comfybrace is made of durable material which makes it very soft yet sturdy and therefore my hands weren't sweaty from it. Another thing which was very important to me was the super soft and comfortable cushioning beads by the palm. The beads are soft enough that they got molded to the shape of my hand and hold my hand perfectly in that position.My hands are pretty average size for a man, and this glove fits me perfectly!! This brace is really adjustable so it would probably fit most hand sizes, including pretty slim hands and husky ones too.This brace is also made of very high quality materials and is stitched together very strongly. I can see that this will really last me a while. You can also see the picture I have attached showing the high quality stitching.I highly recommend this brace, and it's definitely worth the money. It's not worth  wasting nights when there is such an easy and affordable solution available.Thank you so much Comfy Brace!!!

  I am an RN and have severe issues with carpel tunnel for a very long time that wakes me up frequently from sleep and causes pain when trying to lift or crochet. In fact many nights, the pain is unbearable with numbness in my fingers and stabbing burning elbow and wrist pain. I have tried many braces before and while some have helped, most have been too uncomfortable to wear at night so I have not been consistent in using them. I was hesitant to buy another one, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give this one a try. The first time I put it on I knew it was different with the padding and overall comfort. One of my biggest issues was most other braces felt very warm and making my arm feel clammy and hot, and being from South Texas, I don't want anything making me feel warmer than we already are. I slept all night that first night and most other nights since using it. While I know a brace wont eliminate the problem completely, I recommend this brace for anyone dealing with this painful and annoying issue especially during flare ups of the condition and symptoms. I am getting another just to have for travel as I am very impressed with this product. Whoever created this must have had the issue of carpal tunnel and been frustrated with the current braces on the market and fixed them!! Bravo to you!!

  In the past year or so, I've started twisting one hand and wrist under my head as I sleep, which results in hand swelling and pain when I wake up. My doctor suggested wearing a brace to discourage me from twisting my wrist as I sleep.Well! Easier said than done! I tried two or three braces before this one. One was okay to wear but barely provided any support and did not prevent the twist. Another gave firmer support but was so uncomfortable that I removed in in my sleep (yeah, lifelong sleepwalker here).So then I tried the Comfy Brace. I was a little dubious since it does not come in a right or left hand version, the brace will fit either hand which I thought might mean it would not fit well. I was sooo wrong.Wowza, it works a charm! The three straps provide a more customisable fit so it can be firm enough to discourage the twist but still comfortable enough that I leave it on in my sleep. The cushion full of beads is brilliant--I put it on, wiggle my fingers once or twice, the beads shift into position and I honestly can't feel the metal support (part of the problem with the uncomfortable brace was that the end of the metal support tended to dig into my palm).It has definitely helped my wrist and hand without being uncomfortable at all. It fits like it was made specifically for my hand. Either hand! I've only used it for a couple months, so I don't know yet how it will last (still feels like new). If I ever wear it out, I'll buy another. No more experimenting, this is definitely the perfect design for me.

  This lock always was “sticky” and jammed constantly. Not the situation you want to be in on a cold night trying to unlock your bike in a sketchy hood to go home. I always wondered if it was me, or if I inadvertently re set it but then at the last minute would unlock! After a min. of 10-15 minutes. Finally it did not after two people tried & I had to cut the cable clean off with my Dremel, (plastic cutting disc and metal cutting disc) which I was just lucky enough to have nearby. Every time this jammed on me, it was always a bad time for it to happen. Also I have to physically wrestle with the too strong cable which never relaxed, always strangling my bike and stressing me out.This is really a 5 star review for the Dremel!

  I was using this to secure my bike on my front porch, and literally within a 10 minute window someone came up and cut this lock and stole my husband's brand new bike. I am not a happy camper. NO I do NOT recommend this. I live in what I felt to be a generally safe neighborhood and yet a thief cut through this like it was child's play. The police officer that came said it looked like they cut it with just a knife, which was rare. Yet shows how cheap the cable lock is!

  This lock lasted less than a week before my bike was stolen. The thief broke the lock at the ""key"" insert. From the fracture, it's easy to see that the material used was very brittle. Save your bike and time. Get a meaty u-lock. My bike was not worth much so I took a chance and now I feel like a fool.

  This is an economic but durable solution for situation when you want to lock your bike in a public place. The section of the cable is by no means thick enough to deter anyone who really wants your bike. I would not let my bike with this lock overnight in critical areas, but this lock is fantastic when you stroll downtown and stop for a coffee or lunch somewhere. It comes with a fix combination, meaning you cannot set a more memorable one for yourself. Make sure you mark the four digits down somewhere (phone, maybe?) so you do not look like an idiot trying to steal your own bike!

  Going with the Master Lock brand I thought it'd be a solid build. It was cheap, but I didn't expect it to be cheaply constructed. It all works as intended, it's just not very sturdy. One of the locks fell apart when my kid dropped it off his handlebars. The number wheels literally fell off. I didn't try yanking it apart when it was locked but it made me less trusting that it'd stand a good tug if someone wanted the bike.I'd recommend you spend a few extra dollars for something sturdier.-- This is how I rate my purchases --5 Stars: Product works exactly as advertised, is a good value at the price point purchased, and I would buy it again or recommend to a friend.4 Stars: Product works exactly as advertised, fit/finish are what you'd expect when purchasing this type of product, but the product may leave more to be desired.3 Stars: Product generally works but it may not be a good value at the price point or may need some improvement. I probably wouldn't buy it again.2 Stars: Product barely works but can be made useful if you try. I would not recommend for purchase.1 Star : Product does not perform as intended and in my opinion is probably a waste of money.That's my review scale. I also want to point out that if I receive a product that I would give three stars or below to I usually contact the vendor and let them know the problem. The vast majority of the time they are willing to replace or refund my purchase. This is why you'll see very few three or under review from me. I hope that is of some help to everyone!If this review was helpful I would love it if you could reply YES to the question below ""Was this review helpful to you?"" Thanks so much!

  First and foremost if you use the adhesive pads these come with expect them not to hold for very long.  They will stick initially but then will come free after a week or two, or faster if they are exposed to heat like sunlight.  I would peel off the adhesive disk and replace it with some 3M VHB.The rubber for the holders is firm, and quality.  Holds cords just fine.  In my experience they don’t lose their integrity or begin seeping oils or anything.  I say this because some others I have used do this and get oily or sticky after a while.  These don’t.

  I saw these on a YouTube video about how well they work and how well they make your desk look. I bought the pack of them figuring I would use one or two. But I used them all except for one. What a difference it made instead of having wires all over the place!! Check out the pictures and you can hardly see any wires at all on my desk.Please ignore the wires on the walls,I am in the process of hiding all of them as well.They are made out of soft rubber that will last for years.Some things made of rubber have a bad smell These smell like Steak!! lol just kidding they have no smell at all, the adhesive is fantastic!!! I used rubbing alcohol to clean the spot where I was going to stick it too. one of those rubber clips has the weight of a extension cord pulling on it and it has not pulled off the clip yet and its been roughly 5 days now.But on the other hand you can take these off without hurting the furniture. I decided to take a clip off and figured i probably couldn't reuse it. It took some force to remove but it came off and I was able to use it in another spot. These things are GREAT!! I should of gotten them years ago!!

  Years ago I upgraded the phone cord in my bedroom to a 10ft cord. Life changing! However, even when I tuck it under my pillow in the morning when I get up, half the time, it falls down behind my headboard, and I have to fish it back out when I get in bed at night. Did I mention I've been doing this for years?! So when I saw this product, I thought, OMFG, maybe this will finally solve one of my most annoying little first world problems. And it has indeed delivered!I stuck one on my headboard, slightly below where my mattress hits, so it's not visible. Hooked the phone cord on, and voila! When the cord falls off my bed, it's still hanging on this! Such a stupid simple thing, but it's so annoying to have to get up once you're all wrapped in your blankets, and go fishing for a phone cord. I've also stuck a couple of these in my car, to help organize the cords in there, and in my desk area at home and work. Super super handy little things!!

  These are great!  Exactly what I wanted for routing a couple of cords around.  The single slot clips are big enough to fit a standard cord or a light duty indoor extension cord, but it's still small enough that I was able to put my USB-C cable for my phone in it without it just falling out.I'm not sure why I've seen so many people saying that they should have 3m tape instead of generic, or that they had to replace the tape on them with 3m.  The tape on these is clearly marked with the 3m branding.

  Not one of the adhesive stickers has stuck to the smooth plastic surface in the car.  I cleansed with 409, dawn and then rinse and dry and I tried prepping the surface with alcohol. Not one of the stickers has stayed put.  Avoid this product or maybe the ones I got were duds.  The holder part looks well made but that doesn’t really matter when they don’t stay put. I tried them on a 50 degree day and on a 65 degree day.  Not applied in direct sunlight or really hot heat.  I’m stumped.  What a waste of time and money.

  I wanted to like these. I mean they are a great concept, but the execution of their primary function - organising cables and keeping them organised - is sorely lacking.The primary issue with these cable clips is that there is too much of a gap in each slot to really hold anything in place. As you try to slide a cable in/out, it more often than not pops out of the channel it's supposed to rest in, which kind of renders the whole thing pointless.These need to be made so that the gap between grip points is significantly smaller, thus allowing the cable to be inserted and slid back and forth without coming out until you really want it to.Off to find something better...

  Ordered this set for office, home, and vehicle use.The ones at my desk stay stuck just fine. They're on a flat surface for cable management and have little to no friction or downward pull. At home they're just fine too. Also on a flat, horizontal surface with little to no friction or pull.But the ones in my car that I use to organize my wires for AUX and charging have already fallen off after about 2 weeks of being in place on a vertical surface with light to no tugging or friction. I'll be looking into how to replace the adhesive on the bottom with something a bit stronger; as this was the primary reason I bought them.

  These cable clips actually have a strong grip.  I got mine for holding pens, and I accidentally stuck on in an off center position and can't get it off.  I mean, I can't get it off ! ! !  Its ok with me though, because the last 3 pen holders i bought either fell off on their own or peeled off easily.  These adhesive on these is tough and I like that!I purchased this on Amazon, thought I haven't seen the ""VERIFIED PURCHASE"" checkbox on any of my reviews for the last two years.

  I read mixed reviews about whether this was waterproof or not (needed to patch a couple intex above ground vinyl pool leaks). I tried it both inside and outside the (filled) pool, and neither worked in any way that could be called successful.We have some other tape that worked really well on the outside of the pool, so this is just an inferior product. I do not recommend using this for anything water-related. As soon as it was applied to the leak in the image, it bubbled up and leaked (the surrounding area was dried off first just to give it the best chance possible). As soon as the other tape was applied, there was no bubble at all and no leak.The funny part was when we tried to apply it on the inside underwater (the reason I bought this tape in the first place). We cut it into a circle and applied it as fast as possible, but it simply didn't stick except for the tiniest area. It lost all adhesion to the rest of the patch area and was completely ineffective at stopping the leak.

  Difficult to cut, virtually impossible to tear, and grabs immediately with a bond on hard surfaces is so strong that it is daunting to remove (so position it right the first time.) All of which are highly desirable characteristics in a ""patch and seal"" tape. At my house It is performing beautifully as a patch for a damaged gutter corner lasting through 90+ degree heat, freezing cold, and driving rain. Even better it is almost unnoticeable and is likely to remain as the permanent repair.  The only failure I have encountered was an attempt to patch a hole in my car's underwood insulation, it did not stick to the fabric but presented a real challenge to remove where it had stuck to the metal along one edge.  I have seen complaints that the edge of the roll is sticky, and it is, but that can be handy when you are working on a ladder or in a precarious location. Just slap the roll on a nearby hard surface and it isn't going to roll or fall off while you are working.I have tried competing products, but none of them performed as well as Gorilla Weatherproof Patch and Seal Tape/

  I patched several holes in vinyl skirting today and the tape was simple to work with.  Unpeel about half the tape, stick it in place and unpeel the rest, rubbing the edges down well.  I used a box knife with a fresh blade to cut the tape.  Goo-Gone took off the adhesive residue from the blade when I was done.  Will update this review when some time has passed re: weather proofing and long term adherence.  So far, so good!

  I used this tape to seal window casings in a sun room in my home that has excessive dry rot. The windows really need to be replaced but we don’t want to put money into the room because we intend to tear it down when we eventually add an addition. The wood was cracking and weak in places. I used this tape to seal off whatever outside elements were trying to make their way in and keep the casing from further cracking. I’m guessing bad things are still going to happen behind the tape, but it worked great for my purposes. Tape is strong and smooth and the white blends in so you don’t notice it too much. I would purchase again for such a “repair” - the only annoying thing was the sticky side is a grey color and would sometimes peek out on the sides of the tape, the way glue would push out when you push two surfaces together. I should have just left it alone but instead I tried to rub it away with my nail and it seemed to make it worse. It was like trying to remove sticky adhesive when you tear a label off something and have to push the adhesive into a clump and pick that clump up with the label, tape, or your fingernails. Anyways, not a deal breaker by any means, but when trying to maintain all white against my white painted wood the grey spots were more noticeable than I anticipated.

  Not sure if it is quality control, old stock or a bad product, but this item started unfurling after opening it. I gave 5 stars for ""easy to remove"" as a joke since it did not go on. Thought I was doing something wrong like there was a backing I wasn't aware of, but no, just poor product. May work if batch is good, but I am not willing to try. As a side note, if there are rolls that work, it seems designed well. Smooth, shiny surface with cushioning between surface and adhesion side. Too bad, but beware the failure of this one may be a sign of its long-term reliability.

  Love how well it works!We didn't drain the pool enough and the tape got wet but once the tape dries it gets sticky again. Definitely worth the money if you need to repair and are not ready to replace. Saved us $6,000 for a new liner, now will save up for new liner next year.

   After X'mas I realized these LED light strips will be my main holiday lights in the future! We attach the strips inside the house alongside the window frames, people can see the lights from outside, how amazing! Here is my daughter's feedback:These lights are amazing!! There are 20 colors and lots of different modes. There’s slow changing modes, fast changing modes as well as modes that change to the dynamics of the music you are playing! I personally like the red purple and blue because it’s darker and great for a great vibe. Also, the lights automatically turn off after a long while if you don’t change color or do anything and that’s great because it helps you save electricity if you fall asleep. There’s tape on the back of the lights so it makes it easy to tape to the wall. Love it!

  It worked great for the first couple days, stuck on really well, was very bright, i was so happy with it. Not even 4 days after i got it it starts randomly changing. I usually keep it on the fade mode and all of a sudden it will just start flashing or go to one of the music modes. I made sure the remote was far away from me so i wasn’t touching it by accident and closed the app on my phone just in case and it still keeps happening. Waste of money and all the time it took to set up.EDIT: It ended up being my tv remote that was interfering with it, so keep that in mind if your lights keep changing out of nowhere.

  For the price, I can't ask for more.  I've bought a variety of different styles of lights over the years, and thus far I like these the best.  Not only is the adhesive VERY effective on these, but the connection to the phone app was super easy.  Others in the past have always had problems connecting to the phone.  Not these!  I bought this particular set for my daughter's play room and she adjusts them with her tablet.  She's 10 and can use the app without an issue, so it's definitely a winner in my book.

  These lights are lit!I put them behind and underneath my bed and it just looks awesome! I got a smart plus for Alexa and so now they turn on when I ask for ambience light. I am in love!The one thing I would say is plan where you want them before you stick them because once you stick them, it would be hard to remove and re-do.Other than that, great buy for the price!

  I installed these in my bedroom and I love them.  I ended up using tape, and will probably go to the store and buy something a bit more proper as far as adhesives go.  The kit doesn't come with nearly enough adhesive tabs, like 12, and if you really want to frame elements with the lights, you'll need more.  But as far as the product goes, couldn't be better- really really cool, everything I wanted.  I really cant believe these are only 22 bucks.  I will definitely be ordering more and get my whole house lit.

  I got these for my daughter's bedroom makeover and they really helped to transform the space! They give off a good amount of light for our bedtime podcast listening, but I love the feature to control with the app. It's easy to turn the lights off so they aren't on all day (let's be real, kids aren't going to always remember). It was very easy to hook up with my phone and set everything up. I'd purchase again!

  I use these and a straight pair (from Home Depot) to prune my plants and especially, wet trim my Flower... and I always find myself going to these over the others.The curved tip makes it super easy to get in there and snipped tiny bits, like sugar leaves. They are very precise. I couldnt imagine trimming/ pruning without these. They are sharp and hold up to quite a bit of abuse. Like all my other pruners, I completley removed the little plastic lock; as they sometimes lock themselves when you close them during a cut! The spring in them is strong enough to always return them to the open position quick and snappy. Im not sure how much the ""coating"" (gold finish) helps? I find that I have to clean them of sticky residue as often as any other tool, it may help with the smoothness of shearing though?PROS:Very smooth cutting actionBuilt to lastVery durableSharpStrong Snappy SpringVery accurate (curved tip keeps it tight)High quality material/ BuildLightweightErgonomicCONS:sometimes lock themselves when in closed position (I just removed the lock; problem solved)If you found my review helpful - it would be much appreciated if you pass that help along and kindly click the found ""helpful"" button.

  My sweet lil' green-thumb wife was using house-hold scissors from the dollar store, which hurt her hands, resulting in blisters sometimes.  I ordered this tool, and now I'm a hero.  I like it when that happens;  it increases domestic tranquility, and even results in a kiss, or so.  She loves them so much, she keeps them in the blister-pack when not in use.  Yes, she is very proud of her new garden shear, and shows it off to friends.  What a gal!

But these bad ass trimmers are quality made and sharp as all get out.I trimmed up a pound of cannabis buds and these little pruners performed awesomely, better than my Fiskars.I have a successful homebased business, a cannabis garden and I need reliable tools to help me process my product, and I found it in these trimmers by Vivosun.

  These are perfect!  I've had these over a week & have already used them nearly every day. They get right into tiny or close spots & snip stems right off, they work great for deadheading or cutting flowers including roses, petunias, pansies, dianthus pinks, vinca, coreopsis, whatever!  My mint, oregano & rosemary herbs were trying to flower & I trimmed the tops right off all of them lickity-split faster than ever before. They actually make deadheading flowers & plants fun because it's so easy!  Plus they are small & light so they don't hurt or tire my hands to use & I can easily open & close the lock one handed so I can quickly snip, snip, snip away!  I think I may buy a second pair because they are so handy. The only thing I wish is that they had a cap because they easily fit right in my pocket but that end is super pointy, I'm surprised I haven't poked or scratched myself on them yet lol. However that is my only ""negative"" & certainly not a big enough issue to detract a review star or my enthusiasm for these great little clippers!  If you have plants or flowers buy these, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them! 👍👍**One month update**I still LOVE these clippers!  They have been used almost daily to deadhead my flowers & my flowers show their happiness at that!  I really don’t know how I got by without them before & I find it to be very relaxing to use these each evening to dead head & clean up my plants, I find myself almost disappointed if I can’t find anything to snip off lol.  If you have flowers, herbs or other plants you need these!! 🌟⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟

  Take a moment to look at the picture I've included. This did not happen from harsh use or prying with the blades. This is what happened to one of the blades of these gardening scissors when I placed it in over-the-counter, 70% ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL for a few minutes to disinfect before use.The end has literally curled up. It was perfectly straight when I opened them to place them in the 70% isopropyl alcohol. I placed them with the blades down inside a glass. There was no pressure on them.The metal literally softened in simple drugstore alcohol. Gravity did the rest.Needless to say, I do not recommend these. In fact, I enthusiastically warn you away from these if you want something made from stainless steel—because stainless steel does not melt in isopropyl alcohol.These were Amazon's Choice for ""garden scissors."" Don't trust the algorithm that determines this this ""choice"" to deliver quality. ""Amazon's Choice,"" particularly lately for me, has become synonymous with ""the cheapest trash we'd like to move fast."" I've had to return several items that were all Amazon Choice items.

  These hand pruners are fairly cheaply made, except for the actual cutting surfaces. The plastic components feel flimsy and the lock does not inspire much confidence. They do however get the job done. For smaller plants (ferns as opposed to more resilient vegetation) this cuts with ease. I would expect them to handle anything much more. 6.5"" refers to the total length of the tool, not the blades.PROS:+ Inexpensive+ Quality blades+ Cuts smaller plans wellCONS:- Not the highest of quality- Lock feels especially weak

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"PUR Water Pitcher Replacement Filter with Lead Reduction, 3 Pack, Blue Packaging May Vary",$24.88,1.0,"
  These filters consistently under-perform.  The manufacturer claims up to 40 gallons or approximately 2 months for a filter. That's a lie. I've been keeping track and measuring every drop of water I drink. They barely last me 10 gallons - which works out to around 2 weeks for me. Then the water starts flowing so slowly through them that I can fill the pitcher before bed and it still hasn't filtered completely by morning, 8 hours later. If it takes all day to filter a couple glasses of water then they're useless in any practical sense. It'd take a lifetime to actually put 40 gallons of water through with the way it slows down.At first I considered maybe the possibility I got counterfeit or generic filters from Amazon sellers so I've been giving it another chance purchasing them in person at two different major retailers. I've tried both the lead reduction and the standard filter. Not a single one works for more than about 2 weeks. In some cases I've had them clog up and start moving slowly after just a few days. I've a couple mysteriously work a lot longer than the rest, but even those didn't make it to the 2 month mark.Yes I've followed the directions on the packaging with regards to soaking them etc, ensuring they sink in my soaking container and there's no trapped air bubbles. I've tried the tricks where you shake them or run water through them backwards. (The fact people even have to post tips & tricks and elaborate instructions to make them work should tell you something.)I've concluded not only are these simply are not a good value, but the manufacturer is deceptive in their claims. I'm not only going to switch to a different system ASAP but I'm going to research my options for a class action lawsuit. Looking through other reviews here and complaints all across the Internet I'm not alone and this particular product has *really* annoyed me. (Nothing worse than be thirsty on a hot day and seeing the water you poured into the pitcher HOURS ago is still sitting at the top!) Somebody needs to fight back on behalf of all the negative reviews and other ripped off consumers.

  I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about.  These produce perfectly tasty water and absolutely removes a ton of the chlorine and other “purification” elements from the water company.  I need to disagree with others, these work and the only downside is they’re not immediately filtering water - but that sort of demonstrates it’s a thorough process.  PUR products are definitely better than Brita, I’ve had mine for over three years and have been replacing only these.UPDATE: I now know what others are talking about.  Something happened with the quality of these.  I've ordered these in the past and I didn't have to wait days for water to be filtered.  Cannot recommend PUR's at this time, until they figure out how to get back to where they were with these filters.

  These don't look like the Pur filters I buy at the store. They didn't come in a box. They did not have the Pur decal on the exterior cover or on the filter, as shown in the picture. Filtering my water properly is very important to me so I am not going to use these, because I don't know how they were made and with what they filter. I noticed some of the reviews reported that the filters would get stuck and you would have to pound them on something. I have used Pur filters from a local store, and that has never happened to me before.

  I've been using the PUR Pitchers for years now, however this is the first time I bought this ""Lead Reduction"" replacement filter. Usually I would purchase the ""Basic"" replacement filter in the past, which I've probably have replaced at least 10 times. But I decided to buy the ""lead reduction"" replacement filter and this filter doesn't even TASTE like it filtered ANYTHING.This so-called ""filtered"" water is horrible, it taste like I'm drinking lead. I usually used the water from the pitcher to make food and coffee with daily and couldn't figure out why everything taste so different. Then I finally tired drinking the water by itself, once I ran out of bottled water (I know I need to stop buying bottled). I immediately realized that it wasn't bad vegetables or bad coffee grinds, it was the water from the ""lead reduction"" filter. I'm not sure if I will go back to the ""basic"" one with the blue cap, because now I'm questioning the ""PUR"" brand.

  We had used the standard PUR pitcher filters for about 25 years and jumped at the opportunity to try these new PUR Ultimate Lead Reduction Pitcher filters.  Although they continue to suffer from slow flow like the standard PUR pitcher filters, the water clearly tastes better.  I might not be a scientist with a lead tester to measure parts-per-million, but I have repeatedly been able to tell the difference between tap water, mineral water, and filtered water in blind taste tests.  These filters definitely make the water taste better than the standard ones.  Thanks PUR!

  I was unsure about these not being the traditional decorated curtain hook. I love these. They slide on the rod so smoothly and give it a very nice look. They don't draw your eye to them which is great because that is not their point. They keep the curtain in place and you don't have worry about the hook falling off the rod and hanging weird because they close. It was easy to install and they seem like a durable product. I am going to order another set for my other bathroom.

  well I got to admit I didn't order this to hold up a shower curtain, but to hold up a tarp on the side of a carport. Needed something I could slide open and close. Didn't want to spend a lot of money trying different ideas, so I went with these inexpensive hooks. So far working like a champ. I can only imagine if they are working for my application they would be great for there intended use.

  SO awesome!  Cannot believe I've struggled with the same, cheap plastic rings for all these years, getting caught and generally frustrating.  These are super smooth, and have no problem sliding right over the ridge where the rod extends, something the plastic ones never did.  And, I really like the sound of them sliding along.  I can't tell you why, but it's comforting.  Wouldn't be if I had to listen to it for hours, but as you just open or close the curtain, it's nice!  I went ahead bought them for my other 2 showers because I like them so much!

  THIS IS NOT AN AIR CONDITIONER! So many people are mad because its not cooling down their space like an a/c would. It is an evaporative cooler. The way it works is the same way sweat works when you sweat. A minimal amount of water is formed into a mist, which a fan blows across wet filter elements, and in turn gives a nice chilly breeze when its blowing on you. It wont work in your car, get your a/c fixed. It wont cool down a room of any size, get a a/c unit. What it will do it make a hot room feel more comfortable when your in it by giving you a cool breeze. I use it for my bedroom, blowing directly onto me, to keep me comfortable while sleeping. The a/c in the house doesnt make the upstairs cool, so this is the next option....the final option would be to get a a/c unit in my room. Works exactly the way its intended to.

  I bought mine at Walmart and just came on here to see what reviews said but tbh mine is great. Its obviously not going to fill a whole room or operate as well as an actual air conditioner might but If you keep air flow with in 5 feet of area you trying to cool down it works great. The air is already cool when you use it but if you want it really cold what I have done is soaked the filter for 5 to 10 min in water then freeze it, once frozen take it out run it under water very quickly one last time then put it in the Artic. Also instead of adding water only to the tank add crushed ice. This gets it really cold and you actually would think its AC if it were bigger. I will always add crushed ice it's best way to do it in my opinion.  You can also add some essential oil to filter heads if you want added bonus of great calming smell....add mint and the air actually feels even colder. It's not too loud either you definately can hear it but no more than a normal fan and after a while it just becomes white noise. My only con would be the night light. I was kinda hoping it was brighter and led looking like the last version of this product which I never owned but have seen other people use. This light is in the water tank so it's not nearly as bright but good enough if your not looking for an actual lamp like light but just some small luminous appeal.

  Works as intended. Won’t allow anyone to get into my apartment (I’ve been having some random people try to open my door lately. Not sure they just accidentally went to the wrong door or if they were seeing if my apartment was unlocked). One star off only because it’s a little loose and shakes around, even when in place on the door, and also because it scratches up the paint aroundthe door when putting it on.

  We took this device anytime we were staying at a hotel (Foxwood's) or an AirB&B we rented. It is easy to figure out how to set it on the door striker.  You can download a video for directions. It has 2 sizes you can choose depending on the size of your striker. This is great for added security while for you at home or traveling. Our granddaughter uses it if she is home alone after school. When you go to a hotel, a lot of people have access to your room like the housekeeper or maintenance workers. You just attach this to the door while you are in the room for extra protection.These are very inexpensive and we have given them out as gifts to family and friends. We highly recommend this product!

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"OXO Good Grips Silicone Drain Protector for Pop-Up & Regular Drains, Grey, One Size",$9.99,4.0,"
  I am not a frequent rater, but I spent some time with the two most popular drain covers for pop-up drains (OXO and Lekeye) and I wanted to share what I learned. The bottom line: neither is perfect, but I'm going to stick with the OXO.What I am looking for:--works with a pop-up drain (photo), TIE--stays put when showering, TIE--catches my hair (long straight caucasian hair), Lekeye wins by a little--allows water flow, Lekeye wins until there is a hair buildup (see details)--easy to clean, OXO wins by a landslideLonger version:I first bought the OXO for my new shower that I wanted to protect from hair clogs. I liked it, but every time I showered, there would be soapy water left standing at the end. This is because my hair would start to clog the bottom holes, and THERE ARE NO HOLES ON THE BASE (photo). I got into the habit of cleaning it off and then giving the shower a quick cold-water rinse, EVERY TIME I showered. It was fine, but I thought I could do better.So I bought the Lekeye because I could see that there are a lot more holes on the bottom part of the cover. Because of that, it does drain better than the OXO, especially at first. The issue is that the base is covered in little nubs (photo) to catch the hairs. And it does a great job of it! The problem is, I find it hard to get the hair off of the nubs. So I kept my habit of cleaning every time, but each day a little more hair would remain on the cover. So now, it no longer drains that well and is kind of gross after a few days of use.Bottom line: if you are concerned about your hair slipping through, the Lekeye is a more ""sticky"" cover. My hair is not particularly thick, though, and the OXO catches a ton of hair. I'm not concerned that much is getting through. But in the end, given that I need to clean both regularly, I'm going with OXO which is a quick wipe and then done. I still can't get the hair off the Lekeye to pass it on.

  Unless you have regular occasion to de-tar and feather yourself, or exfoliate a layer of gravel, this does nothing to trap my everyday sheddings.  Perhaps very curly hair would get trapped, but my family's straight hair goes right through the holes.  I've included an icky picture as proof.

  After tossing away quite a few cheap-o drain protectors that became dingy over time no matter how I soaked and scrubbed them, I decided to splurge on this OXO silicone drain protector.  I've been very impressed!  It's tall enough to fit easily over my pop-up drain and (even without suction cups) the weighted top keeps it in place -- even with my faucet running almost directly on it [see photo - my water pressure is quite decent but your mileage may vary!].  I have medium-length hair and seem to shed almost as much as my cat, but the drain protector catches it all and is easily removed and tossed away.  Best of all, in my case, the silicone hasn't held onto mildew or mold -- I have been able to spray and wipe away any grime with very little effort.  It looks like this drain protector will last a very long time.  This has been a very worthy purchase for the few dollars more!

  Perfect for the bath to catch my long hair and my pet’s fur. It fits nicely over my popped up plug and you can push down on the cover to start/stop the drain as well since it’s flexible rubber.  My water does drain a little slower, but that’s fine. It also stays in place and does not slide round or lift up.

  It took me way too long to find this product - I'd never had pop up style trains before and it took me a lot of trial and error to find a drain protector that would fit.My partner and I both have longish hair and despite the fact that we do our best to contain/collect what sheds in the shower our current apartment's shower drain would get plugged every 2-4 weeks.  It was always because of hair and while not difficult to remedy, it was always supremely disgusting to clean out.We'd never had this many issues but we'd also never had this style of drain before.  I'm not a fan.  The 'pop up' part was always closing itself mid shower so we took it out leaving the drain fully exposed. We spent a lot of time trying to find a cover that was a) functional and b) fit...  I had given up when this popped up on my ""recommended for you"" list.  Thanks Amazon.We've only had this for about two weeks but I'm a huge fan.  As others have said, it stays in place, catches an unseemly amount of hair (despite us both continuing to catch what we can) and is easy to clean.  My one complaint is that the lip around the edge does cause a slight drainage backup, but it's minor compared to the ankle deep water we'd get when the drain was clogged AGAIN.I clean off any hair right after I shower - this prevents the hair from getting crusted on (gross) and any remaining water to drain out (which keeps the tub clean longer)

  I was going to just get a command hook but found these. They are perfect for the pool skimmer and outside broom. I stuck them to the side of my house (painted plywood on a very old addition on our house) and so far have had no issues with them being outside. It’s been a few months now.Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option.

  These are great for brooms, mops, sweepers but they also make great toothbrush holders.  I have been searching fruitlessly for a Sonicare toothbrush wall mount.  Then I saw a slideshow of neat things to do with command strip hooks and got this idea.

  So I decided to use these for a slightly different use than intended for. They work great for holding my hair products. The rubber in the middle is a great non-slip material. They hold well and I’m super happy this worked.

  Perfect solution for stowing your broom in your travel trailer.  I was able to mount it so that I could easily access the broom from inside or outside my trailer. The gray rubber gripper securely holds the broom in place while traveling and with a gentle pull the broom handle releases.

  I've been using these for a few years, and I just picked up some more because I liked them so much. One thing to be aware of - since these gripper hooks sit right up against the wall, they work best for things that are flat and don't stick out too much. For example, if you have a mop with a large bulky head, it may not work as well as a broom that's more flat. I am able to use it for my Rubbermaid Reveal mop, but it requires a bit of manipulating to get it to hang properly. But otherwise, they feel very secure on the wall, and I am very happy with them!

  I was using regular command hooks on the back of my basement door to hold my broom, mop, swiffer, etc. Every time I opened the door they swung all over the place, sometimes falling off (they have strange handles). I found these and WOW! What a difference. Highly recommend. Items stay in place, easy to remove for use and replacing is a breeze, too. What did we do before command hooks???Hint. If using on the back of a door, place the command holder somewhat toward the middle of the handle instead of at the top. This will help prevent swinging when you open and close the door.  I haven't had an issue with items sliding but if I do I'll wrap a rubber band around the handle.

  I ordered one of these broom grippers to hold my kitchen broom off the floor (to keep the bristles in better shape) and hung up on the back of the closet door.  Been a couple of months now and it works well, so I ordered two more.  I did clean/dry the surface well before adhering the strip to the closet door and waited 24 hours before hanging the broom up (in the gripper).  I used one to grip my cane upright and keep it from falling on the floor when I am working at my desk.  Worked so well I put another gripper for my cane on my nightstand too.  I have arthritic hands so I had to practice using the gripper effectively (roll the handle in and out rather than jamming it in) to allow me to use it easily (without hand/wrist pain).I tried to use one to hang up my aluminum snow shovel but the diameter of the handle was too big for the gripper unfortunately.  Shovel might have been too heavy too?  Specs say: will hold up to 4 lbs and 0.8-1.0"" handles.  Not sure what a 0.8-1.0"" handle is.  My cane measures 3.5"" around and weighs a little more than 1 lb.  The kitchen broom handle measures 2.85"" around (OD?) and weighs about a pound too.

  I’m a lifelong Brita user so I was thrilled to see they finally made a countertop filter that catches lead!  I followed the set-up instructions precisely and at first everything seemed fine.  The water filtered a little more slowly than the regular Brita filters, but no big deal, and it tasted great.  However, within 2-3 weeks, each filter in this two-pack slowed to a CRAWL, barely filtering a single batch of water in 8 hours (!).  I then looked up the official Brita instructions for unclogging these filters and followed those to a “t.”  That didn’t help one bit.  Shortly after trying to fix each of the two filters, black flecks flooded out of them (see first photo).Now, the box specifically advertises “no black flecks” (see second photo) and “lasts 3x longer than standard Brita filters” so to have two of these filters last at most 3 weeks each and then vomit black flecks – this is either a defective product or false advertising.  I see on here a lot of people have complained about similar problems and Brita just offers coupons for money off your next purchase.  That’s ridiculous.  Refund or replace, Brita!

  I can't believe I purchased these filters without first reading the negative reviews.  The negative reviews are TRUE.  I installed the first filter on July 18, 2018 and could not believe how long it took to empty the reservoir.  Then, on August 1, 2018 it STOPPED WORKING.  This is 2 weeks for a filter that is advertised as being good for 6 months.  Also, the taste of the filtered water is not as good as I expected it to be.  Bottled water is better.  After being a long time Britta user I am looking for a new filter system.  With all the bad reviews it seems like either Britta or Amazon no longer care about their product or their customers.  Maybe Mr. Bezos is more concerned with his space efforts than his company.September 1, 2018FOLLOW UP REVIEWFollowing my critical review I was contacted by Britta and given a telphone number and a reference number.I called the number and was given the option of a refund or receive a replacement 2 pack of Longlast filters.  Since I have had a long and satisfactory relationship with Britta I chose the replacement option.  BIG MISTAKE!! The replacement filters were as defective as those I received originally.  The first filter was installed on August 17, 2018.  By August 30 it was taking 6 to 8 hours for the reservoir to empty through the filter.  AND there is now a blotchy, streaky substance on the interior of the white reservoir.When I initially called Britta I was told that about 10% of their filters from an un-named manufacturer were defective.  What are the odds that I would get the defective ones a second time?BUYER BEWARE!!

  We purchased a Brita carafe water pitcher to filter our NYC tap water. I was very attracted to the idea of a long-lasting filter that would not only remove more contaminants than the basic white Brita filter, but also last much longer. We bought these Brita brand filters thinking that their much higher price would be offset by lasting much longer than the white ones. Wrong. They may be removing more stuff from the water but they clogged up way before the expected number of gallons suggested by Brita's literature. For the first few weeks of use, water flowed quickly. Then the flow slowed down and now you need to wait patiently for the filter to do its thing. End result: more expensive way to get filtered water than the basic white Brita filter. Can't comment on removal of the contaminants. The taste of the water was not noticeably different.

  These ""longlasting"" filters are not longlasting at all. Ours became unusable after like two months: It was so slow that it took hours to fill up the water pitcher.Brita's customer services gives you all kinds of useless tips to mitigate this problem. You are supposed to put them in water, rinse them, squeeze them etc. Nothing works. Just search for ""brita longlast filter slow"" and see for yourself. You will find a lot of angry comments on Brita's website as well. We will keep our Brita water pitcher, but we will definitely never waste our money on these again.

  Total junk! Takes over a day to drain once.  Unacceptable!I can't even believe this product still exists.  If I could have, I would have given NO STARS.  It was slow to begin with and only got slower and slower.  We go through about 4 fills per day(about 2 gallons) in our house(with the regular filters).  This filter was always slower and would take over an hour to drain one time, even when it was new.  But after a month or two, it began to take multiple hours to drain once. Now, I realized that I can fill it at night and then in the morning, it's drained less than half way.

  I have been using Brita filters for years. At first this filter, which is shorter than the latest filters for full-size pitchers, didn't seem to fit: The filter has only 1 groove and did not fit the cross frame of the pitcher, and didn't even seem to go down all the way to the frame. I almost wrote an angry email, then I tried 1 last time to insert the Longlast filter, TWIST AND TURN AT the same time WHILE PUSHING DOWN and the single groove of the filter did catch 1 part of the cross frame of the pitcher and lock in place. It is tightly sealed, although you can see that 3/4 of the bottom of the filter is not touching the cross frame. Fitration is slow but good and the seal is good. I bought this filter because of the multiple failures in lead contamination testing in schools around the good old city of San Diego. I will not go back to any filter that doesn't take care of lead. I took out 2 stars for the stupid design. Some people in the RnD department at Brita need to go back to school to learn the basics of ergonomics and customer satisfaction. They must have been on their phones checking Facebook and Instagram in class and taking selfies during the lectures.

  Good item, but plastic casings come off easily and magnets can fall out. This can be frustrating. Solution...when you first get this, spread it out on the floor with enough distance between plastic casings to prevent them from being attracted to each other. Try to remove the plastic casings. If a casing is easily removed/pops out easily, use transparent gorilla glue, snap it back together, and wait a few hours for the glue to set. After the glue sets, go ahead and install on your doorway.

  ok - here's the thing. it works and the magnets close and all of that is awesome, however they include nails with it as suggestions, but you actually need to use them. So don't think that you can just tape it up and it stays - it will for a day maybe, but then you will need to use the nails. But it works - the mosquitos and flies are staying out of the house! Do yourself a favor also and measure from the floor up, so that none of it is dragging on the floor on when you apply it -

  The product quality is really poor. Second day using it, one of the magnets fell off. Some of the thread is coming off. Really really cheap made. I bought this brand (called Homitt Magnetic Screen Door) last year and it was a lot better product.

  Bought this less than one month ago and set up about 2 weeks ago. It was simple to set up but within a few hours two magnets fell off and the tape was no longer sticking to the door frame. The magnets containers are on the opposite sides ...and clamped together through the lining. When one walks through the door some of the magnet containers on the bottom of the mesh would come apart and fall to the floor. The bottom of the mesh got caught on something which caused a small hole. The previous mesh magnet door we had lasted for almost a year before showing signs of wear and tear; those magnets were sewn into the mesh door lining. Save your money, do your research,  and opt for something more durable.

  This mesh door went up very easily with the velcro strips. FYI, even though you might want to mount it so that it is taut, it closes better with just a bit of slack across the door. We did find it useful to add a couple extra velcro mounts. I thought it would be removable and while it would be easy to do, it does leave those velcro strips visible on the frame when not in use. If I were doing it again, I'd try to find white velcro strips to match the woodwork around the door. All this slightly negative things aside, I love the door and no longer worry about birds flying in when I leave the door open to allow air into the apartment. Flying insects have a less welcoming opening to visit as well. It is sturdy and as described. I would buy again.

  It says new and improved on the box but it's still the same old cr*p.  I had the screen up about 2 minutes, still affixing the sides and a magnet popped out of one of the middle plastic holders.  About 3 hours later another one of those plastic magnet holders was coming unsnapped and another magnet was working it's way out. They don't send enough velco, but that's the least of this product's problems. When it's assembled it leaves gaps in-between the Velcro closures and in the center between the magnets where tons of bugs can get in.  There also isn't enough weight on the bottom to keep it flush against the door frame so bugs can come in there too. Which really leaves no use for this product. And it isn't cheap! I decided instead of wasting more money on a replacement I'm just going to hire a handyman to install a screen that actually works.

  I ordered this because my children can't seem to figure out how to close the sliding door. I have four kids, and now that it is summer there is a pretty constant rotation coming in and out. This seemed like a possible fix to the issue, as it would keep the bugs out but make it possible for the kids to come and go without me needing to constantly remind them to shut the door.Functionally, this has been great so far for our family! It allows the kids and the dog to walk through easily, then the magnets ensure that it closes automatically. Installation was really simple, and the directions included are very clear. I removed the screen door from the sliding door and installed this on the outside of the door, and it is the perfect width and length. Between the magnets there are small gaps, but none big enough that we have had any bugs come in yet. It definitely simplifies summer play and removes my concerns about a gaping door,The only thing I haven't been thrilled with is that the mesh stitching is frayed in the center (where the magnets are located) making a constant supply of loose strings in the center of the door. I have been able to just pull them off without it seeming to detract from the effectiveness of the screen, but it causes a lot of drama when everyone thinks they have a spiderweb on their shoulder after walking through the door! Eventually I anticipate the door losing enough threads that it will start to cause issues with the structural integrity, but so far that hasn't been a problem and I have seven kids (my own and their friends), myself, and a dog that are using it constantly.

  Absolutely loved it. It was easy to put up. It's only been up like 4 hours and one of the magnets fell off. Not sure how long this is going to last. Great concept thoUpdate 24 hours later... 2 more magnets have fallen off. Time to return it and buy a better quality one.

  If chloramine (chlorine and ammonia) is used to disinfect your water supply, this filter will clog in a couple weeks according to the manufacturer. I was only told this because I noticed a defect in the casing and then they informed me. How many people purchased this based on their claims, and then threw it away once they lost water pressure, thinking only what the listing said, which is the life of filter will vary by how much chlorine you have. There is no mention Chloramine will significantly reduce the life of this filter and cause water pressure to be slowed down considerably.

  EDITED REVIEW: I only had a good experience with the first purchase. Subsequent purchases of filter replacements have not worked as well as the first one. The 3rd one I ordered only gave me a few days to a week of improved water. I’m not sure what the issue is, but I have since moved on to other brands.We moved from the country where we had a water softener to the city, where the water is both hard and heavily chlorinated. After three years, having super dry hair and itchy skin has become the new normal. My curly hair actually has straightened a lot and started falling out. I am also always breaking out in acne. After doing some research, I started to think maybe it was our water causing the problem. I noticed with our water that my hair instantly felt dry and gummy when the water hit it, even before using shampoo. Washing and conditioning never made it feel clean or soft, and it was always stringy and flat at the crown. My husband installed a $15 shower head filter from Menards, which we were using for awhile, but I wasn't impressed. On a whim, I thought I'd try the Aqua Bliss to see if it made any difference, or if I had to just give up and get used to gross hair and skin.And WOW!! The Aqua Bliss is awesome! I could tell a difference immediately! I don't remember when the last time was that my hair didn't feel like a bale of hay in the shower, even after conditioner. I'm not exaggerating one little bit. It's been awful. But one shower with the Aqua Bliss and my hair feels clean and soft, and has volume now. My skin doesn't feel stripped and itchy. I also didn't need to use anywhere near as much shower gel or shampoo. Amazing! I can't wait to see the improvements over time and if my acne goes away also. At this point, I'm converted, and will definitely repurchase!

  I love EVERYTHING about this company and their products! They give you exactly what they promise... a quality product and easy to understand directions.I just finished putting the filter on our showerhead. Earlier today I re-read the reviews and followed their directions. It was easy. No leaks.Earlier today I took the hose off the three way shower arm diverter. I soaked the shower arm diverter and the showerhead in undiluted vinegar all day. I cleaned up the threads on everything whether they needed it or not. I also soaked the washers and cute little screen things ...so they wouldn't feel left out.I almost forgot to put it all back together and add the filter!  I woke up, couldn't sleep and remembered ....So, even though I'm half awake, I just put it all together:1. The filter went on the extender2.The three way diverter is on the other end of filter3.The showerhead is attached to the three way diverter4. The hose is attached to the three way diverter.5. The handheld shower sprayer (also their product that I just received and love) is attached to the hose.I did this all in less than 10 minutes. NO LEAKS! I did not have to use any of the free tape they so thoughtfully provide.OH! I did not use any tools  .. not a one. I tightened everything by hand.I did take a shower to test the new filter. Yes, the water DOES feel different and my hair feels like silk. I did not need any lotion after my shower... plus, I am too tired to apply it anyhow.I'm going back to sleep now. I know my husband will enjoy his shower in an hour. No, I'm not Tom...  I am his wife.Buy this filter. I read a million reviews. My homework paid off.

  So I decided to test the before and after with a water tester.  The results were 262 ppm for water without the filter, and 249ppm for water with the filter.  No significant difference.  Still had chlorine in it, fluoride, and hard water.  I re-did the test to confirm.  Then I tested distilled water and got 0ppm, so the water tester was accurate.  In the end this shower filter literally doesn't do anything.

  I live in an area where they pump the water from a river with alot of farming in the catchment, its also volcanic soils & in summer gets salt water encroachment. So not ideal - it basically tastes and smells like a muddy puddle full of chlorine! After doing a bit of research as to why my hair felt so dry yet oil after washing, i decided the water may be playing a part. So i ordered the 12 stage water filter to try. One word - Amazing! I could actually feel a difference when showering, the water almost felt softer if possible & the chlorine smell was gone. After showering my skin didn't have that tight feeling, and my hair felt much softer. Greatly recommended!! FYI to fit our handheld shower, we just got a male/female hose extention from plumbing shop, so super easy install :-)

  I got this because we have an iron/scale problem when it comes to our hot water. we've been using this for a few weeks and I think that is fixed. My wife dyes her hair and its important to her that she has clean water and seems to do the trick. I can't comment on if the chlorine is removed or not because we have none in out well water.Our feels very lush now and we don't get that almost dry sticky feeling from hard water, nor do we get that super slipper feeling we got from water softeners. Its a great middle ground and make the water look, smell, and feel like nice old spring water. For the price, you're going be hard stretched to find anything comparable and doubt you'll find anything better. excellent product, and the owners are excellent people. they provide plenty of help if needed and customer service is a top priority. A++ from me!

  These were cute and worked as expected, however after about a week they started developing rust in many of the lights. They have not stopped working but after taking them down, I can see almost all of the lights are rusted. I was hoping to use them again next year but do not think it is a good idea to put them outside.The package says indoor/outdoor use but also says the plug must be kept indoors. Okkkkk... Then the safety instructions in the box say don’t close a door or window on the cord or extension cord you’re using to plug it in. So in reality these are only outdoor use if you can plug them inside and leave a door or window open while in operation. For a party or something it might work, but it’s more than a bit disingenuous to say these are waterproof, outdoor seasonal lights.It’s also being advertised hanging with curtains but the safety instructions explicitly say don’t do that. This is a cheap string of lights that might work just fine for you but buyer beware- the advertising on this listing is extremely misleading.

I just can't believe the time and money I wasted on these.

  I ordered four boxes of these for a wedding reception. The lights work fine. However, all four boxes had shards of glass in them upon opening. At first, I thought some of the bulbs had broken during shipping. Upon closer look, I realized the shards were much larger than the size of the bulbs, so I have no idea where they came from. As we pulled the lights out of the box, glass started falling everywhere onto the floor. This is so dangerous and I have no idea how this product could have passed any type of quality assurance test.

   These are so stunning I may just leave them up all year! I bought 3 strands and would honestly buy more if i needed them. I tested the waterproofing and they are definitely waterproof! I love all the different settings and the way they make my patio look. Just a heads up; do NOT take The twist ties off before you hang them up. I made the mistake of taking all the ties off and then had to untangle them for about half an hour lolBoth my mom and sister asked where I bought these lights so YES I would definitely refer these to others. You won’t be disappointed.

  DUDS!!!! Dang we are so disappointed! My son got these for his birthday and had to clean his room in order for me to help him hang them (incentive), well he put them under his bed in the box for awhile and by the time he finally got his room clean, we hung them and realized they don’t even work. So disappointed. As you can see they are still rolled up in the original way. Advice would be to test upon arrival and then don’t get your hopes up that they’ll last long.

  1- the width of this curtain is NOT 9 ft long, at least not the part with the actual lights.2- part of the cable is black rather than transparent so it’s an eyesore3- the “changing” part of the control doesn’t change anything so the lights are just stuck on flickering mode.This as my second set of these as the first arrived with only every other light working.

  When I received these lights, I had to untangle them. Most of it was not twist tied like the instructions say they should be. When plugging them in and turning them on, none of the lights turned on. There was also a whole other section of the lights that did not connect to the section with a plug. There are two ends that looked like they had been cut. (Photo attached) I wonder if someone had sent these back before and they just re-shipped it to someone else. I hope that is not the case. Luckily, I opened these within the return window. Such a disappointment though, I was super excited for these. :(

  This is the WORST dish soap we've ever purchased!  We usually use dish soap for cleaning one-off dishes we need right away or oversized items which don't easily fit in the dishwasher.  So instead of filling the sink with water and adding soap we'll wet a dish, put a drop of soap on it, suds, scrub and rinse.  The problem is this soap doesn't rinse off easily -- we've cleaned a large pot, rinsed for several minutes until we thought we had all the soap off it, made a large batch of pasta and when we rinsed the pasta, presto - suds reappeared in our pot of pasta!  We've had this happen several other times - make a bottle of milk for our baby, rinse several times and then go to add warm water and suds re-appear in the bottle!  While this product promises more suds for longer, it needs to rinse off dishes easier.

  We first saw that the bottles had been opened and retaped shut (which looked shady to begin with). We also noticed that the consistency of the soap looked really watery and it also looks like there's like 10% less soap in the bottle as usual (we buy the same soap/bottle size from the grocery store usually). We figure that the bottle probably has about 50-75% of the amount of soap as usual and then the rest is water to make the bottle look more full.That being said, still gave 3 stars because $12 for 4 bottles of soap is a legit steal

  I've  been cleaning dishes in some shape, form, or fashion now for almost 40 years.First: The likelihood that this item comes damaged to your home is relatively high. It will ship with other items that are potentially persihable, especially if you use subscribe & save.My wife shifted to using what could be salavaged from this soap instead of tossing it (we had to transfer it to a different container) and now, after every use, anything that it is used to clean transfers the taste of soap. A tumbler for coffee that I normally take to work tastes like I'm drinking soap. We've attempted to just rinse the tumbler multiple times and it still continues to add soapy flavor to any new drink added.Refrain from using on pots, pans, or bowls that you might use to cook or bake with. For St. Patrick's Day we made scones -- and despite properly cleaning the bowls and removing any and all residue -- the scones taste like giant bars of soap.The scent is generally unpleasant and permiates throughout your home or building when you use it. We do not live in a small space, but it can be noticed that dishes are soaking whenever this soap is used anywhere in the home.Just bleh.

  The dish washing detergent is fine. We've used it for years. On the other hand, Amazon's job of packaging the bottles was poor. The box arrived soaked in detergent, and one of the bottles was nearly empty because the flip cap was open. Packages are always jostled about in transit - this is unavoidable. It is Amazon's job to package containers holding liquids so that the contents is secure and padded. You can't just throw things into a box and hope for the best.

  ...due to all the phenomenal reviews all over the web, but mine are mixed. I have used many hoses over the years, so feel I have a bit of arm-chair knowledge. First, it is not totally a kink-free hose. It will kink at times just like a ""regular"" hose, but can easily be snapped out by a quick jerk. Not something you can easily do with a ""standard"" hose, but it does kink and cut the water off, for sure. Second, the description says it ""lays flat"" when not filled with water. Not true, it clearly doesn't. This wasn't a reason I purchased it, but clearly not as advertised. Third, it coils much harder then a ""standard"" hose. What I learned is that it needs to fully drained of water first, otherwise, it just creates a twisting effect that makes coiling it impossible. In fact, if it has these twists in it, the coil just ""figure-8's"" itself with you pick it up. I rarely, if ever, have that issue with a ""regular"" hose. All-in-all, mixed feelings I would say. If I purchased this without ever seeing a review, I might have given it 4 stars, but the internet hype is crazy, making it sound like it is a drastic hose revolution.

  I HATE this hose.  How this hose has any good reviews is simply beyond my comprehension.  I needed a long hose to reach the back of my yard where I have a pond.  This looked like a great idea for a lightweight flexible hose.  The only problem is this thing, once coiled up, is almost impossible to extend out without an extended wrestling match.  I kid you not, you will feel like you're wrestling a giant snake as you try to get the kinks out of this hose.  Unless you twist the hose as you unroll it, it will hold the loops and then kink at regular intervals.  This is an especially painful process with a 75' hose.  It has a nice feel to it, weighs almost nothing, but in my opinion is completely unusable if you plan of storing it coiled up in a holder/container of some sort.  I would only recommend if you plan on leaving it unrolled in your yard.

  I cannot tell you how much I HATE this hose. I saw the high rating and liked the color... it's a near match for the color of our front door. I'll pull the hose off the rack and walk around the house dropping it as I go. Part way to my destination the hose is spun up in a knot. I need to start unwinding it to get the kinks out. When I bring it back to wind it up on the rack it's the same thing... I spend more time unraveling this damn hose than using it to water! It's incredibly frustrating and I don't understand the high reviews.

  This is one of the worst hoses I've ever bought.  When you are trying to use it, it kinks and knots itself up and is a genuine pain in the butt.  Forget trying to coil it neatly.  Or at all.  If you have two people, one untwisting while the other coils, it's possible.  Otherwise it's totally impossible.  And when it is coiled nearly by two people, it rewards you by knotting up every few feet when you go to use it again.At least people walking down the dock get a laugh as they watch me fighting the damn thing.

  The first one had several kinks on arrival which seem like they are permanent, so I returned.  The second one was perfect, so we'll see how it holds up.  As of now, the hose seems good.  The only recommendation for user is to unwind completely before reeling/coiling back.  Annoying to do but necessary to reel/coil without inducing major kinks and twists in the hose.

   Method 1, the so called ""easy"" method did not work for any of my plugs.  It just would never recognize them.  So, I put them plug into AP mode, and it worked like a charm.  AP mode was pretty easy to use using the Smart Life app and I had no troubles.You have to create a  Smart Life account when you first install the app which is easy to do.  I have four plugs controlling Christmas lights around the house.  I created a group in the Smart Life app and put a timer on the group so that all my Christmas lights turn on at 4:30 and turn off at 10:30.  Very simple using the Smart Life app.I then enabled the Smart Life skill using my Alexa app and connected Alexa to my Smart Life account, so i can turn them on with voice commands also.  Alexa does not recognize the group name though.  She only sees the individual devices  So devices must be turned on one at a time using voice commands.  That's fine for now, because the only one I use voice commands for is the Christmas tree.  I was debating giving it four stars instead of five because the ""easy"" method didn't work and I had to use AP mode.  But, AP mode was pretty easy, and I do love that I can control everything with  Alexa, and the price was really good also.  So, I ended up with 5 stars.  Let's hope they last!

  Had no trouble connecting all four plugs to my wifi, then easily connected to my Alexa app. Great little gadgets for turning lights and fans on and off from another room. I've made groupings for lights and simmer pots, too. Important to understand that these plugs CAN NOT turn on a smart TV or other device which uses an infrared remote, but can turn them off. They turn off the electric current to the device, which means it has to be permanently ""turned on"" via a physical on/off button or switch. Unfortunately, this is not explained anywhere that I've seen.

  I like home automation things, but some of them just too expensive. These however, are an excellent product for a very reasonable price! I like that they use the Smart Life App and integrate into Alexa very easily. The size is nice too, doesn't take up a bunch of space or block the other outlet. I would like to see these made with a side or top plug for use behind dressers, where space is limited.

  AMAZING! Set up was a breeze. I originally bought the Amazon Smart Plug and that was a joke. It would set up successfully then disconnect 30 min later. Anyway, these set up wayyyy too easily. I use them for all my downstairs lights. It was so simple getting them set up in the SmartLife app and then amazon automatically detected every plug once I enabled the smartlife skill!

  This 12 pack set of LED Fairy Lights have really impressed me. I do a lot of crafts using lights like these, but I usually get them from a different site. I thought using the other site, but I was so wrong. Not only are these lights I purchased here on Amazon less expensive, but they are also a much better quality of lights. They do arrive in a nice box with batteries included as well as a little screwdriver to get to the battery compartment. They each have the plastic to keep the batteries from draining before you are ready to use them. These fairy lights put it a beautiful warm lighting that adds the perfect touch to any project. These would be great for wedding decorations as well. I will be buying more for my next round of craft projects and you should too!

  Some of the other reviews mentioned lights not working...I found a few however they all eventually worked. There were 2 lights where the little plastic battery cover was pushed back far and I had to open the device to access it and 1 required a little ""whack"" (like you do when the tv remote won't work). All and all, these lights are an incredible value, the brightness worked perfectly in a glass vase with water and colored beads. The lights are waterproof, but the battery pack is not (although, I accidentally dropped the whole thing in water,  they still worked fine). I will definitely purchase again should fairy lights be needed.

  These tiny fairy lights are subtle in small quantities. The tree on the left only has 3 strands. It looks elegant, unlike the other one which looks playful.

  I bought these so I could put them around my gaming setup, but I'm still waiting on my desk but I had to break one of them out and do something with it so I put it along my closet curtain. They're neatly packaged, and also come with the tiniest screwdriver I've ever seen as well as 3 extra battery replacements. Each string of lights comes with a battery already installed and the wire is wrapped up in a fairly organized way.Be careful undoing the loops on the lights, it's not just a few twists this way and a twist that way. The wires have two sides to them and in between them are the bulbs, and they've fed the wire between itself around in a couple different ways. Not hard to undo at all, just note that you can't twist it off like a bread tie and stretch it out. Take your time.My only gripe is along the start of the wire there's such a big gap where there are no lights. I didn't realize this at first as you can see in my 4th picture, I'd already fed them down through my curtain hanger and taped it to the wall to keep it still and realized there were no lights for a good 7 inches or so, so I had to redo it and wrap it up and tuck away behind the switch. Although, this is a good thing in a way because it gives you plenty of room to tuck the switch and battery pack away out of sight.Some of the lights do seem a little more ""cold"" than others. I ordered warm lights, but a few of them still seem to be a little more on the whiter side than the yellowish tint, but I don't really mind it. The wire is easy to bend and holds its shape, and is easy to straighten back out again if you need to adjust or move it.Overall great lights, and I'll probably be ordering more of them.

  This came packed SO WELL!!! And with extra batteries!!! Here's some advice and addressing any bad reviews:1) It comes with a tab so the battery isn't drained. KEEP THE TABS!2) Be patient unraveling the strings. Pay attention!! If you look and take them apart carefully, it will be so much better!!3) I placed these on my stairway garland. It looks AMAZING!!!4) When placing them, use the starting point with NO remote...string along...then start the NEXT strand with the remote so that 2 are close together. This helps so you aren't hunting to turn them on.5) Sit back and look at how pretty they look!Don't be a Grinch and blame other factors. It was packaged perfectly with NO breakage. Every light was strong.

  I adore these and would recommend them. With that said, there are a few things to note.One of mine didn't work straight out of the package. They were packaged well and so I believe this was wired incorrectly.The lights dim before they go out. You'd think this was helpful but you can see some dim and others are still bright. So, if you are putting them in a display with more than one strand you might have to replace them all when one goes. You can see this in my photo.Replacing the batteries is a bit of a pain. The package comes with the cutest little screwdriver. Think doll cute. Actually, it is great if your child has an 18"" doll. Thankfully I had a slightly larger screw driver in the house. The screws are equally tiny and I now have a few hiding in my house as I dropped them and could not find them. (I don't have kids nor pets so this isn't a problem. I simply gave up trying to put the screws back in after changing the batteries and used clear tape to hold the new batteries in place once I put the cover back on.Still, worth the price. My batteries only lasted maybe 5 or 6 nights of being used about 4-6 hours. Next year I will time this better so I am not replacing batteries right before Christmas. But, they are great for places that don't have outlets. I hope this helps :)Oh- It does come with extra batteries. I actually upgraded to a higher priced battery in hopes of it staying on a bit longer.

  If you're looking at this review then you probably have a nice vacuum.  You're probably wondering, how do I replace these bags?  You're probably looking at these bags and thinking, man these are kind of expensive for.. well..  bags.  You would be right. These are kind of really expensive.  These bags are fine bags, they do everything they need to, but they're also really really expensive.  Sure they come with air filters too, but you're not going to go through the air filters fast enough to need to replace them with each bag.  Just kind of feels wasteful.So now you're probably wondering, but what choice do I have?  I have this nice vacuum, they kind of have me don't they?  No they do not.  Generics exist that sell bags that will work in your vacuum for a mere fraction of the price.  A simple amazon search will even bring you to some of these generic and it turns out they work just as well.  Having tried these official bags and the generics I can say, these bags are over priced and the premium does not result in any added benefit.Save yourself money and buy the generics.

  These bags are not made for the US market, they are made for European markets, they are made by Miele but they have a different internal baffling system than bags made for the US market.  They will work in US vacuums but perhaps not as efficiently,  Miele recommends using the correct bags for US made machines.  The description is misleading and should state these bags are not made for the USA market.

  I've owned a Miele for a few years, and while it sounds crazy to sing the praises of a vacuum cleaner, I must.  I originally got it because I was sick of the jet-engine, ear-piercing sound of cheaper canister vacs - I love how quiet it is.  Over the years I am continually amazed at how stuffed the bag can get with no reduction in suction - believe it or not (because I've never had the bag-change warning light go off either), I get reminded to change the bag because I sense the vacuum is heavier than normal !  When I do, the bag is always so stuffed it is hard to remove - yet it can be removed without emitting any dust or debris,or tearing, like paper bags. AND, as I said, it still has great suction in such a state.All in all, just a fantastic piece of engineering - albeit a pricey one.I bought a Miele dishwasher because I was so impressed with the vacuum, and that has been a joy as well.  Essentially silent, and cleans everything much better than its predecessors - I never even knew how much cleaner and spot-free things could be (I'm in NYC with great water supply - no need to use its built-in salt water softening feature).  And it's an 18"" model, to fit my apartment.  Holds an amazing amount.

  I didn’t buy these for my vacuum. I don’t even have a vacuum that takes bags. BUT I bought them to cut up and use for  filters for my corona virus masks.

  A lot of people have complained that they received the other (the ""Hyclean"" European version) bags, so I was a little worried about getting the wrong product (""Airclean is the proper American version).  However, they came exactly as advertised and they fit my C1 Limited Edition vacuum perfectly.  They are of better quality than the 3rd party bags I had been using, so I'm very happy with my purchase.

  Just ordered these for our C3 Complete model. They are identical to the one that came with the model. Perfect fit and original. I have also shown the filter that came with it ( you have to cut it to the correct size for your model) but ours looks clean as shown in the picture so I didn’t change it. Also seems to have another filter that our model doesn’t use. I have also taken a picture of ours HEPA filter ( not included in this package) that is also very clean, a testament to how well the original bag (and this replacement by definition) work at capturing the dust and small dust/dirt particles.

  These are great bags. Yes, the box is redesigned. Yes, the bags are slightly redesigned. Same performance. They may be expensive, but half the reason I have a Miele is for the filtration and bagging system. If you are simply restocking, these are the same as the ""other"" GN airclean bags, just a bit redesigned. They work just the same.

  I always read reviews, but rarely write them. I felt compelled to write one for O'Keefe's Healthy feet as this is the real dead. I usually let my feet be handled by professionals - i.e. pedicures, but I recently had a baby and couldn't find the time to go for the better part of a year. I walk around barefoot all the time and almost always wear shoes without socks - flats, heels, flip flops, etc. Needless to say without the bi-monthly pedicures and the love I should be showing my piggies, the neglect I've given my feet made them look like they've seen better days. Honestly, I would get embarrassed by the heels of my feet because they were so dry and hard and starting to crack. I purchased a pumice stone and went to town on these monsters with little to no help long term.I saw a commercial for the O'Keefe's hand cream and was intrigued enough to check them out and saw that they also made a foot cream. I figured it was no harm, no foul and ordered it.It felt really nice on my feet. Not greasy and I felt like it really penetrated the skin. I TRIED to use it once or twice a day, but mostly just remembered right before I was going to sleep. And let me tell - after 1 WEEK - WOW!!! There was a major difference. I did help the process along with one or two sessions with that pumice stone, but mainly it was the cream and a pair of cotton socks at night that really helped my feet turn around.And then after 3 weeks ... I couldn't believe the difference. The cracks were repairing and the awful dryness was gone! My feet feel soft and CLEAN. (you know how dry skin makes everything look dirty!!!)I'm going to continue to use this everyday - as long as I remember - and no longer be embarrassed by my troll like heels again! And maybe, just maybe I'll find time to get a pedicure and they'll be all ""wow you're feet are so soft!!!!"" Thanks O'Keefe's!!!Picture is before, after 1 week and after 3 weeks.

  This stuff is amazing. Seriously. My feet have been cracked non-stop for probably the last 10 years. I've tried literally everything- Pedicures, Ped-egg, Gold Bond foot cream, lotion every night with socks on, pumice stones, that ridiculous mouthwash/shaving cream home ""remedy""...I was just about to buy a foot chemical peel when I saw this and figured I'd give it a shot before spending $25 and having 2 weeks of peely feet. I'm 32 years old and was incredibly embarrassed by my feet.After the first week of using it nightly (no socks) I was still a bit skeptical because there was a slight improvement, but not much.The second week I was like okay, we're getting there...The third I was like THANK GOD! Something has finally worked!After 4+ weeks my feet have never been better. They are still a little surface dry, probably because I only use it at night, but there are ZERO cracks in them. I haven't used a pumice stone or gone to get a pedicure since I started using it, so my results are only because of the lotion. I do scrub them down every other week or so with a buffer just to keep them soft.My only complaint is that the lotion is thick, so I don't like the way it feels on my hands, but I expected that given that it's for cracked heels and less creamy lotions won't work as well.Overall, I couldn't recommend this more. I know I sound like an infomercial, but I can honestly say this is worth every penny. One jar used once a day will last you probably about a month and you can buy it at bed bath and beyond for $6.99.

  Love this stuff! Been living with cracked feet for YEARS! Stuff is a miracle!Tips:1. Instead of wearing a sock which I find absorbs the cream (a waste in my opinion) - wear a silicone heel protector for 15 to 30 minutes after applying. The silicone will hold in the moisture in instead of absorbing it.This is will allow your foot to absorb the cream fully. I fully believe the reason my feet healed so fast was because I used silicone heel pads with the cream.2. Do not apply this cream and expect to be walking around anytime soon after. It is a very greasy formula (that’s a good thing for your foot!) - I put it on right before bed and read a bit while it works. I take the silicone protectors off and go to bed immediately after.3. It tingles a bit but I didn’t find it overly annoying. I used it once a day only at bedtime.  I saw results the morning after.

  I wouldn't blame you if you threw up a little looking at the before and after pics. I'm 30 years old and thought to myself ""my good feet days are in the past "". I'm originally from Miami so it's almost 365 days of flip flops or open toe shoes. I tried EVERY lotion, special Dr. Prescription moisturizing lotion, even at home foot scrubs and soaks, overnight foot wraps. NOTHING WORKED! So fed up, I always go on Amazon to read reviews and see what other people have tried. I came across this lotion. Figured what is there to loose but less than $10. So I tried it. From DAY ONE, it soothed my Crack heels. My heels were so badly cracked it hurt to walk. I honestly don't know how my feet got to this point...I even purchased a pumice stone, the ""as seen on tv ped egg"". Nothing works as good, and as FAST AS this lotion. I am so happy I feel like writting a letter to the company telling them I am SUCH A HAPPY CAMPER! No more being shy, embarrassed how my feet look. I'm telling you, my feet were in such bad shape that even after scrubbing with HOT WATER, SOAP AND the pumice stone...my heels still looked dirty because the cracks were so deep. My 10 year old kid said ""Mom, did you wash your feet""? Super embarrasing. Now I go to my Yoga class barefoot no embarrassment. I can go to the beach with my nice looking feet and of course wear my sandals with confidence.  THANK YOU AMAZON for speedy delivery and thank you O'Keeffe's for developing and marketing such a WONDERFUL PRODUCT. I will forever be great full and always recommend this to family and friends!! :-D

  These are the perfect outdoor string lights.  The price is right and light set is well made and appears heavy duty. The lights bulbs are a great size and provide the perfect outdoor patio lighting.  The light strings can be added together for as much lighting as you need. We have put them along our fence and on our trellises.  We live in Fl and our weather can be very hot and often very wet and our lights have never failed in the past 3 months.  We bought 4 sets, put them on a timer and just love them.

  Had been looking to get some stringed like such as these for a while and all the ones I found in stores looked cheaped and did not offer the true Edison look I was hoping for. I order one strand of these and when I got them in and realized the quality I quickly ordered a second. Above each light is a hole which you can use to hang with nails which is super useful instead of a cheap clip. I use mine inside and plan on ordering several more this summer when I look to add some outside.

  I bought a 24’ string from Harbor Freight Tools while shopping out of town. When I put them up I found I really liked them and wanted to purchase more. I looked in local stores but they were twice the price. I found this 48ft string the price was cheaper than any others anywhere (online or in stores). I’ve put them up with the 24ft string to run the perimeter of my patio. They are perfect!!  I used cup hooks, or hooks with screw ends, to hang them. The only problem I had was with the lightbulbs. When I moved the box the bottom came open (it isn’t secured shut) and I lost the 3 extra bulbs to the concrete patio floor. :(  Glad extra came with the purchase.  Maybe in the future the company could secure the top and bottom of the box with tape.

   I really, really, really want a planetarium projector with more than just a rotating disk so until that day comes I'm willing to satisfy my need and budget with this light show, and a worthy light show it is.  This is the best drunk Amazon purchase I've made hands down.  The laser stars and rotating nebula make me wish I lived in a THC friendly state.  I've had it for a few months now and have no complaints. The stars and nebula are bright. It shuts down after 4 hours and doesn't seem to make any noise like I've read in another review. So far, so good.  Totally worth the investment if like a trippy light show for your living area.

  I’m totally addicted to this thing. If I’m going to spend a significant amount of time in a room I’ll bring it with me. It’s great for really anything, even watching tv or enjoying a magical bath. It’s quite beautiful and relaxing.It’s easy to use and small, my only complaint in the placement of the buttons: whenever I pick up the unit or try to adjust it, I inevitably push one and have to figure out which one it was and then cycle through them again to get to where I was. And, this has become more minor as time goes on, I do wish the stars were blue or white instead of green. Some of the seller’s images make them look more along this spectrum, but, it’s still enjoyable. For the price this can’t be beaten, I’m seriously tempted to get one for every room.Pro tip: try placing candles or other warm, soft light near the wall and center the projector on it. Creates some very pretty magenta and purple colors, and it looks even more like a nebula.

  when I received it I was so happy to give it to my son , when I plugged it in it got power for a few seconds then went off. Like most I took it out the box and plugged it in without reading the instructions so I thought that was the issue. No it was just that the power cord was loose, no it was that the power cord was too pushed in ... I made so many excuses because I wanted it to work. this thing is not even worth a dollar at this point because it comes on when it wants too and it works when it wants too. I recommend passing on this one . I really wanted it to work. Amazon is sending me a replacement , this thing better work out the box or else I want a full refund . My sons party went off without a hitch , but he really wanted this as well and it bombed.update the replacement worked for a whole day , tried it out guess what ... trash !

  After having difficulty with different brands of smart plugs in the past, I was wary about buying ones online again, but I decided to trust the great reviews this product had. I'm so glad I did! The setup literally took minutes, and was so easy.The 5-Minute Setup:- Download the ""Kasa"" app- Tapped the ""+"" button in the top right corner to add a new smart plug and then tapped on ""Smart Plug""- Found the model of my smart plug on the bottom of the plug itself (these are model HS103) and selected the right model- Plugged the smart plug into the wall and went through the 1-minute easy setup on the screen- Opened my Google Home app to see a newly-added banner at the top that said ""add tp-link"" so I clicked on that- Selected all three of the new lamps I had set up- Asked Google to turn off one of the lamps and -BAM- just like that, the lamp turned off!Tips:- Instead of choosing a random icon for your smart plug, please take a picture of the device it will be controlling. Trust me, this will come in handy later.- Select nicknames that are unique and distinct, like proper names. My lamps are named Kirk, Eddie, and Olive. Weird? Yeah. But there's a method to this madness: the Google Assistant has difficulty interpreting my request to turn off my bedroom lamp, or to turn on my bedside lamp, when I have three lamps in one room. Having names like Eddie or Kirk help Google get the right lamp, every time. Plus, it's easier for you to remember that the lamp on your nightstand is called ""Brian"" instead of ""Bedroom Lamp #1.""Do I recommend this product:- Hell yes. Now I can live the lazy fantasy of my dreams, sans complicated setups or weird technical errors. Ah, to be lazy in the age of technology.That is all. If you've made it this far, just buy the damn smart plugs. You can thank me later.

  I have a detached shed which is over 40 feet from  where my router is.  The shed is 20 feet long and the florescent light is at the very back.  So I bought one of these to be able to turn on the shed light if I'm in the house or as I enter the shed where I have an echo dot plugged in.  Sure enough, Kasa mini plug works like a charm.  It's so nice not to have to go into a dark shed and fumble for the pull chain.  When my hubby comes in at night from fishing, I can turn on the shed light for him while I'm in the house watching tv.  I have these scattered all over the house.  In the basement, bedrooms, living room, kitchen....... anywhere you have a lamp with a cord.  I know they make them for wall switches too.  I wish I could use it with my Keurig, but you still have to push a button on the Keurig to activate the brewing..... so that won't work.  But if you had an old style coffee percolator and an echo in your bedroom, you can ask it to turn on before you get out of bed in the morning or even set it to come on and go off every day at a set time.  All these units can be set to operate on a schedule or even cause your lights to go on randomly if you're on vacation.  You can also remotely operate one or your lights from your cell phone or IPad.  I used one with a small table fan in my bedroom this summer.  If I got too cold at night, I didn't have to get up to turn it off.  I just said... Echo, Fan OFF......and vice versa......if I got too hot, all I had to say was Echo, Fan on.I've use these for over a year now, with not a single problem from any of the 10 units I have.  Very easy to set up. I'm a 70 yr old gal and if I can do it.........you can too.  Be sure you set up using a 2G network...last I knew it doesn't work on 5G

  I bought a bunch of these to replace a slew of Belkin WeMo's that were absolutely horrible. They never worked consistently. The Kasa switches are much more reliable and have great so far.One major complaint is that you cannot program an offset time for sundown or sunrise. For example, I have my landscape lighting set to turn on at sundown. But I have a lot of trees that block the sun late in the day, so I would like the lights to turn on 30 minutes before sundown. The WeMo's had that ability — to set for sundown -30 minutes. Since sundown changes a little bit every day, the switch would always activate 30 minutes before actual sundown.The Kasa app does not have that ability. You either set it by sundown - which is too late for me - or you manually set it. But if you set it manually, then every week you have to be making adjustments. Major pain because I need this feature on about half of my switches.Kasa, please add this functionality to the app. It cannot be that difficult, really. Do that and I would immediately change my review to 5 stars.

  I made the mistake of buying a cheaper 4 pack.  They did not integrate with Alexa at all.  These have always worked with no hitches at all.  I have a quirky printer, so I plugged into one of these and at 3am it turns off and on to reboot itself so it's ready for work that day.  I have my living room lights and bedroom light on it.  I tell Alexa I'm ready for bed and the bedroom turns on, the loving room turns off and she tells me to rest well.  And when I'm out of town that randomly turn lights and a radio on and off.  I'll never buy another brand.

  I should have second guessed myself when I saw a 4-pack for this price.  I guess the panic of prime day makes you not read as well.  On he full version of the plugs, they clearly lable 15A capable.  But on this page, not a single reference to amperage rating.  Which of course means they are not 15A capable but rather ""less than 12 amps"".  Which isn't terrible for a single lamp, fan, decoration.  But if you thought you'd use it for any device you use on a 15A circuit, you would be wrong and burn up this ""Lite"" model.  I love TP-Link Kasa stuff, I have tons of lights and sockets and 6-port power strips, I think they make great stuff.  I just really really have come to despise Amazon and their incomplete or mixed up descriptions of products.  Does it say ""lite"" up in the main part of the page?  Nope, only once, way down in the specs section.  So this item gets 1-star for being deceptive.  FYI HS105 is the 15A product, HS103 is the 12A.  P1-P2-P4 is the multi-packs.

  We are way past the baby proofing stage but we purchased a deeply discounted refrigerator from one of the box hardware stores. It was deeply discounted because someone bought it, requested to have the door open the opposite way which required the store to remove the hinges and install them on the other side of the fridge.  We bought it as a second fridge for our large 5 person (3 teens) family to keep in garage.  Long story short the door to the freezer and fridge would fall open all the time.  Someone would walk by it and it would pop open.  So I bought these straps to add  a 'latch' to each of the doors.  They were easy to install and are easy to open.  No more problems with finding the doors open and fridge in defrost mode.  I'm a little concerned how long the adhesive will work but so far they are rock solid.  ON a humorous note, I had to show 2 of the teens how to open the latches (I'm thinking it's more due to laziness on their part because the latches pop open easily when done right).  So if two teens can't open them I'm guessing it should keep a toddler from getting into trouble for a little while.

   Pros: They do the job and they're easily adjustable. We've only had them on a week, but they have stayed on well in areas we use frequently thus far.Cons: Compared to other brands and style of locks I've used, they're not the smoothest/easiest to open one handed, especially in a hurry. After using these, I prefer the ""pinch"" style locks. You have to apply light pressure to slide it out to the unlocked position, but then you must simultaneously pull out to unlatch from the base and the small amount of plastic there is to grab/hook your finger on isn't much (see pictures and video.)I've used 2 of the 4 in the box I got. Will I use those when the time comes? Yes. Would I buy these again? No.

  Every time my 18 month old was suddenly quiet and not in my direct sight I would come to find her happily loading up our toilet with toilet paper. I found this product on Amazon and purchased it given the good reviews and price. I’m happy to say it was super easy to install and easy for adults to quickly unlatch. I found given the shape of my toilet I had to place the latch in the front. If you can place yours more on the side that would be ideal so the strap won’t be hanging between your legs while you are using the toilet. Oh and most importantly- I’ve won this battle with my toddler. Is it wrong to laugh at a baby as they try to open the toilet lid? :)

  I actually got these to secure my washer and dryer from my son's 8 month old 90 lb German Sherpard puppy. He stays in the laundry room when we aren't home and he's so smart he figured out how to open the pedestals. He was destroying the toilet paper, paper towels, light bulbs, grocery bags, etc...that I store in there. Since installing these, he can't open the pedestals! (I do have 1 on each side because it didnt seem as secure with just having 1 in the middle- as he is really strong). These keep him out, but are also easy enough for me to unlatch when I need into the pedestal drawer.

  The product itself did not work for what I purchased it for. I bought them to secure our toilet lids because our toddler keeps flushing things down the toilet. The adhesive did not stick to the bowl itself. The company, “Joel Baby” emailed me about my satisfaction with the product and I explained this to them. They were very helpful and ended up refunding me as they did not have a substitute available. Great customer service and even though the product didn’t work for me, I would definitely purchase from the company again. As for the product itself, I imagine they would work great on cabinets or a refrigerator. The adhesive just didn’t work well with the porcelain on the toilet bowl.

  A friend of mine who uses this on his RV fridge recommended it.  We bought this for our refrigerator in the garage, the freezer door of which sometimes popped open.  That's bad news when you have frozen expensive meat and the temp in the garage is over 100 degrees.  It worked absolutely perfectly!

  This is a great solid product, but unfortunately doesn't fit the outlet I wanted it for. There is a peg on the backside of the extender that doesn't line up with the top plug in the outlet. See attached photos.

  In general, this is a great surge protector with the bonus of having 2 USB charging ports included.  Two major downsides for me are:  (1) The casing is not designed to fit flush against the wall, leaving a visible gap around the edges of the surge protector between it and the wall, and (2) The surge protector  is designed to fit over both electrical outlet plugs in a standard outlet, but the surge protector only plugs into the receptacle of one outlet and then has a small plastic nub that fits into the bottom outlet rather than plugging into both and utilizing the electrical connections of both outlets.  I have an older model that plugs into both outlets and fits flush against the wall, making it much sturdier, cosmetically smooth and seamless, and half of the expansion outlets in the older model are powered by each of the two outlets in the receptacle rather than all of them being powered by (and anchored into) just one of the wall receptacle plugs.Although the surge protector bolts into the wall socket/receptacle, the fact that it is not flush to the wall combined with not being plugged fully into both outlets of the wall receptacle leaves it slightly loose, and you must be extra careful unplugging appliances from the surge protector.  I place one hand against the surge protector cover to hold it firmly in place while I unplug the cord(s) I want to disconnect.  Having an older model that plugs into both outlets and bolts flush to the wall set a great standard that I have not been able to find again.  Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but I know this surge protector COULD be better if designed to improve the two mentioned weaknesses.  Otherwise, I like it enough that I purchased two more for other locations where family members often vie for access to charge their electronic devices, or where they kept unplugging lamps, landline phones, and other stationary electrical devices to charge their phones or tablets.  These provide many more outlets in the same location and the capability to plug in USB cords directly instead of bulky adapters, and no one has a good excuse to unplug the lamps, alarm clock, or landline telephone charger.

  Reading through the reviews here, it seems as if Amazon has merged reviews for two different products from the same manufacturer.  I have several of both products shown in the photos.  I read some folks complain about the product not being snugly affixed to a wall outlet.  We do not have that problem.  As shown in photo #1, there is no space between the surge protector and the wall socket.  We affixed the unit to the outlet using the long screw provided.  BUT, you should note how these things work.  This is attached, via that screw, to the wall outlet, and the wall outlet needs to be affixed firmly to the electrical box in which it resides.  If you take off the wall outlet cover and there is play in the outlet itself, tighten it.  Then place the cover and the surge protector over the outlet and affix the long screw through both into the outlet.  The more firmly seated the outlet in the box, the firmer the surge protector and outlet cover plate will be.The other product is shown in photo #2.  I purchased this product specifically because it only uses one, not two, plugs.  As you can see in the last photo, this single gang outlet is on our kitchen island counter side, and so I needed an extension device to provide more outlets than the single plug.  This device does NOT have a screw to affix it to the outlet behind it, so yes you have to be careful in unplugging devices from it else you can pull it out of the outlet.  On the flip side of the coin, this surge protector is rotatable so you can rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise to have the surge protector horizonal, and you can even rotate it a full 180 degrees so that it is vertical with the USB ports facing down toward the floor.  Why would anyone want to do this?  If those USB ports are not in use, you can accumulate dust if they are facing UP.Each of these surge protectors work well and have their benefits and drawbacks.  So before you select one, know how you will be using it, where you will be using it, and then make your decision on which to purchase.  The first one is nice for counter uses - the photo shows one in our bathroom adjacent to the makeup vanity.  The cell phone sits on top in the holder quite nicely.  The second surge protector works well in our kitchen island counter - we have one on either end of the counter - and we purchased an additional one that we keep in our travel pack for when we get to the hotel and find they don't have sufficient outlets.

  How well this functions as a surge protector, we have not verified.  But the combination of MOV, TVS, and GDT should handle surges quite well.As other reviewers have written, this thing can be quite loose and downright wobbly if not anchored properly.Best way to secure this thing to a standard duplex outlet?  First remove the center screw that holds the strike plate (cover) over the outlet.  Do not discard the strike plate.  place the strike plate under the surge protector, keeping everything in line with the long screw that comes with the surge protector.  Then carefully plug the surge protector into the outlets, without letting the strike plate slip, and screw everything together.  The surge protector will wobble a bit but it will stay in place.I only tried the vertical orientation this was designed for.  I do not know how well it would hold in horizontal orientation.

  This review is for my purchase of Chamberlain myQ-G0401 - Wireless Smart Garage Hub in White color:Background:I have tried a couple of brands with my Chamberlain garage door opener unit and for the most part none have been perfect.I am very versed in technology and have over 70 automated (IOT) devices at home and easily installed.I have a VERY strong internet connection and a Mesh internet router setup where 100% of my house has 100% full bar connectivity - no dead zones at all for any of my devices. Well till I bought this unit...This unit:I decided to purchase and give this newer 2020 version a try. The hope is for consistent operation.Issue to date:The install should be a cake. Follow the in app instructions and all should be done as easy as 1, 2, 3.Well... so I hoped.For me all worked fine except when the unit tried to connect to my WiFi, it showed it as weak signal (1 bar). All my other units have full 3-4 bars.I even took the unit and put it next to one of my routers and then it showed 2 bars. Still weak connection.So... after much try and moving the unit close and moving one of my routers to garage next to this unit, then it now works.But for most of you who unlike me do not have a $1000 wireless network mesh, and even then not wanting to move one of the routers to the garage next to this unit, then forget about buying this awful product.Simply, the radio signal receiver is just bad.I can not stress this more, ALL my other units on my network have a 100% connectivity bar except for this unit.For me after some 1 hour of frustration, it now works (so far), and the only (it’s major) issue was trying to connect to the internet.Update - after several months of utilization:The device continues to be connected to wifi (read above), however, the device and its separate door sensor (tells the unit door is open or closed), often lose connectivity and thus falsely notifies me during the day or middle of night that my garage door is now open. It freaked me out several times when I was away or on vacation.Worse... you think the door is open so you click the app button to close it, just to then realize in the evening upon return to home that you opened the garage door vs. closing it due to the unit misread. I’ve been bugging the neighbors to check if door is open or closed every time this thing falsely triggers.Lastly, there’s a cool feature you can turn on in the app that can close your garage door if the door is left open greater than xx minutes or after a special hour (like 10 pm). Well.. do not use it because in my case due to weak sensor and misread, in the middle of the night it would open the garage door by itself thinking it’s past 10 and the door is left open.I have disabled it now and thinking of unplugging the entire unit. It’s just more risk than reward.Best of luck.

  First off, I have friends with this unit that are happy with the quality and functionality. My experience with Chamberlain and this product were not as good.You should know if your garage door unit is not new (as in the last few years), you may encounter some issues with setup.My house was built in 2002, and the opener is original. The Chamberlain website notes compatibility with the Genie Excelerator, says ""you may need a garage door opener to finish setup."" Cool. I have that. No problem.I get everything setup, unit on the ceiling, monitor on the door. Everything is going great. The unit simply will not find my garage door motor. I've tried every which way. At times, it will randomly open and close during setup. But eventually the setup pukes out and directs me to customer service.This is where having this product goes in the garbage.I attempt to call Customer Service. They're on the west coast and closed for the day. No problem. I will email them. I get an immediate bounceback saying they will get back to me in two days. Four days later, I email them asking if they can address my issue. Two days later, they email some generic garbage instructing me to reset the device. Oh thanks!You may have good success with this. I did not. And I'm tech savvy. If your opener is more than a few years old, though, proceed with caution...or at least save the packaging so you can return the product like I am.If this was helpful, please hit the button.

  Well, after numerous hours and a week of headaches I finally figured out the hubs issues.  (1). Make sure you use the full length of the power cord, if you are plugging it in the same outlet as your garage door motor.  (2). Mount the hub as far away as you can from all lighting and motors (ie garage door motor).  (3). Have a good WiFi connection.  (4). Mount the garage door sensor on the same side of the garage that you mount the hub.  (5). Learn how to reset the hub, which is done by using the center “settings” button.  You may have to start from the beginning of the myQ app several times to connect to the WiFi, to pair the door sensor, and to pair the garage door opener to the hub.  And be prepared to spackle, sand and paint all the holes you may have made from trying to mount the hub in various locations.  No subscription is needed if you are just using the myQ app or the factory garage door remotes.  Bottom line:  it works!  Instructions could have been better, but it is finally installed and it works, and it was only $25.

  In a word, No. don’t even think about purchasing this garage hub. Easy to install but it loses signal constantly and is worthless without Wi-Fi. Rebooting the unit it will regain signal for 10 minutes before dropping it again. My router is literally 20 feet away, cell phone shows plenty of signal, WiFiSweetSpot also shows plenty, in a house where everything else connects without any issue (inside or out in the garage), the MyQ doesn’t. Just for fun, I even plugged in a Wi-Fi extender in the garage, rebooted everything and had exact same issues. Find another option, but I’m disappointed in my purchase, and will be sending back.EDIT: I'm changing this to a 2-star review but I did get it to work on my own. To get it to work, I followed the advice of someone on Youtube who suggested adding the MyQ device separately on a guest wifi network (he suggested a 2.4Ghz-only connection, I don't have that ability, so I set up a 2.4/5.0Ghz guest network and rebooted the hub and reset the wifi connection to the new network and it works for now). That fixed the issue for me and it does now work;, however, I never would have known that just using the instructions given by the manufacturer. I'm not sure why the MyQ device can't share the channel with other devices, but if you can set it up on a guest login by itself, you may have better luck. Hoping this will help someone else!

  Overall, Command hooks are one of the most amazing recent inventions. They really do hold their designated weight well, are easy to use, and come off the surface leaving no marks.I got these hooks for various small hanging tasks, among which are lightweight pictures. They will work for such, though the instructions that came with them insist they shouldn't be used with pictures, at all. I'm not sure what difference it makes in the long run.One thing that was annoying is these hooks are the anti-fancy. They are plain, to the point of being best used in service spaces. They will always be visible above whatever you use them for.Also, if you use them for something that you will often remove from the hook, such as keys, the hook isn't stationary. It' isn't attached to the wall in any way--only the white base is. So every time you lift something off the hook the hook lifts too, creating a bit of a tangle to get the thing off the hook. I'd rather the hooks be fully adhered to the base and not move.Also, I did not receive the correct number of hooks and adhesives in my box. I only received 14 hooks. I would get Command hooks again, though not from this vendor, and not this style.

  These failed in every way. I tried to hang a couple of SMALL canvas paintings -- 14x14. They weighed maybe a pound? As you can see from the photo, they ripped the paint off the wall when I tried to remove and reposition them. Then, the one that hadn't been removed just fell off, and my painting went crashing to the ground. Just... useless. I don't know. Maybe they aren't supposed to be used to hang canvas paintings? Don't know what else they would be for. They're just too small and delicate, and the adhesive is too weak. I prefer the Velcro-based picture-hanging Command strips. They haven't let me down. I'm returning these.

  These hooks are really easy to use, they hold up really well in cold or hot weather. They are easy to remove and use again someplace else. I've used them on plaster, vinyl, metal, stucco, wood, glass, fiberglass, stone, and, plastic and it's worked every time.

  We used it to hang the faux ivy and lights at our DIY shower. It was a low lit room, so wanted to add lighting without literally adding a lamp on the floor. These things worked great and didn’t damage my in-laws walls. We also used them to hang up other decor including the balloon cluster above the food table (pic before food was set out). Would definitely purchase again for everyday hanging around our house.

  I've had the drill for almost two years, and generally it's been pretty good. Good enough that I have repurchased the drill.Bad enough that it's literally shooting flames out the back when using it now, so I had to repurchase it -- as it's clearly unsafe to use if it's on fire.I have no idea if it's still under warranty, and there's no obvious way to contact Dewalt.update: I was in contact back/forth with Dewalt for nearly a month. They asked for proof of purchase, and I sent that to them. Then provided me with a free label to ship them the drill. After they had the drill, they then told me it's no longer under warranty, but fortunately for them they now have any evidence of a class action lawsuit about their drills catching fire in their possession. They offered to ""repair"" it for nearly full cost of the drill. I'm not sure why they couldn't have simply told me they were wasting my time immediately after sending them my proof of purchase which is when they would have known the warranty was no longer valid.

  Order these on a whim. I needed some new Dewalt's and saw this package deal for 20v Lithium drill set. Now, I will say this - Title is slightly deceiving as it's 20v Max and 12v base. Still does the job and works extremely well!! Used it to put my 4.5"" lift kit on my 92 Jeep and had no issues for the most part. Battery life is decent. For consistent pick up and use I got about a good 4 solid hours before she needed to change the battery ( That is undo a bolts, put down, line up new shackles thread on new bolts and then use dewalt to set them and lock them down).PROS:Lightweight, Great Price, Good Power (will lock on bolts super tight), Nice bag, quick charging timesCONS:States 12v with 20v Max - Not a true 20v, The LED light on the Impact drill is located under the bit, makes it hard to see what you are doing above it to line something up..Overall - For the price and what you get, I couldn't be happier! It helped me get the job done and will be using it for other jobs as well!

  Have many Dewalt tools and like the products.  Before purchasing saw a U Tube review that said SOME of the drills in this kit have a problem with the bits falling out of the drill chuck when the trigger is released.  So tested drill upon arrival and sure enough the bits kept falling out-the drill stops VERY fast and twists in your hand from torque.  Spoke to customer service  and without any problem from them sent it out-prepaid- for repair.  Got it back with same problem.  Now am sending to different service center (want it fixed and did not request a refund)  for replacement with a tested drill.  BTW, the impact driver and batteries in kit work great.  Company told me if drill does not work properly upon return, they will give me full refundUPDATE:  Sent drill to 2 service centers and couldn't seem to fix it.  Dewalt upgraded to better drill and gave me 2 new batteries and a charger at no charge  U should be aware that service tech stated that this is a ""consumer"" drill as compared to their more professional drill kits for more money.  That said, there is an expectation that it will work upon arrival.

  Disappointing entry from Dewalt.  I bought this to replace the older set I had and the lighter lithium batteries looked appealing.  Problem is, these things don't last.  I would get hours of use out of my old set.  For a big project I could go all day on one battery.  These last less than an hour on a full charge.  Very disappointing.  Every project takes twice as long because we have to keep charging the batteries.Two stars because when its fully charged, the tools work fine.  If you're looking for something to hang a set of curtains or a picture on the wall, this will work fine.  If you are somebody that uses your tools frequently, look elsewhere.

  I work in real estate and we used this lockbox for years until recently when we were unable to open one with the combo we had on file. It was a mystery to us, indeed. We were about to cut it off the fence, when I had an idea to google ways to open this lock box if you forgot the combo. My search IMMEDIATELY returned several YouTube videos on how to pick this lock.

I was able to pick both of our MasterLock lockboxes in under 3 minutes. And both combinations did not match what we had on file.

There are videos of how to easily pick this lock available online and it can happen to you.I cannot stress this enough. Last night we awoke to an intruder in our home who had cut this off our main gate and opened it (likely following the easily googled how-to videos), using the keys inside to enter our home.Luckily no one was hurt, but trust me that you never want to experience that situation yourself.

  Do not buy!!I bought this lock to keep my car key safe while I surf. I put my key in the lock and attach it my truck.  On my second use of this lock, I put in my combination, opened the lock, put my key in the chamber, and closed the lock.  An hour later, I tried to open the lock, and my combination would not work.  After 20 minutes, I had to call a lock smith to open the lock for me.  He mentioned that this are horrible locks because they are easy to crack and he went on to show me.  He first tried to crack it by feeling the combination.  There are multiple videos on how to do this on Youtube.  Once this did not work, he told me that the locking mechanism is missed aligned, and with in 5-7 seconds forced the unlocking lever down and pried open the door.  I am not kidding you, 5-7 seconds... I was left with my mouth open because he only used two very basic tools that i also own.  He smiled and said Yes it is that easy this locks are very easy to open ""Do not use it"". He did tell me that the locks where you have to punch in the combination are much much harder to crack.  He then continue to charge me 110 dollars that were very well deserved.Lessons learned.1. This lock will break at times leaving your valuables unaccessible.2. It will cost you at a minimun 110 dollars (I did called several to select the lowest priced)3. This lock is very easy to crack.

  Works well and seems rugged. I use it to keep an extra set of house keys outside when needed.  It looks securely onto my sliding glass door handle.Update 4/2017:  This hung on my back door for 5 months.  Not a soul ever touched it.  As with any locks, including those on your front door, anything can be broken into if someone wants to.  So as far as how secure this is goes, well how secure is your door even?  How much in your area is someone likely to try to break it open?  Those are all factors that go into whether or not this lock is ""safe"".  I am using it now at my Dad's house so that when necessary a caregiver can call me for the code and go into the house. This has saved me twice this week from having to turn around on my way to work and open a door for someone.  The code gets change after I give it out, and at times I can just remove the lock if I choose.  This beats the alternatives.  If someone wants into your home, they will get in anyway whether you have a key box out or not.

  I have been searching for a good oil to treat my butcher block countertop. After reading so many reviews on Amazon for different oils, I decided to give this one a try. I removed everything from my countertops and follow the instructions (I left it for 24hrs). I decided to apply the oil with my hands  (gloves on). I also put it on my acacia tea box and salt container. The following day I wiped it off with a towel.Looking at my stainless steel stove, fridge, and other surfaces in my kitchen I wanted to see how this oil will also work to revive it. I used the same towel and WOW, I couldn’t believe my eyes! Everything looks brand new.After years of wiping my counters and appliances clean with other daily cleaning products, this oil has brought everything back to life!This will be a staple in my kitchen. A little bit goes a long way.  I cannot believe I waited this long to try it!

  I purchased this mineral oil for two primary purposes.  The first was to protect my high carbon knives.  There are a lot of products that will do this, but many are not food safe.  In other applications, that might not be an issue, but I tend to use my knives in a variety of ways, including food prep, especially when I'm camping.  It's reassuring to know that I haven't coated my blade with something potentially dangerous.  As far as inhibiting rust, time will tell, but I have no reason to doubt this will do the job.The second reason I bought this was to oil my wooden cutting boards.  I'd previously used olive oil, but it has a tendency to go rancid, so I don't use it as often as I should.  Still, I'd thought my cutting boards were in pretty good shape until I treated the first one with this product.  I was pretty amazed at what a difference it made.  Plus, it imparted absolutely no smell that I could detect.  I'll definitely be oiling them more often now.My only complaint is that the bottle was pretty badly crushed in transit so that it doesn't even stand up.  I will no doubt have a major spill at some point because of this.  That is probably the fault of the packer or the shipper, though, and has no bearing on the quality of the product.

  I have a nice thick butcher-block style cutting board my dad made for me that was getting extremely dry (I probably hadn't oiled it in more than eight months...) but I lost my old board oil in a move. This stuff seemed to get good reviews on Amazon so I threw it in my cart, and I like it a lot better than the oil I had been using previously! My old stuff was pretty thick, meant to be wiped on with a rag. This stuff is thinner, more like vegetable oil (although slightly more viscous than that). Just gave my board a liberal squirt and spread it around and let sit overnight. Repeated the process the next day on the other side of my board and now it looks brand new!I also like that the bottle is more on the ""minimalist"" side (although that's a silly thing to make a purchase decision on), it just honestly *looks* nicer than other brands I was considering.

  Unfortunately, I had been neglecting my butcher block island.  I found this Food Grade Mineral Oil and applied a generous coat - I was amazed at how it brought the island back to life.  I gives a lovely coat to the island and the fact that it is food grade is imperative.  It went on easily and looks remarkable.  As I mentioned, it truly brought the island back to life.  I got two bottles so I could more regularly maintain my block!  Thank you for producing such a fabulous oil!!

  As a woodworker, I am always in search of the best oil finishes I can find, and I have tried plenty of them! Typically, I make hardwood furniture and use several coats of hand rubbed Pure Tung Oil; it creates a satin finish that shows off the wood's grain beautifully, and leaves the wood still looking like natural wood.  Occasionally, I make smaller items for gifts for my family and friends. In this photo is a Curly Maple cutting board I made for friends for Christmas. I have tried many cutting board finishes, and although they may hold up well, they don't seem to do justice to the beauty of the wood's grain, especially when it is highly figured.  I couldn't be more pleased with how this food grade mineral oil highlighted the beauty of the grain; close up it truly looks 3D! It has a thinner viscosity than most of the food grade products I've tried, I applied probably 7-8 thick coats to each side of the board, one after another, and all were rubbed in with my fingers! The wood just kept soaking it up, which surprised me since I sanded the Curly Maple up to 400 grit. When the wood seemed saturated and the oil ""sat on top"" in several areas on both sides, I let in soak in for an hour and buffed it with a soft cloth. It needs to soak in and dry for a day or two before use. It's best to simply wipe a board clean with a damp sponge and as little detergent as possible.I gave my friends a small container of this oil for reconditioning, in case, down the road, dry spots appear.I can't attest yet to how it holds up, but I will check in with my friends and give an update in the future. It is such a beautiful finish, I am almost tempted to try it on a small table to see how it holds up, and use additional coats of it like a furniture polish to maintain the finish, but cost effectiveness might be a concern with larger pieces. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

  I rated scent a 5 because I couldn’t tell that it had a scent. So far I’ve used it on 2 stainless steel sinks and on a new quartz countertop. As reviews have said, a little goes a long way. It made the sinks look great but to my surprise it made the new quartz top look great also. On the quartz it made the colors more vivid with a glossy look. I’d certainly recommend this and will buy again.The more I use this mineral oil, the more I like it. I’d include it with vinegar and duck tape as a household essential.

  I would give this zero stars if I could!!Wish I hadn’t spent money on these. The directions tell you to run the cup, then clean out the brewer by running one cup of clear water.  It took me OVER TWO GALLONS OF WATER, running the reservoir dry several times, to get the disgusting chemical smell and residue out of the brewer.  Thank God I didn’t try to drink a cup of coffe, as the directions said would be clean, after one “clean” cup!!Since the cleaning, I have had several malfunctions, from short cups (3-4 ounces when on 10 ounce setting) to complete stoppages that required needle cleaning.

These cleaning cups fixed both of my issues and especially liked that it was really quick and easy to use… I put the cleaning pod in and ran one cycle, then took the pod out and ran a rinse cycle to clean out any leftover grinds.

And then the main test goes on, so not only did I slam it full of plugs, including a space heater, as all other outlets are slap full and loving the extra room on 2 plugs that needed extra room, and guess what this bad boy never even got warm on me!

  Really needed more plugs for my living room, since there's always a problem if there is more than one person who wants to use their laptop, plug in a game, and charge their phone. I tried the usb port with my Samsung lightening cable for my phone, and it worked just as good as usual-convenient so my friends don't need to bring around matching adaptors. The spacing is very convenient for my laptop to have room next to the TV plug, amd now I can extend it and reach the hdmi port at the same time. The cable has a good amount of reach but it's thick and won't tangle, overall worth the purchase.

  At just over $20, this is a no-brainer. For the same price, companies like GE try to sell you a 6 outlet with a fat plug and 2nd rate internals. This is a quality, plastic power strip with 10 outlets, 4 usb ports, minimal sleek plug that doesn't block other outlets, and a very value oriented set of quality internals. I mounted it to the underside of my computer desk and routed cables into it for a cleaner, organized look. For the cost of a pizza, this is something that will last you a long time with no issues. Highly recommend.

  I really liked this product for the versatility of the AC outlets and USB outlets.  Seems well made and I really like the flat surface on the AC outlet strip.  Needed to replace my old power strip to get ready for cord cutting to occur in this household.The only fault I would note is that it has the traditional straight plug where I prefer a flat ac plug.  Remedied easily enough by cutting existing plug off and added my own flat plug procured here on Amazon.  Would have been nicer and cheaper if it came on the power strip cord.  I would have even paid a bit more if it had the flat ac plug feature. A flat plug would have earned the 5 star for versatility.I'll update if performance is an issue.

  I really like this power board.  I did a lot of research before I bought this.  Read all the comments and make sure this meets my needs.  I have different shapes of charging cords that need them in different ways.  This applies to those types.  There is enough space between the plugs to be able to rotate the items in different ways and still safely install them.  There are four USB ports on the end that can be used when needed without the need for a plug.  Will come back soon to buy more of this project.  Highly recommended.  A large-scale thunderstorm has occurred in our area.  Our electricity really disappeared, and my surge protector worked as it imagined.  If everything is important, I don’t do anything on any of my electronic devices.

  This power strip surge protector is the answer. Having so many digital devices its nearly impossible to keep them all plugged in while on my nightstand. Now I have all of my devices plugged in with several outlets to spare. My wife pulled a ""Debo"" when it was first delivered. She used it for all of the interior Christmas lifts including the tree and there were still open outlets on this thing. I purchased a 2nd one because I don't want to have to piledrive her on the bed for snatching mine anymore. Very nice product. Very pleased. Fast shipping.

  Enough plugs and ports for all my electronics.  It have a flat base which is great if you want to tape it to the wall, underneath the table, or whatever to hide it from the view.  The cord is 6ft long which is awesome.  Four USB-B ports plus ten outlets with plenty of space in-between allowing for easier arrangement of different types of plug.

  There are several terrific elements to this power strip. First, two of the outlets are placed in such a way that the large boxy power adapter plugs at the end of many electronic devices can be plugged in without compromising the outlet immediately next to it. This means a lot to me, since I have Google Nest prongs to plug in along with other large adapter plugs. In a ten outlet strip I can actually use all ten outlets! Woo-hoo! Second, the unit still manages to be compact. It is also surprisingly sturdy while maintaining a low profile. It's the perfect power strip for my home video setup.

  I had to google differences between KN95 and N9 masks - KN95 are similar to N95 masks, but made in China.  These appear to be high quality with good manufacture quality.  The metal strip around the nose is robust and makes a good seal over the nose bridge (one of my biggest peeves with cheap masks).  The cone is also super helpful to keep the mask material from sucking into your nose and mouth during inhalation.  Ear loops are snug, but not as tight as I'm used to for some other N95 masks.  Can't comment on whether these are as effective as real N95s, but they definitely seem subjectively much more effective than regular surgical or procedural masks (as they should).  Looks like on the CDC website these have received approval for FDA-EUA.

  I love these masks. First of all, I have glasses and every other mask I have bought before fogs up my glasses. These ones have a tight seal at the top of the mask, so it does not fog up my glasses. The mask overall has a great, tight fit but not too tight that it becomes uncomfortable. I also like that it is color black so it hides stains and is a sleeker look. A really great price/value for 50 masks, and much better protection than surgical masks.. I leave a few in the car and the rest at home. This will last us a very long time.

  This masks creates such a great seal. I work as a nurse in cardiology and these are good masks. I was also looking for a mask that created a good seal around my boyfriends beard and this mask does it! He's shaved his beard off a couple of times so the surgical masks would be a better fit and now he doesn't have to. The hair doesn't get in the way which is great. They feel multi layered and they stay stiff in position. I recommend them!

  You get 2 sealed packs of 25 masks. They seem thick enough to be effective, and the bendable nose piece allows it to conform to most shapes.The ear loop elastic was a bit too tight for my liking, so I don’t think I’d want to wear it all day, but given the price they seem good for short use.

  These masks have helped me a lot at work. I'm able to speak much more clearly with the extra space it provides (even while wearing a face shield). I can also see amount of air it filters by putting my mask on securely and breathing in and out. The mask will slightly shrink and expand when breathing. This masks is also acceptable at my work where I would have to wear two masks instead of just this one. Wearing two masks and a face shield can make it very hard to speak and be understood. Other than the strings on the sides not being the strongest, this is a perfect buy. Caution. Don't pull perpendicular to the attachment of the ear holding strings. They will come off with enough force.

  These masks fit great and are easy to breath with when worn. When going out in public I much prefer a cloth face mask that's re-usable, but opted to test these out since they were black and looked comfortable. While they're super breathable, I think I will add these to my collection of tools in the garage and use them when I paint or do wood working projects. The masks are disposable and are more suited for one time use applications, so I feel more comfortable using them for such projects.They work really well for wood dust, especially when cutting and sanding wood. For small jobs I can typically go without wearing a dust mask and be okay, but I've had an irritated sinus or throat afterwards on larger jobs where I was too lazy to grab a mask or didn't have one handy. Wearing these I had zero issues after a ton of sanding one day, so I highly recommend them.

  What started us on this purchase was my wife overhearing a conversation at a medical center near us.  Another client was relating how her daughter worked for a hotel whose owner wanted his maids to not change the sheets from previous customers and just leave them on the bed for the next arrivals if they didn't look too dirty.  This shocked my wife, and her physical therapist told her that this little device was what she took along to inspect hotel and motel rooms before she decided to stay, or possibly to move to another room if the situation warranted.  It truly is shocking what you will find in a room that your naked eye never sees.  If you thought you were a fabulous housekeeper, guess again.  If you think ANY motel or hotel in which you have stayed is really clean, guess again.  Maids even in the best of places hit only the surface.  We also recommend taking along sanitary wipes and anti-bacterial spray and hitting the toilet before using, the light fixtures, the tv remote, etc.  If you think that ignorance is bliss, you will not want to get this light.  Yet, if you think that protecting yourself against possible messes and negligent and irresponsible hotel owners and lazy maids is wise, I would urge you to own one.  In motel rooms, we have found stuff splattered on walls that could not be seen.  We have found that most bed covers have a lot of dust, and the dust ruffles on beds are often quite dirty.  Tubs that looked normal to the eye were often exposed in older hotels as having lost much of their enamel.  Stains are found in virtually every motel room.  Do we stay in flea bags when we travel?  No!!  We don't stay in the most expensive places normally, but we stay in hotels which have high customer ratings and avoid the ones with low customer ratings.  We check under all the mattresses for bed bugs to make sure we don't take those little critters home with us.  That alone is worth the price.  I believe that ignorance is not bliss, especially when it comes to following other folks that we do not know into a living space they have occupied.  We are NOT germaphobes, but then again, taking precautions is not a foolish thing either.  Is this little gem worth the small price you will pay?  ABSOLUTELY.

  Was a little leery due to some negative reviews.  My sister bought one when she got a puppy and recommended it.  It works well, and what it reveals is disturbing but helpful.I use Nature’s Miracle in the red not white bottles (which I highly recommend) to clean up canine messes. I could tell which spots I missed, which ones I treated well (coz I couldn’t find them and I know the pup peed there), and which spots I didn’t spray a big enough area.  There would be big clear spot in the middle and faint borders where I didn’t spray enough on the edges.Use it in the dark. It’s like the lights in the indoor glow in the dark golf places.  It’ll highlight other things like miscellaneous fuzz or little particles on the carpet.  So you may want to vacuum first or you may see psychedelic little particles everywhere.  My finger and toe nails all glowed in the dark too.I pointed the flashlight pretty much straight down and would sweep back forth for thoroughness.  It also illuminated other weird spills which left a trail as though someone was walking while spilling something (hopefully not tinkling while walking around).  Spots I missed (so didn’t treat with Natures Miracle) really glowed brightly.  Ones I should treat again were much fainter.  I found disturbing spots where someone peed on the baseboard and the post for the stairs. (Maybe the previous owner’s dog since they were rather low to the ground.)Buy it.  Hope you don’t get too grossed out.

  These are VERY nice masks. With five layers of protection and a soft, skin friendly material, I can wear these masks comfortably for extended periods.

They are  securely anchored and this is the first mask I've purchase in quite a while that doesn't require loop extenders or cord locks for a secure fit. Yes...this product does come individually wrapped in a nicely sealed sleeve. But in these troubled time I'm very fussy about what I put on my face. Every mask that comes into my home (reguardless of the point of origin) is throughly cleansed in my UV-C sanitizer and stored, prior  to use, in a labeled zip lock bag. I've bought a lot of masks in the past ten months or so. This product easily ranks in the top two for quality, comfort, and overall  satisfaction.

  Let's start off by acknowledging the pure money grab when it comes to PPE.  And like all other merchants we are being charged the price pre pandemic of a genuine 3M N95 mask.

It fits like its sized not like a fit all sized mask.  Since I haven't used steroids ever, I dont think my head as grown, but I'm still going to have to get a different brand.  I'm pretty familiar with different mask types and how they should fit, and this can be used with kids of smaller faced adults.  The seal breaks whenever I talk or even smile.

  This mask provides a comfortably snug and contoured close fit as a KN95 mask should. The air space in the front allows me to breathe more easily than the blue surgical masks.

  I wanted a kn95 due to the increase in covid.  When I got it I was surprised that some parts of the mask imprint looks transparent, see picture.  Out of concern I tested the mask with water, and the mask was able to hold water without leaks.  So that seems good.The breathing wasn't too hard, and it feels fairly comfortable.  Although I feel the mask should be slightly tighter to prevent air leak somewhere.  I suppose people can tie small knots on the string to make it shorter and therefore tighter to ensure a better seal.  However this probably will also make it slightly harder to breathe.  So weight your needs carefully.All kn95 masks on the market seems to folded in half out of the box.  Note that will make the metal nose stripe more likely to fold in v shape when you put on.  But your nose top is u shaped.  So you probably want to unfold the metal flat and refold  slightly to the side to make a u shape molding to better fit your nose.

  Some people said there is a gap and I don’t find that to be true. The edges don’t seal but I drew yellow lines where it is actually making contact around my mouth and nose about an inch from the edge. There are no air gaps and thats all I cared about. Much better than my other disposable and cloth masks. The wire on the nose adjusted easily and the ear loops are soft. I’ll update if I encounter any issues

  After a few days of use, I think this kn95 mask is more comfortable than the one I used before. First of all, I like the color of the mask very much. Black can make my face thinner visually. Secondly, the quality of this mask is no problem. It's very comfortable, and it's very suitable for the whole face. I wrap my nose and mouth tightly, but it doesn't hinder my breathing. My breathing is still very smooth, and I don't feel suffocated. The texture and comfort of this mask are worth using. I also recommend this mask to my classmates and friends. Under the test of such a severe epidemic, everyone should wear masks to protect the safety and health of individuals and others.

  The size of the tarp is smaller than advertised on the product label and website descriptionI bought the 9 by 12 tarp to wall off an area that is 11-feet-4 inches wide and 7-feet-10 inches tall. I started securing the tarp at the top corner, about 3 inches from the actual edge of the space, expecting to have another 3-5 inches of slack on the other side. Nope. It didn't reach the other side.So I tried again, this time starting right on the edge of the space. This time, it *barely* made it to the other side, and I had to leave some extra slack in the rope on that side, leaving a noticeable gap in the enclosure. The height made it down to the floor, but definitely not with an extra 14 inches of slack as it should have. It was maybe 4 inches.They advertise a 9 by 12 tarp, but sell you a tarp that is barely more than 11 by 8. They should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of honestly and/or geometry skills.

  I purchased this expecting a really, really cheap tarp.I was therefore actually pretty surprised at how truly crappy this one was.The grommets were only half installed, not aligned with the actual hole in the tarp, or completely missing.One corner was folded back on itself and stuck together - when I tried to straighten it, it ripped, leaving a hole.I think you could probably choose about any other tarp randomly on Amazon and it would be better.

  I do not believe I have ever seen tarp this thin and I have bought and used 20+ over time for various tasks.  It feels more like a plastic rather than tarp. It leaked water the very first day and doesn't seem it will last long. I am just disappointing about how rigged Amazon review system is (there is no way this many positive reviews are authentic for this product and I wasted so much time and money on this.I am only guessing that the calculation on this is that even if 1 out of 5 buyers keeps the tarp, they still make profit since it costs them probably around $2 to make these in China. then, if the return rate gets too high, they just switch the name. These people are despicable for offering this type of garbage and Amazon needs to figure out how the system is rigged (they probably will not since they also profit from this sale; or this could even be their own brand).Attached are the pictures to see the how light goes through and how purely woven it is. Even the aluminum grommets look extremely cheap and uneven.

  This tarp arrived ripped. It was the 8x10 as ordered but it wasn't 8 feet nor was it 10' - much shorter on both sides. I was trying to cover sandboxes and the measurements mattered. It says it is 5 mil thick, but it feels so very thin - thinner than the 5 mil tarps (also blue, laminated, tight 8x8 weave) that we got from Home Depot. At first I was pleased with the weight but it's not worth your time or money -- ripped, not too size, and flimsy. Avoid this horrible tarp.

  This has been the worst tarp we have ever bought.  It is not waterproof at all.  AT ALL. We have been tent campfire 45 years.  We have even tent in hurricane conditions and the bottom of tent was never wet.  Broke camp today , 2 days ago it had rain the bottom of tent was wet so we had to open it up when we got home.  Waste of time.  Will try to find address for the company that sold this item to ask for a refund. Pls don’t order this item.  Sadly u have to give a star for product  .  Not happy about it.

1,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Fluidmaster 400CRP14 Universal Toilet Fill Valve and Flapper Repair Kit for 2-Inch Flush Valves, Easy Install",$9.95,5.0,"
  I purchased this Fluidmaster Toilet Fill Valve Kit to replace the original fill valve that came with my toilet (14 years old).  I had previously replaced the flapper a few times, but this time the entire fill valve was shot (Noisy, leaking & running).  My water bill was running about $5 higher than normal, so this new fill valve will pay for itself in less than 2 MONTHS!The install was extremely easy; taking only about 15 minutes.  The included directions are easy to follow; no tools are necessary unless the existing lock-nut that is under the toilet is a bit seized.  Before installing or removing any parts, turn off your water pressure at the toilet and flush your toilet to remove as much water as possible from the tank.  Any remaining water can be soaked up and removed with a sponge.  I always get a small bowl, or use an old towel under the toilet to capture any other small amounts of water once I remove the nut that holds the valve stem.  The new valve kit and flapper easily attached to the flush arm and fill pipe.  This is a very inexpensive and straight forward DIY project.Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews.  I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.

  Lasted about 6 months before the valve started leaking, Verified flapper seats properly. Then replaced it anyway.Tried inspecting, cleaning and flushing the valve seat as per the video. No help. Runs slowly but continuously through  the 1/8"" plastic refill tube. Then I discovered the following:If the plastic refill tube length extends down lower into the pipe than the full water level, this will create a siphon effect that will make water flow slowly through the refill tube and create the impression of a leaky valve.Do NOT reuse the existing refill tube, even if it appears to be OK. Use the supplied refill tube AND supplied mounting clip, and trim the tube length if needed. This will ensure that the refill tube doesn't siphon the tank and make the valve open. Look in the bowl and ensure that you don't see any water flow.I thin the valve design should prevent this, but it does not.

  What a huge relief finally no more leaky toilets around the house. Install took about 20 minutes including the removal of the old valve system, key thing to remember is to make sure you have teflon tape to seal the water line make sure the float mechanism has clearance to go up and down smoothly. I would recommend just testing the system before you put everything back together.

  I bought this to replace a fill valve that was dripping into the tank.  Our home was built 11 years ago and we've lived here for 9 years.This replacement was easy to install and seems like it does a reasonably good job of filling the tank and cutting off flow properly.  I do have a gripe with it, though.  At the top of the fill valve there is a filter to prevent small bits of debris from passing through the valve.  The problem I've had - three times now - is that when those tiny bits of debris are caught by the filter it locks the valve open and the water continually runs.The only way I have found to correct this problem is to pull the top of the tank, unscrew the valve assembly, use a knife or pick to remove the contaminant and then reassemble the valve.  Not difficult, but not something I've ever had to do with previous fill valves in this house for the past 9 years.  Having to do it three times in the two and a half months since installing this valve is less than ideal.

  First off, Amazon has the picture wrong on this. The 400CR is the newer version with the screw type float height adjuster..always, whereas the 400C can be the old (bar and clip adjuster) or new version because Fluidmaster reverted back to using just 400C some time after the design revision. I knew this when I ordered, but for those of you who care, there it is. I've had both the old and new and just prefer the newer design personally, but plumbers don't seem to care either way. They both function exactly the same way.This is by far the best designed, easiest to install and configure, and reliable fill valve available. I've installed it in each of my toilets over the years. It fills fast, fairly quietly and doesn't cause pipe hammer.I finally had to replace one (the older design) because it repeatedly started having issues. I'd had it in the toilet for at least 10 years anyway! First it started running, which was easily fixed with a cap flushing, but then water stopped flowing to the fill tube. The clog was down in the fill valve below the cap and did not stay fixed with a flushing, so I just decided to replace it. They only take a few minutes to replace and the cost is nominal.The flapper that comes with it is of good quality but I haven't used it. It can be installad on round or square fill tubes that have flapper posts on them. (A post ring for fill tube is not included. Looks like the picture of the black part of the flapper is wrong too. It does not have a fill tube ring. It is open ended just with hooks)My one toilet has a flapper with the timing cup on top of it and it's own drain seat insert that it's attached to (555CRP8, also made by Fluidmaster, 555C is the newest version) because the fill tube is too far from the drain and a standard offset on the flapper, as this has, wouldn't center and seal properly.The other toilet still has a firm gray one with a notched plastic ""chain"" that I installed separately years ago too. If they aint broke, I don't replace them! Flappers are the touchy part.In addition, fluidmaster provides excellent instructions for the DIYers like me, both in the package and on their website, including troubleshooting instructions. Top notch professional company.Highly recommended.

  I have purchased/installed/used two of these shower heads. I would highly recommend them to anyone that is interested.BACKSTORY:I'm currently renting a new place and I found myself really missing the shower head with a hose from my old home. However, since I'm renting, I didn't want to spend a lot of fixtures. Since this one has a decent price and good reviews, I bought one for my bathroom. Within two days, everyone in the house was fighting over the shower with this in it. I ended up buying a second one within a week. Here is what I noticed:PROS:- It looks nice (nicer than I expected for the price).- It came with clear/easy instructions for installation.- The installation was a breeze. It took maybe 3 minutes and didn't require a single tool.- I was worried I might not have enough water pressure for this to work well, but that was not the case. It works very well regardless of the setting. In fact, on some of the settings it actually seems to amplify the water pressure.- It is very easy to get the shower head in/out of the mount.- It is easy to change the settings.- Although it's not pictured, I was able to put my hanging shower caddy back up and the hose/mount doesn't interfere at all.- After about two weeks of multiple uses daily, it is holding up great.CONS:- I'm really stretching to find a con on this one. The only thing that comes to mind is that when I opened the box and picked it up for the first time, I noticed that it was made of a pretty lightweight plastic.  That made me question whether it was going to be a quality product. After using it the first time, that concern was relieved right away. This is every bit as good as the more expensive ones I've purchased in the past.UPDATE:After 4 months of daily use, both of these are still holding up great. We still love them as much as we did the first day.

  I purchased two of these shower heads. Initially, my wife and I were very happy with the look and function of this product. However, after ONE time of using the detachable shower head the hose began to leak. Thinking it was likely a defective product, we decided to order another one of these. This time, we decided to avoid using the detachable shower head to avoid any potential mishaps. Sure enough, a couple months later after ONE time using the detachable shower head, the hose AGAIN began leaking.Terrible quality, go to Costco and buy a shower head there for the same price and better quality.

  At first I thought this was a good shower head for the price. It has good water settings and easy setup, but I was wrong about the quality. It is poorly made, or I got a dud. After only a month and a half of use, the water started dripping out from the hose and it's a lot. To the point where the pressure coming out is very poor.

First job, remove any flow restrictors.Get yourself a pair of needle nose pliers and yank out two pieces at the shower head end.Optional: remove wire filter/screen at the other end.Installation was simple.The product included all necessary washers and a mini roll of Teflon tape.Follow the included instructions for a hassle free and leak free install.In use, simple to use the different modes are easily selected. I have relatively low water pressure but with those restrictors removed I have enjoyed some nice neck and back water massages.Bonus: Now I have a hand held unit rinsing and washing a dog in the bath tub is a whole lot easier too!Recommended.

  I got this item in a lightning deal for $15.  First of all,  assembly took 5 minutes.  Secondly,  remove the entire flow restrictor from the inside of the base of the handle.  This item works much better with a strong flow of water.  For some reason,  they have to put them in items like this,  it's perfectly normal to remove the water flow restrictor.  Hand tighten!!!!!!!  Do not use any tools!!!!!!!  The only tool you need is needle nose pliers to pull out all three parts of the flow restrictor.  Mine rocks.  No drips,  absolute quality hose and handle.  Very impressive highly polished gleaming chrome finish.  I love it.  Something of this quality at any brick and mortar store would be at least $40.  Amazon,  Thanx for the lightning deal!!!!!!!!!!!

   I was so excited to use this spot cleaner for small areas in my bedroom showing stains.  I didn't need a whole house steam cleaning system, I only had three small areas in my bedroom (I blame the kids or the cats, maybe both), that I needed to touch up, and based on the reviews, this seemed like the machine to do it. Initially, I had nothing but positive things to say about this product, the ease of use, assembly, portability, etc, until the results were in, and this machine did not remove the stains in my carpet.  Here are the details:WHAT I LIKED:-Assembly.  It was easy - just a few hose attachments to snap on, and your product is assembled, took less than 10 minutes.-Included items.  I liked that this product came with a 3-inch tough stain remover brush and a deep cleaning tool.  It also came with an 8 fl oz trial size Oxy spot and stain formula ready mixed for out of the box cleaning.-Lightweight.  I was able to haul this machine up and down stairs even with the water tank filled, no problem.  It weighed about 10 pounds, with the water.-When I emptied the water after cleaning the small stained areas (approximately 3 inches in diameter on my carpet)  water was filthy - I was pleased that it looked like it had cleaned something....however, read below.THE DEALBREAKERS:-It didn't get the spots out of my carpet.  They may be fainter, but they are not gone, and this is even with me pre-treating the spots and following the Bissell instructions to the letter.  Yes, the water was dirty, so I'm sure it did something, but I was expecting the spot (which was just grime, not nail polish or anything permanent) to be easily removed.  I've honestly had better luck using a spray bottle of Resolve carpet cleaner for less hassle than breaking this thing out.-Short hose.  15ft.  I was definitely on my hands and knees using this machine.  Not convenient perhaps for those who don't want to or can't crawl around on their floor.-Heatwave technology is advertised to maintain consistent water temperature while cleaning.  Let's just say the water was consistently tepid to cold throughout the cleaning and should be more aptly named Coldwave Technology.  Perhaps the lack of any water temp is why the spots wouldn't lift.-Spray nozzle.  The cleaning heads contains a spray trigger so you can spray the solution while you use the scrubbing tool. The spray didn't really go where I pointed it, and it ended well outside the area I wanted to clean.  It also soaked the carpet, taking 24 hours to dry these areas completely.-Dirty water tank hard to empty with one small drain plug.Disappointed that a name I've long associated with cleaning (Bissell) could make a product that frankly fails to live up to the basic job it was created to do - spot treat a carpet and lift dirt.  I'll be renting a whole house carpet cleaner instead.

  This portable cleaner is easy to use, and the suction power seems average, but it does not heat the water.  It is supposed to retain the temperature of the water you put in it, but it doesn't.  Hot water goes in, cold water comes out.  It also leaks water when you remove the clean and dirty water reservoirs.  Listen to the reviews that say don't waste your money.  I didn't, and now I'm two days past the date I can return it for a refund.  Don't be like me!  Just don't buy it.

  My dog decided that her new place to have accidents was going to be in my new couch. At first I bought some pet store products that would help with removing stains and odor. They kind of worked, not really. Then I decided to try “home remedies” with baking soda and basically ruined my couch. My next step was to call a professional...they quoted me $250-$350. So I did a little bit of research and watched some YouTube videos and discovered this amazing guy for a fraction of the price and figured I’d probably be needing it again in the future when my dog decides she mad at me and wants to let me know. 2 days later it was at my house and I was so excited to use it (I’m getting old).

  This unit consists of a spray nozzle and a vacuum. Any of the 'cleaning' is done by the chemicals and any elbow grease you apply. The plastic doesn't seem that durable so you should not be too rough in handling it. That said its compact, has nice aesthetic design, and also offers a self-cleaning attachment nozzle to clear out the hose of any debris.If you need something basic to clean some small stains then this should work out. If you're looking to do a thorough cleaning of a rug or furniture you should probably spend some more money and get a more powerful unit.

  I thought I can actually get a steam cleaner for under $400 and expect it to be good...But I'm pretty sure the only thing this machine did was make my rugs wet.Why I returned it:- Very short hose (like most people said) makes it awkward to maneuver.- imprecise spraying from tool Does indeed make more of a wet mess than it helps to spot treat.- water runs out too fast, which means the cleaning liquid does too.- the cleaning liquid did no cleaning: I had a few very light stains from cat vomit that were mostly gone from earlier attempts to spot treat and blot off, but I have light carpets and wanted a more thorough clean; this did nothing to achieve that.- Isn't the water supposed to heat up? It doesn't!

  If you like steam showers, this would work as the showerhead provides a mist and not a high pressure shower. As a showerhead, this was terrible. It leaked on the first use (see the drip in the pic), and because the water stream was only a mist, it took too long to rinse off. I will be putting my old showerhead back on.Update:Day 2 was worse.

  Ok, let me start off by saying that this would be an ideal showerhead if you have a completely tiled in shower, and glass doors. If you are using a shower curtain, and if you have drywall above your shower stall, you probably don't want to use this showerhead. Otherwise, if they could make this in a regular pressure, 2 GPM model, I'd be all over it.I have extremely hard water at my house. I will post a picture of my showerhead and how it looked before I switched it for this one. I always wondered what it did to my hair and skin but never really thought about a solution as I do not have a house water-softener system. I saw an ad on Facebook for a showerhead like this and it got me thinking. Then I saw this on Amazon for about 1/4 the price and decided I'd try it. We had to buy a shower hose and an adapter to put it on. It fit on just fine. The water pressure is SERIOUS on this thing. My regular showerhead is rated for 2 GPM for water savings, and I don't find it to be lacking in pressure at all. This head though... it must use MUCH more water, because the pressure is insane. The water pressure is so much that it causes the shower curtain to billow in on you something crazy. I even tried weighing them down with heavy plastic clips... it didn't help. To make matters worse, the water pressure is so strong that when it hits you, it also bounces back off of me in a mist and soaks my ceiling and walls above the shower. So between it going everywhere all over the place because the shower curtain wouldn't stay in place, and my ceiling and upper walls being soaked, I couldn't keep using this showerhead.I must say though, I could feel a significant difference in how soft my hair felt after showering with this filtration, and my skin felt different too. Not as dry and tight after a shower. I just wish they made it in a less intense version. So as far as softening the water, this definitely works as advertised, it's too bad I can't keep using it.

  I live in New Jersey and as everyone knows, the water here is hard water. I have been using shower head filters for a year already. It reduces the hardness of the water. This time, I replaced my regular shower head with this high pressure filter-type of shower head, and my water became cleaners. I tested it with a device and it shows 140 as the water cleanness level. Government says that water within 150 is safe to use. So I guess the combination of this new shower head and my old filter work very well.

  I kept seeing a similar item advertised on FB and my little girl has long curly hair and very low water pressure in her shower so showers were taking forever.  I went on Amazon and looked for something that looked just like the photo of the product I saw on FB, and this item does so even though it had a different brand name they looked identical.  I just popped it onto the hose on my daughter's shower, turned on the water, and voila!  WATER PRESSURE!  I just have to figure out how to turn on all 3 water flow settings because I only saw 2 . . .

  I didn’t think much of this shower head until I installed it. This thing has a lot of power and 3 different settings. It did have the leak at the connector but I think it could be fixed if I put another washer in the hose. I think it needs a longer connection, I think the end doesn’t seal good because it’s a little short.Anyway I loved the power and spray. It sprays hard but it doesn’t hurt. I think the filter really works well. It took away the smell of City water. My skin on my arms and legs started exfoliating and washing of the dead skin cells.This thing makes your skin feel tight and it gave me a super grip with my hands . After I dried off my skin felt abrasive and I could rub off the skin cells but now that I am completely dry, my skin feels very smooth. This thing really loosens up dead skin cells. There’s a callus on my thumb and now the skin is starting to flake off. I would have given this 5 stars except for the leaky connection, but I’m sure I can fix it by going with double rubber washers.The holes are so tiny like pinholes but it definitely puts out water. It does look it might break if you dropped it but we’ll see how it holds up.

  Was skeptical with the low price. I just received mine today, im dorky with purchases and had to try it out right away. Love this shower head! I can't give an educated review of the water quality with this shower head... I'll take it for what they say. However, the water pressure definitely increased way more than I expected. Big difference. Love the three settings as well, it has a mist mix that gives a softer feel with the water. And the jet is pretty powerful. Overall, I would definitely recommend this shower head to anyone.

  I like to use a lot of cast iron and stainless steel pans. But you know what's the worst? Burnt on oil.I bought these on Amazon because they were both cheap and well-reviewed.I expected these to be tough on my hands. They weren't.I expected them to fall apart pretty quickly. They didn't.I expected to have to use a lot of scrubbing force. I don't.What did they do? They removed the burnt on oil on my stainless steel pans and cast iron pans with a refreshing ease. You apply a little pressure and move it around, and the grease disappears. It might not even help to apply more pressure, and probably decreases the life of the scouring pad.These are cheap enough not to even give another thought to. Just put them in your cart and get them when you've spent enough to get an add-on item.

  We used the command hooks to hold curtain rods that we wanted to hang at ceiling height. You need to leave about a half an inch above the top of the hook to place the cover/hook over the adhesive strip,  which meant that we could not hang them quite as high as we desired. They also do not have much reach away from the wall so that the curtains slightly rest on the blinds on our windows.

  I bought 2 of these hooks and used them with the adhesive and my lightweight curtain rod and light curtains (which couldn’t be heavier than 3 lbs) fell down twice :( After using all the adhesive available in the pack, I bought a third hook for security and the 16 lb capacity picture hanging strips just in case, and two hooks gave out on me. The curtains fell on my face in the middle of the night, about 30 minutes after I installed them. I’ve attached photos of the failed hooks, in addition to the remaining trooper, valiantly still at his post.I would like to add that I’ve followed the instructions for the adhesives each time, leaving the strip to stand alone for about 2 hours and have had this fall down on me each time. My walls are neither particularly slippery or dirty in any way (this is a new apartment). Unfortunately, I am now out of command strips and hope. I hope this review helps someone.

  I purchased a set of these for a curtain rod across a single 36” bedroom window.  I don’t want to drill in a rod bracket.  I cleaned the walls (painted drywall) with alcohol and followed the instructions to a T.  After two hours, I placed the curtain rod with a single panel curtain onto the hooks.... 10 minutes later one of the hooks fell off the wall taking the paint with it.  Package says these hooks have a 5 pound weight limit but I can guarantee the rod plus the panel was about 2 pounds at the most.  So now I’ve got to touchup where the paint came off and figure out another solution.  I then decided to reuse this single hook with a new adhesive strip.  I followed the same exact instructions and put the hook on my laundry room wall.  This time it lasted an hour and a half holding a feather duster!!! then fell off the wall.  I don’t know if it’s the hook or the adhesive strip or what but I’m done using 3M products.  They cost so much and they simply don’t work as well as advertised.  I think I’m going to try Gorilla glue or tape instead.

  I purchased the large hooks for the purpose of hanging headphones on a wall. Of my headphones, the widest headband is about 1.5"". Given the dimensions portrayed in the one image, I thought I found a winning solution. In that image, it looks to me like the hook depth, so what I would consider the distance from the surface of the base to the inner side of the hook, is 1.625"". This is definitely not the case. That space I'd described is barely over an inch at most.If you are looking to hang anything that has width/diameter of greater than 1"" or so, look elsewhere. I'm giving 2 stars since they seem well made and relatively robust. Had I not obliterated the packaging, I would be sending these back.

  These were great to hang up a curtain rod. I was having issues drilling into the wall (you can see in the picture where I had to spackle over it) and thought I would give these a try. It was easy to hang up the rod and curtains by myself and prevent (further) damage. Just be certain to follow the timeframes about allowing the strips the adhere to the wall before putting any weight on them and definitely follow the instructions when removing or you might end up with a very sore hand.

  I really like that I can get this type of adhesive hook without it having to be plastic. Kind of wish I had skipped the ‘wipe the surface with rubbing alcohol’ part though because it made the surface of my door look funny. Seems pretty sturdy from what I can tell. The doors I put these on do have a bit of texture to them, and one is in the bathroom where everything gets all steamy a couple times a day, so I’ll update if anything changes. Also, I repositioned one (each hook comes with two adhesive strips each), and can attest that it did in fact remove easily and without damaging the door. If it had been stuck longer than about ten minutes that might have changed, but the experience helped me feel confident in the efficient removability anyway. So far, I’m very pleased with this item.

  I like the Command hangers in places where I need something more than temporary but not permanent. Or in places where I do not want to put a nail in the wall. They are better than suction cup hangers that fall off with changes in temperature in the room. These particular hangers are much larger than the medium hangers. They hold up well and do not mark the walls. This package had an extra sticky wall mount which was nice to have for if I need to move it at some point. The ding on stars is because of the price. I think they are a bit over priced for what they are.

  DO NOT BUY, BAD PRODUCT. Maybe you can use it for picking up clean things.  Dirt and pet hair stick on the filter and become crammed in to narrow slots around the  opening. Much too much interaction with the dirt. If you want to pick up spilled powder or dust or cold ashes it blows it out the back end. Also when you open it to clean the unwieldy handle doesn't lie down flat and rolls around. The last cordless vacuum I had from Black and Decker would automatically recharge when you put it in the cradle. I didn't re order that model because the battery shortly refused to hold a charge that lasted more than 1 minute. This one is hard to fit on to the badly designed cradle and then you have to mess around putting the plug in the vacuum the correct way. I hate it. I didn't use it right away so I didn't know how horrible it is so I can't return it. I will write a bad review as often as I think about it unless Black and Decker want to give me another model or my money back since I get angry every time I use it. DO NOT BUY, BAD PRODUCT

  I've only had this product a few days, but so far it's great. It has good suction and comes with two attachments (a brush and a crevice tool). The wall mount is really convenient too (you do need a drill to install it). I have limited counter space in my house, so getting it off surfaces really helps declutter. I bought this to replace a different model of Black+Decker handheld vacuum that would only have full suction for a few seconds after charging (after only one year of use). After doing research, I found that the problem lie in the battery. I kept my vacuum continuously plugged in, but apparently that is bad for the battery and causes the problem I was having. So for this vacuum I only charge if 3-6 hours after use then I unplug it. This one charges quickly and I haven't had a problem. It is super easy to empty and clean and so far I have loved it. I have used it to pick up spills, dirt piles from sweeping, kitty litter around the litter box, and dust on the baseboards. The only thing I could wish for is a way to store the attachments on the wall too.

  When I first unboxed the Black + Decker cordless lithium hand vacuum I was doubtful about the quality of the vac due to its light weight. In the box, along with the hand held vac, were two attachments, a brush attachment for furniture and stairs and a crevice attachment for confined spaces, a charging cord, reusable bag filter, vacuum wall mount and packet with two amounting screws and two plastic wall anchors.I switched the power switch to the “on” position to see how easy it was to switch the appliance from “off” to “on” and was surprised when the vacuum turned on because I hadn’t charged it yet.I was also impressed to find noted on the wall anchor and screws packet (2 plastic wall anchors and 2 screws come in each packet) the size of drill bit that I would need to use to make the pilot holes when mounting the vacuum’s wall-mount bracket.I charged the vacuum for about 20 mins before testing it out and was pleased to find that I was able to vacuum up all of the pieces of cat littler that were surrounding our cat’s box! I’ve had to drag our large floor vac out to deal with this in the past and am so happy I can now easily reach for the hand vac throughout the day! Removing the dust collection bowl from the vacuum unit was a snap, I only had to press a release button easily accessible on the top of the handle.I was also pleased to see that once I have mounted the vac on its mounting wall bracket I can keep it plugged in so that’s it’s ready whenever I need it! Also, the charger automatically reduces power consumption when charging is complete.I registered my vac, for the limited 2 year warranty, in a couple of minutes on the phone with a friendly customer service rep (also had the choice to register it online as).All in all, for the money, this vac was a great buy.

  This is the best model! I bought this and also the highly reviewed and more expensive BLACK + DECKER CHV1410L. The HHVI315JO42 wins! Honestly the suction side by side feels the some. Yes the CHV1410L has a longer and narrower build for small places but it is twice as heavy and the charger is a dock which takes up more space and prevents hanging on the wall. I find HHVI315JO42 model is narrow enough for my needs (plus it has a long narrow attachment) and the light weight makes it easier to use. It can stand straight up and sit on its butt while charging, or you can use the provided wall mount, as the charger is a small port in the handle. It's also much easier to remove the bag for cleaning. Wins in every category. Not sure why it's the cheapest as it's better looking and better functioning than other black and deckers. (I use it daily for kitty litter with the brush attachment and it's holding up well.)

  There weren't any filters in the dust buster. Took it out of the box, put up the wall charger and plugged it in. Went to use it today for the first time and discovered after a few minutes that my pants were getting covered in dirt. I took it apart and looked through the manual to see what was wrong. No filters. I tried to contact Black and Decker through their website but if there is a place to email them on the contact page, without registering a product I may not keep, I couldn't find it. If you have to buy the filters separately the description should warn you. It is also very loud. I do not know if this is because it was running without filters and dirt got into the motor. Unfortunately for me my Dad, trying to be helpful on recycling day, threw out the box. We had a good Black and Decker cordless vac for years which is the only reason I choose this brand again.

  I have had good experiences with TP-Link devices in the past, so I had high hopes for these little WiFi outlets, and they didn't disappoint.1) Setup was a piece of cake: just plug them in and use the Kasa app to configure them.  You can also control these by voice if you are an Echo user -- adding them as new devices is easily done through the Alexa app.  (They are also compatible with Google Home devices.)2) They are small and unobtrusive, projecting about an inch and a half from the outlet.  And because they are so compact, you CAN plug two of them in at the same receptacle, one above the other.3) They require NO HUB, since they connect via WiFi -- this is a huge plus!4) They are very easy to control with the Kasa app, which is well designed and fairly intuitive.  You can use the app not only to turn the plugs on and off but also to set schedules so lamps or other appliances turn on and off at designated times.I have had no connectivity issues with these, and I would certainly buy them again.  (In fact, I will almost certainly purchase more because I keep finding new places where these can be useful!)A tip for Echo users: I try to limit the number of different brands and makers of my smart home devices beacuse each brand typically has its own phone app and adds an extra layer of complexity to the whole setup.  But inevitably you are likely to have devices from several different brands.  If you like to set schedules and routines for plugs, lamps, etc., rather than using each individual brand's phone app, you can set all of their schedules using the Alexa app.  This greatly simplifies things, as you can look at ONE app to see the schedules of all of your different devices.

  I am a huge fan of these and I devised a plan to make it easy to remember what each plug is called to Alexa.  Having a sequence of words like “living room lamp” was tripping me up because sometimes I would accidentally leave out a word like room and my commands wouldn’t work.  So in each area of my house I have each plug labeled with a word that has a natural partner.  In my living room one lamp is Stevie and the other is Wonder.  In my dining room the two lamps are my grandmas first and middle names respectively.  And the bedroom lamps are named the same way.  This is much, much easier to keep track of, try it...and as a bonus it’s much more fun!

  I really like the TP-Link brand and this smart outlet is no exception. With this unit one can at least plug two (2) things in at the same time in the outlet (one smart plug and one regular plug or two smart plugs).... HOWEVER the smart engineer would have put the plug part of the smart plug on the side, top or bottom so that it didn't stick out of the wall 2""+ and with a plug... almost 4"".  That leaves the plug way out in the room if it is behind something. Great plug... poor engineering.

  I have an Amazon smart plug and these Kasa smart plugs by TP-Link work just as well.  Once you have the Kasa app installed, setup was a breeze and took me less than 2 minutes - including updating the plugs to the latest software version.  It is very well integrated and were discovered easily by Alexa w/o any hiccups.Once that is done, you can group them together however you like.  I even create scenes using geo-fencing that will turn on my kitchen lamp when I am near home.  I planned to use one of them for my Christmas lights.  This way I don't have to bother with the old timer like before.The plugs feels solid and high quality.  The side power button turn on manually with a satisfying click.  The Kasa is actually a little smaller the Amazon smart plug.  Long term, I have an older TP-Link plug I bought over 2 years ago and it is still working like a charm.  Haven't experience any disconnect from my home Wi-fi yet.Why get just 1 Amazon smart plug when you can get 2 of these for the same price, built, quality, and ease of use.

  I make a whole range of hot pepper sauces and I couldn't find the right size fermenting weight for a 1 Gallon glass jar. Or the weights were just ridiculously expensive. From the pictures these looked roughly the right size, were made out of silicone, were flexible, had holes to allow gasses to go through but small enough to hold contents down. So I figured I'd give it a shot cause worst case I have drains here too. Well, they work great for this purpose. I just run them through the dishwasher first, then use them in my fermentors.

  We have been struggling to find a hair catcher for our bathtub drain for a long time! Finally came across this and thought we might as well give it a try as it was pretty cheap and had good reviews. It was delivered today and I went to install it and got a little disappointed as it didn't fit right away as I thought it was taller so it would work with our drain. After messing with it a little and looking through other people's review pictures, I almost was ready to return it when I saw how shallow everyone else's drains were, but I thought maybe I should try cutting out the innermost dots to form a circle so I could stretch it around the circle on our drain and maybe it would work. I used my Cricut knife blade to cut from one dot to the next and ended up with a more hexagonal shape than a circle. I stretched the new hole around the top of our drain and now it works like a charm! Super excited that I could modify it to work for our needs. I was worried that our drain would still be too tall as it doesnt sit perfectly flush with the bottom of our tub, but when I tested it with the water turned on, it seemed to work really well! I will have to try it out tomorrow when I take a shower and see how well it catches hair but it works great for draining water through and now sits nicer on our tub!*Update on 4/9/21We have been using this drain cover for a few weeks now and it works amazingly! It is easy to clean and works great even in our taller bathtub. I have long hair and have had to clean it out a few times, which is good since it is actually doing its job! 10/10 for this product 😀

  Initially I really liked the colors and the material. However, I thought it was too big and the design too prickly. But after using it several times, I understood the design and I can say I really like it. I immediately replaced my old one which I really didn’t like. This silicone hair catcher performed efficiently!  Even if it moved a bit it  still covered the whole drain as it is quite large. It caught all the hair, both short and long. After use I removed the long hair and then followed the advice online and waited until it was dry. It was so easy to clean then.

  I was using metal mesh drain strainers for my tub and bathroom sink, but the mesh was too thin and caught everything, including spit when brushing my teeth (yuck). I needed to clean them after every shower, which was a pain, and even with that, they started molding after about a month. I decided to try something new, so I bought this product and it works well for the tub/shower, but they're just too big for the bathroom sink. These are like 5 inches in diameter. I'm also testing one out for the kitchen sink, but I haven't used it enough to decide if I will keep it there or not.For the tub, it seems to catch my long hair but I don't know how well it works on my husband's body hair. It seems like they might make it past the rubber nubs if there's enough water flow. I'm not really sure how to test it, but it doesn't seem to be filling up like the metal mesh one did. That does mean the tub doesn't start filling up towards the end of my shower like with the mesh one, which I appreciate. It stays in place well and is easy to move.For the bathroom sink, it takes up most of the bottom of my small curved sink. It stays in place even though the bottom isn't flat, but water builds up above the sides and sits under the drain cover, which has caused build-up of what I call ""sink grime"" after only a few days.For the kitchen sink, it fits nicely and stays in place well, and I appreciate it being soft and rubbery to protect dropped dishes a bit more. It seems to catch larger food scraps pretty well, but I don't know how often it will need to be cleaned yet.I would recommend this product for bathtubs so far, but I still need to see if I can test how much hair it's actually trapping.

  This doesn't stick to the bottom of the tub (I have tub/shower combo). I felt like an idiot trying to figure out if I was doing something wrong. Kept pressing it down thinking it should stick. I had to come back & look at product details to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong. Then I read reviews and really felt dumb because most of them complain about it not sticking. It floated on top of the water and barely caught any hairs. Cannot use this. Can't afford to clog up the pipes. Very disappointed because they look great.

  Take it from me, you do not want hair going down your shower drain, especially long hair.  Unfortunately for me, as huge as this hair catcher is (it's about the size of my hand!), I had to have my shower drain snaked after switching to this product.  Not right away, of course, but after using it for a year or so.  On its own, it does not prevent all hair from going down your shower drain, and you actually should try to prevent all hair from going down there, as I learned the hard way.  It is disgusting to see what all went down the drain and the gunk that builds up and sticks to long hair in a drain pipe.  In my case, this problem escalated to having a leak on the ceiling of our garage below the shower that had to be snaked, which was costly to repair.  The spikes are too far apart and hair can get past them easily.  Also, it gets moved around easily on the floor of the shower (there's no suction), so when it's off the drain holes and off to the side for a few seconds, hair sneaks right down.On top of this, I found that they develop mold, and I could not clean off the black stains from them.  No wonder they come in a multipack, I figured.  Anyway, so long and farewell to these ""hair catchers"".

  I bought this on a whim. I needed some raceway and wasn't sure about the size. So I went with the middle size (CC01). My TV is a Samsung QLED that only has a single optical cable to run all inputs and power. But I also have LEDs running behind it and another optical cable for the sound bar. Next to all this was 2 thin power cables from two Ryobi devices (a stick vac and hand vac). *See pictures 1-3* The T connector allowed for a lot of room to cover up any sloppiness. *Pic #4*  This raceway EASILY fit my extension cord, 2 power cables and 2 optical cables.  -But I also have another TV setup in this room and it has a power cable, as well as a HDMI cable (see picture #5). In that picture you'll see one think HDMI along with the power cable and I can easily fit a couple more.**For you all I decided to test this and grabbed 2 thick + 2 thin HDMIs, plus a power cord (pictures 6 & 7) and it all fit inside.After my installs I still have over 7ft left. So on to my family room I go.Pros:*Price*Easy to Install*Easier to cover up sloppy installs*Length*Different connectorsCons:None really... You'll need a good straight edge (and level) to install straight. Unless you are using a 3ft level you'll have a hard time installing it straight (without the straight edge)If this helped you please mark it as helpful so I know that it's worth spending the time to do longer reviews with pictures etc. Thanks

  I needed to conceal some not-so hot looking wires sticking out of my floor speakers leading to the tv stand. The plastic covers (concealers) seemed sturdy and well cut. The tape provided is really sticky; worked great. Be careful not to place the tape on the wrong place or it may peel off the paint if you try removing the tape from a painted surface. This happened to me. The only issue I had with the product is its poor instructions. The instructions provided on the package are vague. I tried looking for instructions online on how to attach the concealers but, I was unable to find any.After installing the concealers, I was impressed and satisfied with how well the concealers looked. I thought the concealers were going to stand out too much but, they didn't. I also thought the connections connecting the concealers were going to make the connections look ugly. I tried leaving the connections off but, it looked better with the connections (unions or whatever they are called).I have attached pictures of the before and after look. I definitely recommend giving this product a try. It is not expensive. It is definitely a valuable item to use if you want your entertainment system to look clean.

  First, if you believe that installation is as simple as the video indicates, I have a bridge in New York I'd like to sell you. On the plus side, I do like the final appearance after installation is complete (see attached pic), but that is purely a matter of taste. Fortunately, I did not need to repaint as the color fits well with our newly painted walls. I cannot comment on use of the adhesive as I elected to use the wall anchors instead. A simple matter of drilling two small holes in each piece and screwing into the wall. If I should ever have need to remove, it will be a lot easier to fill the small holes, fill and repaint, rather than worry about tearing up the existing finish. The instructions state that it is not for use on textured walls anyway, and I took them at their word. I only have one speaker wire and so this setup is more than sufficient for my needs. The down side is that one package did not offer a sufficient run, but I have no issue with  ordering another to finish the job. Summarily, take your time and use care while installing and the final result will look a lot better than exposed wires and I found the quality sufficiently acceptable as well.

  I ordered these cord covers as a, “I’m really sick of looking at all these wires! New year, new me! Let’s get some house to-dos done!” I received them and immediately procrastinated for about two weeks until finally I was sick of looking at the unopened box and just decided to tackle what I thought would be a project. Turns out the hardest part of everything was removing the protective backing of the adhesive used to keep the covers in place on the wall was the hardest part (I have no free edge to my nail so I had to use a butter knife to get the paper off the tape). It literally took me 5 minutes total to do the, albeit small, yet exposed section. Now I’m actively looking for more areas with exposed wires because A) I’m simply obsessed, and B) I have A TON of covers and angle clips, and tape, leftover. The only trick I can provide is once you slide the two parts of the white cover together, you need to make sure they kind of snap into place. And that’s it! So glad I found a modicum of motivation to finally cover my annoying tv cords!

  I bought this to hide several cords from my TV setup - including a set of three HDMI cables (on the left in the photo) and a power cord (on the right in the photo). Three HDMI cables are tight, but the room in the channel is sufficient. I received more than enough materials to do the job and could probably use the remainder to hide a bunch more cords elsewhere in the house if I wanted to. I got a little confused about the connectors, but Dulamo was very responsive by e-mail and provided assistance with installation (which is not particularly difficult). Good value, good product, and I'm happy with the results.

  So, as for the product working, these velcro zip ties are excellent.  They work perfectly.  However, it seems that a machine is responsible (as should be expected) in making sure there are 100 zip ties of the same length in the bag.  Here's where they are cheating.  The first tie to come off of each roll was different, one 2"", another 4"", a third 5"", but not the 8"" promised on the package.  At the end of the first roll there was another 3"" tie.  So, there are several ties in the package that are not as advertised.  Since there are three rolls in the package, this means that 6 ties are guaranteed to not be 8"".  This may not seem like a big deal to you, but if you can imagine how much money that velcro pockets from each and every person that buys these with their false advertising, you can see how that isn't exactly a moral way to go.  Fix your machines velcro.  Someday, someone will file a case against you and you will have a lot of explaining to do....

  I regularly purchase the Velcro One Wrap Brand from the big box stores in a five pack at $.70 for each tie or $3.50 for the pack.  When I saw the same brand on Amazon for $.08 for each tie, I was one happy repair guy.  Upon arrival, it's obvious that this is not the same product.  The strap itself is much less thick and not as ""grippy.""  As you know, Velcro is a ""hook and loop"" closure, and the ""loop"" portion (the side that feels fuzzy) is extremely thin on this product.  I had assumed that the ""Thin Strap"" in the name referred to the width of the tie, but it's the thickness.  So they still close, but they're just not as robust.  I'll end up keeping these thin straps due to the low price, but I'll still stock the hardware store's heavy-duty version for well... heavy duty jobs.  The photos below show the delivered Amazon product, the Hardware store product and photos of the two varieties of straps.  I'm sorry it's hard to see in the photos - it's very obvious when you handle them.Pros:• Excellent Price! (4 rolls w/ 25 8"" ties on each roll)• Velcro brand w/ simple system to attach to cords• Easy to tear off pre-cut rolls• Ability to double the length of tie by leaving multiple ties ""untorn""• Waterproof for outdoor workCons:• Thinner and Lighter than the Velcro you normally see• Easier to tear/break

  I'm a network engineer and I guess I am just spoiled by the thick and fluffy velcro ties we are given at work.  These ties work just fine, but they are paper thin and feel like I could tear them in half.  I think they will work in a ""set it and forget it"" type situation, but I wouldn't trust them to be reusable multiple times.  If you're the kind of person who changes your wiring around a lot, I'd look for something more robust.  If you're just tidying up and plan to leave it alone, these will probably fit the bill.

  Honestly...as ""Velcro"" is the originator and preeminent brand name, I expected a much higher quality. The material these ties are made of is EXTREMELY thin!!! So thin in fact they are easily torn in half even when trying to separate them from their self-contained coil. Do they work? Yes, they do keep cables together. My concern is ""for how long?"" The hook and loop is also very thin and non-aggressive. If I had to rate them for durability, it would be no more than ""Light Duty"" at best. Prior to purchasing these, I was buying ""dollar store"" knock-offs, which (as it turns out) are far superior in every sense of the word to these. Thank goodness they are so very low cost, which (in the end) should have told me not to set my expectations so high.UPDATE #1I've been using these steadily now for over a month. Am almost through the first spool of 25. My first reaction to their quality and durability may have been premature. Having wrapped and unwrapped many of them over and over, they still appear to be working fine. At this point I will raise my rating from 3 to 4 stars and change my classification from ""Light Duty"" to ""Medium Duty.""UPDATE #2It'd been almost a year. I just finished the first roll of wraps. None of them have failed under medium to heavy use. I cases where I needed a longer wrap, I've doubled them with no problem. My only suggestion to the VELCRO Company would be to die cut the straps a bit deeper. I loaned a few to another photographer. He too ended up ripping off the end by accident, rather than it cleanly separating.

At first I thought the arms were short & wouldn't be bright enough to reach where I hold my knitting. But that's not the case. The lighting is excellent. I like that the arms are short as one of my other lights has long arms & it's a pain to bend them up to light my knitting where I hold my work. And the others somehow shift as I'm knitting. These don't.  I like that they are rechargeable.  The adapter is a 'C', just like my Android phone which is handy. It comes with a cord. I use my own plug in adapter. I am so pleasantly surprised by these, I'm going to buy a back up & two more for my knitting friends as gifts.  I can't get over the quality of the illumination.  I can't comment on the battery life yet as this is the first time I'm using these. I wanted to get a review out right away. You will be happy with these. They look & feel well made. There is a small user manual. It explains the 3 lighting options. It says battery working time is 6-80 hours depending on mode & brightness. My husband likes to watch TV in our theater with no lights on. These are a lifesaver in that I can get knitting done in the dark. This light seems to concentrate the light so as not to be a bother to others nearby. Will test that when I get home & in the theater. Overall. I love this neck light. It's the nicest I've seen.

  This is a fantastic design. I was using a standard book light to read by, but wanted something else so I can knit while watching TV and not bother others with the light, and not have to clip it on to anything. Well, this is perfect. It has 3 brightness settings, is extremely comfortable and directionally adjustable. I ended up using it to read by as well, and got rid of my book light. Haven't recharged it as of yet, but it seems light a high quality idem.

  The Glocusent LED Neck Reading Light is the best reading lamp of its type. The availability and choices of light illumination are superb. It is not a heavy and gangly lamp, as some on Amazon are. The arms are of the appropriate length, they are very easy to manipulate, and the unit is well made and lightweight. The battery size and the length of use from each charge are the best of all the units that I see advertised. I first started with the Ledgle reading lamps, but when I moved to the Glocusent version I immediately realized how much better this reading lamp was/is for me. I  recommend the unit wholeheartedly. A worthwhile investment.

  I don’t have the best lighting in this house or the best eyes, and that makes for a hard time cross stitching.  These are absolutely wonderful!  I can see my patterns and do my cross stitching which is so great during this quarantine.  Be sure to charge every night after use though.  Thought I was going blind one time when I didn’t because the lights were getting so dim. ☺️  And they are so lightweight I forget I’m wearing them!  Highly recommended!

  I absolutely loved this light until I went to charge it! It caught on fire less than an hour after plugged in! Luckily there was someone in the next room when the light caught fire on the kitchen counter, and thank God it was on a granite countertop and not on a soft flammable area! I’ve never had a problem with any chargeable device until this. The stench is still lingering in my house as I type this. Very frightened and disappointed.

  I just bought this neck light and I absolutely love it. Do not look any further if you need one. It is comfortable, adjustable, adjustable brightness with or without filtration. I orinaly ordered it for my crochet/knitting hobby but it can be used for so many different applications.This product is not heavy on your neck and the angle of the lights is adjustable. I didn't find any downsides to this light so far. Highly recommend it.

  Wow. Game changer. I have to change my shower curtain liner a lot bc of a humid bathroom (yes, even with a fan on 😬). Though there are greater issues in the world, why wouldn’t you want to save yourself some time with these hooks!  Not having to take the curtain off each time I change the liner has really been more satisfying than I had anticipated. Added bonus are the rings themselves, the balls that were added hug the shower curtain rod so they never pop off. Something I never knew I needed either. Love these!

  I have been looking for a way to organize my girls' costumes. I had plenty of space on the closet rack, but hangers were too difficult for them to be able to clean up after themselves and it resulted in a pile of costumes all over the floor. I decided to give these a try and it's just what I was looking for. The closet rod was a bit too thick for the hooks, but I was able to gently bend them open just enough to fit. They stay on securely and move back and forth easily. I was able to fit over 20 costumes and I still have a few extra hooks left. Not the intended use, but perfect for what I needed!

  This is one of those items you didn’t know you needed, and once you get it you can’t help but wonder you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for multiple shower curtains. Buzzfeed made a list of must have items, and when I saw these I was like YES! The list was actually for Walmart, but Prime ships quicker than FedEx. I know you’re like, ‘It’s just shower curtain hooks.’ And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner, that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto you’re back watching videos online glad you caught that Buzzfeed one.

  Had an older set of these of different manufacture. I bent them open a bit to make them slide a bit better over the hump in my shower rod, and the metal broke after years of water exposure. These ones seem to have a bit more room in the hook. No need to bend. Seemingly sturdy, and truly flat black, not bronze. Great match to my other bathroom finishes. Definitely a challenge to get a whole room of flat black without dropping your savings on Kohler or something. Anyway, nothing else to say here. If you're interested, just buy it. You won't regret it. If you haven't had the dual hook style before, it makes washing your shower curtains really easy, and that makes me more likely to do it more often, so that's a win.

  They roll across my adjustable shower curtain rod well.  Item is great for those of us that have hand issues in terms of quickly removing the curtain liner for washing.  What I don;t like is the hook that holds the curtain liner is the same height as the hook that hangs the shower curtain - would be nice if the liner hook wasn't as tall so you don't see the liner from the front.

  We’ve been using auto sensor nightlights in our home for over 10 years. We started with bulb units and eventually went to LED as the technology changed.I have to say that these Vont LED nightlights are my favorite ones yet.  The unique rounded square shape adds a bit of character and I love the fact that the light, while nice and bright, has a matte finish quality to it giving it a warmer, softer, diffused style which makes it much easier on the eyes, especially when you wake up in the middle of the night.If I had one complaint, it’s that the light sensor (which turns in the light at night) is not sensitive enough and triggers the nightlight even when it’s light out .  In my basement I found that I had to swap the location of the nightlight because, while to my eye it looked like there was certainly enough light coming in during the day, there wasn’t enough actually hitting the sensor to turn off the nightlight because it was in a darker corner of the room.The unit is vey light  weight and can easily be placed in the socket such that the other outlet is not blocked and easily accessible.In the interest of full disclosure, I was sent a package of these for free in exchange for an honest review. That being said, I would instantly buy another package of these myself should the need arrive for more nightlights.

  I thought these might be good and useful.  I did timely receive them, so that was good.  Opened the box of six.  Got out the first one.  Nothing.  Got out the second one. Plugged it in and nothing from it. The other four seemed to work. And, yes, it was dark enough for them to have worked.  BUT, 33% failure rate out of the box is totally unacceptable.  Something is wrong with this product.  They are going back and I’m not buying these again.  I don’t normally write reviews, but this one is warranted.

  I absolutely love these night-lights! They are exactly what I was looking for. I ordered the soft white because I was wanting a softer glow. They definitely give off the right amount of light without being super bright. I love that they don’t block the outlet either. I can have this plugged in and still have the use of my outlet. Another plus is how low profile they are, not bulky at all. Don’t hesitate to purchase!

  I received the product from the vendor as part of a process to review the items for free but this is my honest opinion.Pros:1. Light is soft, white, and gives just enough for dark for places like a hallway or a bathroom.2. Devices are small enough to fit in almost any outlet space without taking up too much room.3. Checking the electrical usage on the light shows that it is using about as much as a standard LED nightlight (about 0.5 Watt)Cons:1. It does not use motion detection but that is a minor issue overall.2. It works on an ambient light sensor level, but because of such you cannot control it when placed into a windowless or dark location (such as a garage or a powder room) - If you enter the room it is on and when you flip the light on it is off. This makes the sensor no different than a standard nightlight.3. They feel flimsy. The product is good and appears to work well after a solid week of use but it feels cheap. This does not detract from its use but may make some people wary of where they put the item if there is a chance of any traffic.4. INDOOR ONLY!!!Bottom Line:For the price, this is a good item, especially when you get six at a time for one small pricetag. Aside from the overall feel of the construction and sometimes limited usage as a ""dawn to dusk sensor"" item, they are worth the time and expense. I have used Vont Products since they were known Divine LEDs and have rarely (if ever) had issues with them working.

  I purchased these ear plugs because I suffer from something called annoying neighbors syndrome. I'm not entirely certain of their activities, but I would liken the sounds coming from below and across from my apartment to that of an auto shop or a construction site, perhaps even an airplane hanger. It's particularly horrendous in the evening. Therefore, I have resulted to ear plugs to ensure I get a somewhat worthwhile night of sleep. The contour capabilities of these ear plugs make them incredibly comfortable to wear and the lime green color is particularly stylish, if looks are important while you sleep.... After inserting the ear plugs and allowing them to adjust, silence befell my bedroom. I was able to sleep free from the obnoxious noises that surround my apartment. My only complaint is perhaps these ear plugs work a little too well. I missed my alarm... by an hour and a half. For a full 90 minutes my phone alarm was ring-dingling away and the ear plugs blocked every bit of noise. After the initial panic of being late for work wore off, I was slightly amused that my neighbors had to listen to my alarm while I, for once, slept through their douchbaggery. These will be the only ear plugs I wear from now on. And I'm considering a louder alarm, so suggestions would be helpful.

  I read a review that mentioned that  a long time ""flents quiet time"" user (which is the purple earplugs) switched over to the ""flents quiet contour"" (high visibility yellow) because they were better in every way. So, I had just placed my annual order of the purple ones (been using for 4 years or so) when I decided to do a little research. I thought I'd  try these ""quiet contour"" ones, and see what was what. I'm a carpenter by day, also putting in a bit of time in a commercial cabinetry shop so these are a must. I was not impressed with the ""quiet contour"" ones. They aren't the same type of foam, these ones being more airy I'd say.... They don't expand to the same density. I tested them at the same time and the purple ""quiet time"" ones easily outperformed and felt better in my ear. They say they have the same noise reduction rating, but I see the green ones say, ""manufactured by MOLDEX"". Whatever that is, I'm guessing that is where the difference is. A pro-tip, and what sets these apart from the cheapo ones that most employers supply is that if you keep these in your pockets, they can go through the wash a couple times before they're no good. No sense throwing them away after one day's use...

  I wasn't sure about Flents contoured earplugs, and was fairly happy with Flents Quiet Time Ear Plugs, but decided to take a chance on them. After all, I've sold containers of 49-out-of-50-pairs of earplugs that didn't work in the past on that auction website we all love, and the contoured shape of the new ones seemed worth the risk.But now the days of carefully shaping earplugs multiple times to get them in the perfect spot are over, because all it takes to get Flents Quiet Contour Ear Plugs in is rolling them between my fingers so the inner part is narrow and the flared outer part is folded outward, sliding them far enough in the canal to get the bulge inside, and lightly holding it in place while the bulge expands, which takes maybe five seconds. In my case, at least part of the bulge gets past the narrow part of the canals in both ears, blocking out all noise except the sounds I need to hear while keeping the earplug from coming out on its own, and the earplug is long enough to be easy to remove but not long enough to stick out and rub against my sheets or pillow.As if always getting my earplugs in on the first try weren't enough, the Contour plugs work well for not two, not three, but five or six days! Granted, I have to push them in a little after the foam expands after the first three days or so, but there's no more angry jamming things in so far that my ears hurt by morning.I suspect this design could work for a wider range of people than straight or tapered earplugs, especially if they come in two or three sizes, but maybe I'm just lucky. If so, let me wish you the best of luck finding an earplug that works for you!NOW FOR THE CAVEATS:This won't be welcome news to many, but the external part of our ears is almost as unique as our fingerprints, so there is no such thing as an earplug that fits everyone. The outer part of the ear canal is made of cartilage which varies widely, changes shape when we move our jaw, and continues to grow and change as we age. And THAT means that unless you're very lucky, you're going to have to try a lot of earplugs before you find something that works well. I do recommend Flents Quiet Comfort earplugs as a starting point, but you may just have to try different kinds and brands before finding the right ones for you.Also, your sex, height, build, and the size of your outer ear won't tell you how long or wide your ear canals are. I'm female, 5'2"", and my outer ears are small and close to my head, but slim earplugs designed for women are too short and narrow for me.

  These things are great, they stick well, are removable, and work for a variety of things that need to be attached and removed. A couple of pro-tips:1. Don't place them directly on the corners (of say a picture frame) - they are a few mm thick when placed, and you will see them if they are in a hallway for instance. Place them a half to an inch in from the corner and it will help2. Stick them together, remove one side and place it on your object. Hold it up to the place you want it, get your spouse to agree (lol) and then remove the wall side paper exposing the sticky surface and place.3. If you got step #2 slightly crooked, no worries. Pry it away from the wall, releasing the velcro like attachment and re-place it where you like it. You can go a surprising distance to get it right in any direction.4. Buy more of these, you will find they are great all over the place - hope that helps!

  Here's the deal: I framed some of the art I wanted to keep. It's signed original art; not stuff I paid a fortune for, but made by friends who are artists and it's certainly not mass produced junk. So it's not light and fluffy. I had hoped that these strips would be practical. NOT AT ALL. I have been hanging up my pieces in my new apartment and I lost two pieces.

  I don't know what I did wrong, but these were an enormous failure for me.  The sticky backing was barely sticky, if you could even consider it sticky at all. So clearly the entire point of these is to have good stick. Without, it's pointless. I have double sided 3M tape my husband uses at work, that stuff is literally permanent. I know 3M can make serious adhesive. But Ic couldn't use that permanent of an adhesive for my project, which was to ""hang"" some spice racks. These spice racks  literally weigh MAYBE a pound. I forget if I got the Large or Medium strips here, but they each supposedly handle 6 lbs or  8-10lbs. I was more than covered which ever one I got.The strips went onto the rack nicely, bc they have flat backs. But the second it went onto the wall, it was as if I placed it there with afreaking paper towel as an adhesive. Fell right down instantly, into my hands. I was like um ok.  I played around with them a little more, and they just never took. The ""velcro"" looking plastic bits snapped together nicely, that wasnt the issue, I could tell that was solid. It was 1,000% the adhesive. Or lack thereof. Once I really was like feeling the strips I was like these aren't even sticky. Like what exactly would this hold? A piece of a paper? MAYBE?These were a huge fail and annoying to wait for to find out they were cr*p. I will have to use either an insanely serious adhesive or put in more screws that I just didnt want to put in.  Thoroughly unimpressed.

  I ordered three bags. The first two were fine; the backing peeled cleanly off every tab with little effort. Every tab in the third bag was defective however; none of the backing strips on any tab could be removed without damaging the sticky surface underneath. The failed third bag must have been very old, stored very hot, stored under pressure, or some combination of the above. Amazon refunded the defective bag, but what to do now? A failed bag in a replacement order of one would yield no usable tabs... off to Home Depot for more.

  What was I thinking? I bought this product twice before I tried it. I intended to use in many rooms with various light pictures. In my first attempt, I got  this very light frame flower picture to hang in the bathroom by placing multiple stickers just to be safe. It seemed to work and I was thrilled!About two hours after we heard a big noise and quickly discovered that the picture not only fell but also broke the toilet seat, dented a wall, scuffed the other wall and broke my picture. I am now left with two walls to patch and repaint, I will need to buy and replace the toilet seat and a broken frame that I had to dispose. Guess how much it cost me in terms of time and money?

  You have to wonder if the people who are burning these out have them overloaded. For example a single small room space heater... well I will let Consumer Reports tell you > The electric space heaters tested at Consumer Reports use 1,500 watts to fully power. So with an 1800 watt max outlet strip typical for a 15 amp unit means that you can only plug a limited number of additional things, hopefully drawing very little wattage if you do.I have been using the slightly cheaper model of this version from Belkin that doesn't have quite as much in the joules rating, and it has worked flawlessly since Dec 2017.I am mentioning this because I was put back by the photos of the holes burnt in them. I plug a lot of things into mine and there is never a problem, but of course that is a standard 46"" TV, or my 56"", stereo equipment etc. etc. etc. and it works without a whisper. I have a few space heaters in the house for emergencies and usually just plug them directly into the wall on a dedicated circuit. Space heaters are cheap and the threat of a lightning spike is remote but due to the price it is not a big risk. I'm not an electrician, but that is my two cents.I just bought two of these for only a couple of dollars more than my other one just like it. It has a few hundred more joules in the rating like 4 thousand some instead of 3900. Works great. If something goes wrong I will be back to update my review.

We lost our 50"" TV, a Nintendo Switch, and our surround sound stereo system. The electrician who came to fix other damage caused by the lightning said these power strip surge protectors are useless. Apparently he is right. We read about the Belkin $300,000 warranty, but from what we've read, Belkin makes it very difficult to file a claim, and so we have decided to just file with our homeowner's insurance instead.If you are just looking for some extra outlets, I would suggest buying a cheaper power strip. If you're looking for something to protect against lightning strikes, you can forget this power strip and probably any other. Our electrician suggested we buy a whole house surge protector, which costs about $350, and so that will probably be our solution after we do some research on a reliable brand.. We certainly won't be buying anymore expensive surge protector power strips. This one at least was worthless.

  This is the third one of these that I've purchased, and the manufacturing level has dropped in a big way.  The first two I bought over a year ago and were solid/sturdy.  I bought this one a week ago and it arrived in a misshapen box.  Misshapen because whoever put it together decided that the on/off switch didn't need to sit straight on the plastic casing, and then just tried to screw it together anyway, bending the plastic casing and leaving the switch ""sorta"" on there.  They shipped it like that.  Obviously was not inspected by anyone.Amazon was cool and immediately sent me a replacement, but the replacement is of the same generation and is quite cheaply manufactured.  It functions as an on/off switch, but I wouldn't trust it to do anything else.  And I can't safely open it to verify the integrity of its internal components because the screws they use are single-use.So, yeah, pay attention to what you're buying here.  The price is cheaper than it was a year ago, and the quality of manufacturing has also decreased.

  Piece of JUNK!I live in a suuuper old house, like predating the Civil War old, so I bought this power strip for the Belkin name and the fact that it cost more than your run of the mill $8 ones you pick up at the store and may fair better with my old faulty wiring.You'd think for double the money it would be better right?WRONG! After only three months I just found this thing with a melted hole in the back and a big black spot on my wall where it exploded.I've had power strips from 1988 that've held up longer!

  The dual powered USB ports don't offer 2.4 AMP/12 W as advertised. The unit I received gives 1 AMP/5W for both USB ports combined and I verified it using Battery Pro app. When a device is being powered from one USB port, the 2nd USB port does not offer any current due to the low wattage on this unit. This is either false advertising or I received an outdated equipment.The second minor issue I have with this equipment is the power sockets are too close to each other, so any wider power adapter will cover the adjacent socket.

  This power strip has all you need. It's got plugs galore. It's got usb plugs that charge fast so no need for plug box. It's plugs are spaced out so there isn't any wasted space. The wall plug comes out sideways so no need to worry if you have a couch against it. It has everything thing you would want. I have it on my table by my chair to charge every I need. It can go on the wall with screws, nails, or even command strips. It even has a nice thick cord with no fear of short.

  I just got this power strip and right off the bat I liked two things about it - the cord (it isn't stiff and hard to bend!) and the ease of hanging it on the wall.  And speaking of hanging it on the wall - it comes with the screws to hang it.  My other power strips didn't.  I turn all my things off at the power strip when I am done in my sewing room daily.  I wanted the strips to hang on the wall to make this easier on my older knees.  And I didn't want to be trying to measure and guess where I had to attach screws to mount this.  I liked this so well I got a second one.

  This is exactly what I needed it to be. The USB ports were a must and this has 3. The flat head on the plug is a bonus. I was able to push my dresser back and minimize the gap. It comes with the ability to mount and as soon as I get my office arranged the way I want it, i will be doing just that.

  have a heavy printer on a stand with outlet directly behind it. Added an expansion outlet for printer and other items. Printer cable and another are very thick with very deep plug ends. So my stand would be a good 5-6"" or so from the wall. Always something falling behind it and the only way to get it back was to move the printer (80#) and the stand (very heavy). AAAAGGGHHHH!I chose this over flat outlets because I'd still have the depth of the thick cord and plug in. This item has a 'flatter"" plug than most. And I can set the strip on printer stand and plug everything in. It is close enough to the wall I don't have the worry of anything dropping behind it. And I love that it has surge protection and USB ports, very handy. Eliminates a few items I'd had plugged in and I don't have to charge phones and tablet one at a time because their plugs take up most of outlet space. Being long makes it easier to plug in odd sizes, I can still use the other plugs. And it feels very solid - I'm happy with it.The only thing that would make it perfect, is to make this so it plugs in with the cord running UP instead of down. Every place I have space trouble needs the cord going UP not down.

  I had a pretty significant hair clog in my shower.  I had tried chemicals.  Didn't work.  I ignored it.  Didn't work.  Ignored it some more.  Started to get slimy (don't judge me).  Saw this on amazon and that more than 2000 people had tried it and actually reviewed it, so I thought I'd give it a go.Oh my goodness.  This took no effort - I pushed it down the drain and it immediately caught something.  What came out was so disgusting, so vile, so yucky that it should have it's own X-Files episode.  Before it could lift it's head up and start quoting from the Book of Revelation, I put it in a plastic bag and dispatched it to the firey depths of hell from whence it was birthed.  Let some children dig it up in a trash pile in 500 years to have their future told.  I wanted nothing of it.My shower pipes were still praying ""The Angelus"" when I left for work.  If you have a nasty hair clog; wait until it gets slimy and reaches sentience, dig it out with the Drain Snake Hair Drain Clog Remover Cleaning Tool, then send it back to the Dantian blaze it calls home.  It does the job and well.

  I’m so excited to finally have a bathroom sink that drains!! Since moving into my apartment, my bathroom sink and bathtub took forever to drain. I bought Multiple De-clogging solutions but they didn’t assist or help much with the problem. When my bathtub was taking over an hour to drain I decided it was time to try these out! After receiving it I went to work, within minutes it pulled out so much hair in both drains. it’s disturbing/disgusting yet weirdly satisfying because now my sinks drain!!Cannot believe how easy it was to use, (I received a pack of 3) but only needed to use 1 for both sinks.CAUTION!!! pictures are graphic and disgusting but you need to see how incredibly well these work!

  I live in an apartment complex and the maintenance people are pretty strict about not using drain cleaning chemicals but rather calling them to unclog a slow draining bathtub or sink. However, I have pretty long hair and I'm certain that the maintenance people don't get paid well enough to go up against the horror that's been building up in my bathtub drain over the past several years.When I got the Vastar snake drain cleaner I went straight to work. No instructions needed, the concept is pretty simple: you grasp the tool with the end that's a handle, push the pointy end down the drain, and the jagged part catches on the nest of hair that's swirled it's way around your plumbing. I didn't even get the thing 3 inches down before it was getting stuck on clumps of hair and built up gunk. I gagged my way through getting all nausea inducing blockage lurking in my bathtubs drainpipe cleared out.It's now clear to me why this is a 3-pack.... There was simply no way I was going to be cleaning off the plastic tool and reusing it. Very happy with this product, glad it comes in a pack.

  I had a slow drain in my bathroom sink.  I tried all the home remedies first, bleach, baking soda, vinegar.  Then I overpaid for some Drain Stix which were completely worthless!  Then I stumbled across this Drain Snake.  Hallelujah!  My sink drain is one of those ones where you can't pull the stopper out.  I slid this drain snake down through the slit between the stopper and the drain, twisted and I swear to God I pulled out the equivalent of a cat!  I pulled so much hair out of that drain that I could've made a clip on ponytail!  The drain immediately returned to its original unclogged efficiency!  A plumber wanted to charge me $150 just to come out and take a freaking look at the problem!  I can't believe how well this thing worked.  I was so excited about the results that I just went and serviced every drain in my house!  You have nothing to lose by trying this great device before you call the plumber!

  These were perfect for a clog in my shower and sink. I have very long hair so naturally my shower got clogged and I was standing up to my ankles in water every time. I was skeptical of how well these would work but decided to give it a shot instead of pouring chemicals down the drain while keeping my fingers crossed. It worked wonders! Though I didn't have much stuck in the drain, I got it out and cleared it completely.If you get resistance, you need to be patient and keep wiggling the piece around until you break free - I can see it snapping easily if you pull too hard. Be very careful too, because the barbed parts are quite sharp and that's indeed why these work so well.Same advice as others: get a trash bag ready! I recommend also wearing latex gloves if you can because it's difficult to remove the stuff off the barbs once you've pulled it out (if you plan on going back into the drain to remove more.)

  You Get  3 For The Price Of One - EXCELLENT PRODUCT - I ordered these as an add on and with the price point I had little expectations of this working ..... But though I would give it a try before using harmful chemicals in my bathroom sink drain.I was VERY surprised!  My drain cap does not come off yet there are 4 or 5 slots which I was able to put this snake de-clogger down.I was very impressed with the flexibility and ease of getting the snake into my drain openings and what came out ..... Lots of hair and gunk.As some of the readers stated ""this was junk"" I DISAGREE.... The snake gets caught on some gunk and yes it will pull and the orange teeth like may bend ....BUT ITS WORKING!I would highly recommend this item. I was SO HAPPY I decided to give this a try and I'm glad!You get three snakes and they are re-usable - depending on your initial drain clog - the first one might take a beating .... But you have 2 more to spare.I think I will use this monthly as part of my maintaince cleaning .....My 18 year old son was able to.do this with no issues ..... I highly recommend this product.It's MUCH cheaper then a 200$ plus plumber visit.

  This fit my daughter's whole room up by ceiling on wall like she wanted and we still had a tad left. I was shocked at the price for 50ft in all of it. Only thing is I would also add the adhesive on the strips to make sure it sticks if it's for the wall. We at first stuck it on without the extra adhesive and it fell down at night but now it seems to be staying up when I got extra double sided tape at the store and put it on. Colors are great and looks great. My daughter is happy.Also I don't know if others had same issue but I always read everything on box to make sure it's the correct product. The box doesn't say 50 ft on it like the picture says and I got confused and thought I got 16.4ft only like it said on box. I was actually going to return them disappointed but then luckily I looked back at the picture on here and the box I had and realized it also said 3 after 16.4ft. So it's 3 rolls of 16.4ft LED lights! Lol! Dumby me! Luckily I caught it before I returned them.

   I honestly bought these expecting them to be really bad, like how can almost 33ft of rgb led lights be this cheap without being bad? I’m thoroughly impressed! The lights are very bright / very dim depending on what you’re into, the colors look amazing, and the setup was extremely easy! I wanna go into depth about each and every thing I took note of but I apologize if my writing isn’t the best, I’m not an English major or anything lol.Shipping and Handling: The product came very quickly, it only took two days and I don’t even have prime shipping! The box was neatly packed with airbags for padding and the product came in pristine condition! All of the things included were neatly packed in a small box within the shipping box and they give you extra adhesive and pins if you ever need them!Build Quality: The product seems to be sturdy enough to be tugged a bit, I had used a bit too much force when I accidentally dropped something while installing the lights but no tears or breaks were found. The lights themselves are very nice, they produce color nicely and have a wide range of modes and settings you can adjust to your own liking. The product includes a IR remote for led control but I believe there is an app as well. The remote is perfectly fine, it’s a bit generic in terms of build quality and features but I mean... why change something if it’s not bad? It has 15 different colors to choose from and has extra buttons for everything from fading (as seen in video) to sound activated (it’s really cool!) you can change the brightness and even the way in which the colors flow and has programmable buttons to keep the settings you like. I will say though, that the lights themselves did smell a bit weird, like a plasticy smell. It’s not an issue though since it seems that the smell is only temporary as it’s slowly starting to fade but thought I should let you know. The only other complaint I have is the adhesive and short cables. So I have my lights plugged into the side of my bed and installing them was a pain, I had to constantly re-apply the adhesive near the beginning of the strip and then ended up just using clear tape to fixate it to my wall which worked perfectly! I’m not too upset or anything though, it’s not really a big deal especially for how much I paid. The short cables caused a lot of strain on my lights and they would constantly unplug but my tape fix also solved that issue, isn’t it great that little things can go a long way?Final thoughts: Honestly, I could not be happier! I paid what, like $13-16 or this? And they’re awesome! I love the way they make my room look so much nicer and I like the sheer amount of customizability. I had a little hiccup during the install process but it was 100% worth it. I love these so much and so do the rest of my family, I’m actually ordering my parents two more as I write this! I would definitely recommend this to everyone who is looking into nice and affordable lights!

  These lights are fragile so definitely take your time with the application process. If the instructions are followed correctly they’ll look great. If you’re putting them along your ceiling edge around your room you will need an extension power cable for either the 12volt AC plug or an 12volt extension cable for the other end since the plug they provide’s cable length is way too short.

  My drier was taking several cycles to dry a load of towels. I cleaned out the larger vent areas but couldn’t reach in at the lint trap. I ordered this item. I got quite a bit out. The fact that the tube was folded in packing caused a little trouble. It seemed to have a mind of its own when I pushed it down in there. But I was able to work around it. I took out the six screws holding the lint trap in. I would never do that again. I thought I would never get it back on, and it didn’t helpthat much. Other reviews talk about the fact that this item is just a nozzle and a tube. That is correct, and it probably cost very little it make. But you are paying for the idea. The cone fit tightly right on my vacuum hose. I don’t know of any other way to clean this out. The brushes you can buy just knock the stuff down. I wanted to pull it out. I am happy with this and would recommend it for purchase.

  At first, I went to a big box hardware store to try to make something like this but the price quickly added up to more than what this item costs so I decided to order this. And I am super glad I did. Our name brand dryer is only about a year and a half old and we empty the lint trap after every load. I hooked this product up to our vacuum and couldn’t believe how much lint, dust and debris it pulled out! This product is well worth the money, easy to use and will pay for itself in the long run by maintaining the efficiency and drying power of our dryer.

  I saw this product was recommended by Consumer Reports for cleaning out the dryer lint vent. It was amazing how much collected underneath the trap, even with cleaning it out before each load. This easily connected to my Shark vacuum hose and allowed me to remove years of dryer lint with little effort. If the tubing was a little more rigid, removal probably would have been even easier, but I was able to sort of nudge the end of the tube where I needed it to be directed with the use of a paint stir stick. My dryer is back to running a whole lot more quietly and with shorter dry times. Definitely recommend this product!

I had bought a long thin vent brush several years ago which I used to scrap the walls of the vent, but I could not collect the fine material I brushed off.  You can see, hopefully, that fine combustible material easily was vacuumed up today!  Even found a button I had been unable to match previously!  I am delighted!

  I just used the exacto knife for this small project, but if I were covering a larger surface, maybe the smoother pieces would come in handy.It makes sense to have another person to help you with projects bigger than this. And DO NOT remove the paper all at once before applying. This should feel obvious to you, but I can see getting really excited about getting it on the surface (like a wall) and not waiting for help or planning how you’ll work together. You’ll want to start at the top, not removing the backing of the paper, and just slowly apply it, working your way down and smoothing as you go along. I suppose if you feel you’re good on what you’ve put up so far, you could carefully cut off the backing so it doesn’t get in the way and continue working your way down. Just go slow. If you don’t do these things, you’ll be cursing, and in a real mess, your paper ruined. It’ll get stuck to itself like scotch tape when it gets stuck on itself and you try to flatten it out ... which usually works with a few inches of scotch tape, and if it doesn’t, no great loss. You just don’t want it to stick to itself because1. The sticky part of this paper is more sticky than scotch tape so it’s going to be really difficult to flatten it out2. If you DO flatten it out, it’s going to show the folds it had while it was stuck to itself3. It will lose the strength - like scotch tape - of its sticky backing, and won’t adhere well4. It’ll make you crazy and you’ll feel so disappointed5. You paid for something you rendered useless and you probably won’t get a refund (MAYBE you would, but I’d kind of doubt it. You’d have to send it back looking like you did what you did, you know)?If your project is a big wall mural, I’d have a FEW people on hand to help, just in case. And save the wine for AFTER you’re finished! :) Just sayin’.

The red and blue tools are made out of plastic, which do the paper doesn’t tear, but the cutting knife would catch on it every time I was using it to cut a straight line. Also the roller is too hard. They make silicone ones that are much better. The knife was sharp and comes with extra blade and that is handy. Also the blue tool has a felt back on it and makes it easy to smooth out the paper. So. Two plus sides and two negative sides

  My first time using 'peel and stick' wallpaper. The tool I use for regular wallpaper would not have worked at all. The velvet end of the small tool was superb for getting the edges perfect, Used the larger tool to smooth things out as I was peeling the back from the wallpaper ~ worked great. The knife cut really well for a large wall I only replaced one blade so I have several unused.

  I was redoing our old dresser's with a nice wood look contact paper and purchased this kit to do it with. I've completed one large dresser so far and have not even had to change the blade yet. Works great! I have only used the smaller scraper that has a soft felt like edge as the other large plastic one would have scraped the paper. The soft edge one works beautifully! I'd recommend this kit, it's been very helpful to me with my project!

  Worked very well for my first time with wall paper (paste the wall) ... Only reason I gave it a star less is because the red blade thing never worked, the blade won't slide out and the roller was Har plastic which wasn't of much use. The only thing we used was the blue squeegee, the red flat thing for cutting guidance and the cutter for cutting. Just these 3 were more than sufficient. It would had been better if they were selling just these with a slightly lower price... That's my two cents. But the kit does it's work so I am satisfied.

  I used this tool set to do a kitchen adhesive backsplash and the squares were 12"" x 12"". That's a lot of super sticky material to work with. The blue smoothing tool was my lifesaver in preventing bubbles under the squares and having to pull the sheets off the wall to redo them. The blade was simple but effective to use. I didn't really use the red tool that much because the blue did the trick, especially with the felt edge, but I'm sure I'll use it in the future. Fork over the $6, it's worth the peace of mind you receive using it.

  I wish I had this kit sooner! Def using it again for all my future wallpaper/contact paper projects.I debated between the basic kit and updated kit and went with basic because I wasn’t sure if I would need it but I’m glad I did because the blue tool is good for pushing into wall corners/corners in general.I bought peel and stick wallpaper to use and it was really thin so applying it with this was still a slight pain (should’ve bought different wallpaper) but the end result was so worth it; I imagine without this kit I would have thrown all the wallpaper away and quit!Buy this kit if you are working on projects that these tools can help! So glad I read other wallpaper reviews who mentioned this.

  I wanted to make sure that the corner protector actually lasted before writing a review. Previously, I have purchased a foam one where it worked on most of my furniture except for my mostly metal dinning table. I am delighted to say this one is a keeper!1. The corner protector is strong enough that my toddler is unable to just take it off.2. It’s clear and minimal so it is visually pleasing to the eye compared to the other options out there.3. This protector has kept my toddler cry free!!4. As seen in the photo. There is no bottom part for one section of the corner protector to stick on. I used the widest part on the metal instead of at the base (where there is nothing to stick on). I have no issues with it. Yay!!

  These work great to protect people's knees from the corner of my glass coffee table. (Actually had to haul out the bandaids at a party). Yes you can see them, but they are pretty unobtrusive and don't interfere too much with the sleek look I wanted. Would be a little better if they were a bit more shallow, but I think they are made for a thicker table top than glass.

  Time will tell if these will stay on in an outdoor environment. I like the fit and they don’t look too bad. Whatever it takes to save our knees from the sharp metal corners! I didn’t have much trouble installing these, just notice that there are three unique stickers that only fit on one surface. Also, I recommend using a razor blade to carefully peel the cover off the sticker. Be confident, steady and take your time when putting the stickers on the protector and especially when fitting all three surfaces at once to your furniture. These are made to stick really well, so if you have stained or painted wood furniture they may not be the best choice. Maybe you could use these with command strips if you don’t want to damage your furniture.

  I needed something for my art table's sharp edges, but did not want it to look like I was baby-proofing my studio.  These are prefect!  Clear and barely noticeable, and they do a really good job.  They go on easily, and stick really well.  They don't stick out far like other edge covers I have tried, which is perfect.  They are clear, too -- not foggy or off-colored, so they do not interfere with the look of the furnishings. I am really pleased with this product.

  Purchased to cover all sharp edges to keep my newly blind dog safe.I looked at what seemed hundreds of corner protectors and chose these in the end based on reviews, price and because they are rounded.Can you see them when installed? YESAre they even a bit unsightly? Who cares! My dog isn't gouging out her eyeballs so we're more than satisfied!NOTE: Pay attention to the shape of the adhesives and be sure you're applying to the correct section of the protector.Would recommend to anyone. IMHO, much safer to use rounded protectors than rubber 'sharp corner' protectors.

  I ordered round and angled. I ended up using the angled.I had to use the upside down on the bottom half because of the way the piece was made.Found it time consuming to take the paper off of the glued areas. You have to be careful not to pull the glue with the paper. They did provide a large piece of 3M adhesive in addition to what’s on each piece. You just have to be patient and have a fingernail to pull off the paper. It wasn’t a big deal but, it would have gone faster if it were a better application.

  Rounds out the sharp corners of my coffee table without making it look tacky. My 1 year old has tried to take them off, but gave up after a few unsuccessful tries and now doesn't even bother with them. I am very satisfied because she just learned how to walk and would use the table to pull herself up and I was a nervous wreck. So now I have one less thing to worry about! Oh, not to mention it comes in handy when I accidentally bump into the coffee table myself! Shin saver!! Lol it was super easy to install. Just peel and stick! Literally took me like 10 mins to do 4 corners.Thank you!

  I thought the price was too good to be true but I trusted the Camco name as I've had very good luck with their products in the past.  As soon as I got this out of the package and ran my fingers around the threads I pricked my finger on one of the machining burs.  However I thought I'd make the best of a bad deal and tried to clean up the roughness with some steel wool but  it didn't help it much.  I installed it my system and turned on the hosebib  water started spraying  out at all angles.  I then tried using plumber's teflon tape to wrap the threads but even that didn't stop all of the leaks.I went back on the Amazon site and took another look at the Elbow using the magnification tool and you can see all of the  pits and the ragged edges in the metal,  I wished I had done this earlier but I was relying on the Camco name,  I could have saved myself the trouble of having to send this piece of useless metal back.

  I bought this 2 months ago and it's already fallen apart. I've only put my hands on it a couple of times when moving my RV. Today I went out to find it leaking a bit, tried to tighten it and it broke. You can see the retaining metal was super thin, and I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did. There's barely any material there. Maybe this one is a fluke, but it seems poorly made to me.

  these are well made solid brass 45º elbows... however the PLG Garden Hose Elbow Connector which comes in a 2-pack for $11.99 is almost exactly the same except without two little wings on the rear part you tighten - the PLG elbows have a typical standard hex-nut like premium hoses have on the female end... i ordered both the Camco andf the PLG 2-pack and see no difference in quality - unless you like the two wings for tightening...ALSO if yours leaks around the swivel as mine did the rubber gasket that comes with it is not big enough and it won't seal against the male hose bib... when i say the rubber gasket is not big enough - i mean the inside diameter of the hole in the gasket is too large, and it also seems to be made of flimsy rubber that gets chewed up when you try to tighten it... just try another standard rubber hose gasket with the inner hole a slightly smaller diameter - and that stopped the leak for me...works perfectly now...

  This is the perfect accessory for the Camco Pure Taste water filter if you are filling your fresh water tank from the side of your van/rv  thru a garden hose.Attatching this between the fill nozzle with the cut-off valve  and the filter removes the need for you to stand there holding the filter in a horizontal position so it wont break.You put this on and now you can insert the nozzle into your filler inlet and let the filter hang by itself on the side of your vehicle. No more stress on the nozzle or you!It has a nice all brass connector with wings for tightening onto the  nozzle end, and should last a lifetime.A must have item, and a steal at this price!

  I didn't like the idea of having a water hose hanging off our camper with gravity pulling on it all the time. I knew over time the hose would weaken there, about an inch or so down from the fitting and it could lead to leaks or a bend that would become a permanent restriction in the flow of water. Even with the hoses with the metal frames like the one we have will eventually have early wear. There's also a lot of tension on the fitting connected to the camper no matter what, but giving the extra stability of this 90 degree fitting makes me feel more confident.  We attached ours to a quick connect and keep our set up exactly intact for quick setup no matter if we are using city water or filling our potable. What's great with keeping this fitting on the hose for potable fill is that the 90 degrees is absolutely perfect to have it hang just inside the fill hole on it's own while you're filling up. That means I can be working on other things while filling our 2 tanks which takes a decent amount of time when they are empty. Such an inexpensive way to prolong the expensive parts you'd rather not need to replace.

  Thanks to Roger, my trusty plumber, and the Camco hose elbow, I drained the sediment from my hot water heater for the first time today.  As a new homeowner in May 2015, I thought I could forget about the water heater after I had it replaced.  Then last February, I ran across a home maintenance article that said a new hot water heater should be drained every six weeks for a few months, that every six months to 1 year.  Since it already been 9 months since the water heater was installed, I worried that I had damaged the hot water heater by neglecting it.Fortunately, a call to Roger solved the problem immediately.  He recommended draining the hot water heater once a year, including during this early period, so I could wait until June 2016 to do it the first time (but I did it early to be safe).  He gave me these instructions that were extremely easy and effective:1.  Do NOT shut off the water valves going to the hot water heater.2.  Connect a garden hose to the spout at the base of the tank, and run the other end outside where a large amount of water can drain.3.  Use a flat head screwdriver to open up the valve (90-degree turn) at the spout.4.  Let the force of the water pressure drive out the sediment for 15 minutes.5.  Close the valve at the spout using the flat head screwdriver.6.  Remove the garden hose.It was as easy as it sounds except for one detail-- the wall of the drip pan holding the water heater was high enough that the hose would have crimped over the edge.  Thanks to Amazon, I found the Camco hose elbow that would give more than enough height for the hose to clear the edge of the drip pan.  The Camco's connector allowed perfect positioning of the elbow vertically, and a similar connector on my Flexon 50-ft hose made the exit connection just as easy.  By luck, the hose was exactly the right length to snake off my porch and reach a water drainage ditch on one side of my yard.  There was zero leakage throughout the whole process, and the crystal clear water at the end showed that the flushing action was successful.I've seen quite a few variations on instructions for draining sediment, all of which were more complicated than Rogers version.  Although I can't guarantee his instructions will work for everyone, they worked great for my new water heater and took MUCH less time than I anticipated.

  Very sharp and worked well for the task I had. However, be careful getting it out of the package. The protective plastic over the blade flew off upon opening, and I stabbed my thumb. It bled quite a bit... all over my sink, my shirt, my countertops. It looked like a mini massacre had taken place in my bathroom. My husband walked in and thought I had finally given in to my threats about our demon cat that attacks the walls at random while growling and hissing...until Fluffy McLucifer walked in and began to lick the blood that had dripped on the floor.While I do not recommend using this tool to harm any animals because that's just plain wrong, I strongly suggest putting it aside in your underground bunker to use as a weapon in case of a zombie apocalypse or re-election of President Trump.

  The knifes gets 5 stars.  The caps get nothing.  I ordered 3 and they all fit with slop.  Turn the knifes down and the caps fall off.  It did on all 3.  Hey X-ACTO are you listening to your customers complaints abour your caps?  Bring back the old caps that stay on.Easy fix.  The part on the cap on the side that is slotted, with the dimple on the inside to grab the knurled blade cap.  This is molded too straight to the body of the cap putting no pressure on the knurled blade cap.  At the base of this tang where it meets the rest of the cap, heat with a lighter about 2 inches away for 7-10 seconds to warm the plastic.  Then push the tang in on the end about 20 degrees off plane.  Hold until plastic cools.  Your cap now will never fall off until you take it off.

  Even during the first use, the blade kept falling. I was just cutting a cake cardboard circle. At first, I thought may be it did not arrive properly assembled and so the blade was not properly secured.  After every adjustment possible, the blade kept on falling from the notch, while cutting. The blade does not even stay attached, for 10 seconds while in use. I had to hold the loose blade in my hand to finish cutting the thin cardboard.  NOT SAFE.  The ""safety"" cap is a joke. While you close it with the blade parallel with the cap, it is loose enough to fall down (When you hold the 'pen' upside down, the cap falls off as if it was simply placed on the top.).  So, you need to adjust it so the blade and the cap are at an angle. This way the cap becomes secure so it does not fall BUT the blade gets stuck in the cap unless you are lucky it comes out of the cap.  Zero star review is not an option, $5 lost.

  The Z-Series X-Acto knife is supposed to be the company's sharpest knife ever.If it is, I'm not experiencing it. I don't see in real-world use that it cuts any smoother or more accurately than the older knife and blade combo I've had for years. Worse, the knurled grip portion requires constant retightening, an annoying issue that costs this knife stars and one I've not had to this extent on any of my previous X-Acto knives.If I had to buy a knife again, I would not purchase this disappointment.

  I bought this X-Acto knife on the recommendation of some bloggers who do Scherenschnitte and silhouette cutting because, for Christmas, I did two silhouettes--one of my son, the other of my niece--for my mother. I am by no means an expert at fussy-cutting, but I know having the right tools makes beginning efforts and learning technique a heck of a lot easier. Based on their recommendations, I purchased this knife for a very reasonable price, and when I received it, I was pleased to see how sharp it was. It's long enough to feel weighty in the hand but comfortable enough for pencil-like grip to hold it. It was indeed very sharp, and cutting out eyelashes, lips, and bangs--and especially ""highlights"" in the hair--was much easier with this blad. I have used other blades just picked up in stores without much research, and I did indeed get a much better, more precise cut out of these.I'm still not an expert, but this novice came out with two silhouettes that clearly looked like the children I intended, so that's got to say something for this knife, right?

  I've been using X-Acto knives since the sixth grade when I discovered them. They have been immensely helpful in life and I have them at home, school, and work.I already had two X-Acto knives at home, but I'm drawn to shiny new objects, so when I saw this gold handled knife with sharper blades, I had to have it. It looks like the regular #1 knife, but with a gold-colored grip area to indicate that this is a sharper version with a ""Zirconium Nitride-coated blade."" The blade cuts through things effortlessly, but it's a new blade so I'll update over time on how long the sharpness lasts. Included is a blade cover which goes on tight (and gives a screeching sound when you put it on).As the sharper blades are the same size as the regular #1 blades, I may just upgrade all my blades to these. There is a #2 version of this knife with a bigger handle and bigger blade, but for some reason there are no sharper #2 refill blades.This is a great crafts knife that is incredibly handy to have. Recommended.

  When they said this knife was sharp, they really meant it! I randomly purchased this item as an add-on because it was fairly cheap, but didn't imagine I would use it on many projects. I've used this knife on many DIY projects, even as a box cutter to open up packages and letters. I definitely have used it a lot but the blade hasn't gotten anywhere dull. The only downside is that using this to cut stuff for an extended amount of time will give you a sore shoulder because of the repeated amount of force you have to give to the knife to cut stuff repeatedly so be wary of that!It has a convenient cap too for when you're not using it.

  I just received these so the review can't be all that useful or thorough.  Only time will tell with this kind of purchase.These units are about the size of a large fist.  Each is unobtrusive on the wall, being white.  Batteries are advertized as having a 10 year life and come with the unit.  There is an override button for the claxon - thank goodness!  One will wake up half a neighborhood.  VERY loud, VERY piercing.  But you want that.  My guess is it's louder than a car horn or drilling on a street and maybe even your smoke alarm.  There is a tamper proof button so that children can't accidentally turn it off..  It can also turn sideways - 90 degrees -  in the electric socket which is nice.  It has a small light on the front which should stay green for 10 years.It comes with a fair amount of paperwork.  Optimally, you would be able to fold away a cheat sheet and slip it onto or into the device.  But that is not possible.  The main points; how to turn it off, when to replace it, what do the beeps mean are scattered in the document.  But in the end, if an emergency happens, you won't need them and in a non-emergency you'll probably just rip it from the wall and remove the batteries and go look for where you filed the paperwork. :-)You are supposed to test it regularly - as much as you do your smoke alarm.  And vacuum it on occasion if you remember.  That's about it.  But it can save your life, so the expense is worth it.  Besides, the thing lasts for 10 years!  So the price is less than $2/year.  SO worth it!

  Have used these for over 20 years and since they only last 7-8 years (now 10) I continue to buy.  They do work as I had one near boat batteries I was recharging in basement and it went off.  Turns out charging lead-acid batteries gives off  Hydrogen gas which also sets off the alarm - learned something new.  I bought one of the more expensive with LCD display; waste of money.  I never looked at it and was really only interested in if it went off.  I have 4 in house.

  I got three of these alarms and they all seem to work really well. When you pull the tab for the backup battery, you should hear a loud beep to indicate it is working and that the batteries are properly detected. When plugged into the wall, it'll have a constant green light. When running on backup, it'll flash the green light every 60 seconds to indicate that it is still working and it'll flash red when the backup battery is low on power and needs replacing. As with any CO detector, you should install them at least somewhat low to the ground and away from space heaters to prevent false positives. And as always, refer to the included safety manual for more information on the product. One last thing to note though, it does come in a clam shell though, just use a box cutter and you can get around it, but still annoying. The product itself though is great and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep themselves and/or their family safe.

  Replaced three expired CO detectors in my home with these. They are LOUD, which is good for many reasons. They’re also unobtrusive, were very easy to install and have a 10-year service life as well as a battery backup in case we lose power. I chose the Kiddes over the comparable First Alert model because the Kiddes have a 10-year service life vs. First Alert’s 7-year service life.These units are simple and no-frills, which is what I wanted/needed. In my case I didn’t see a need to purchase fancy units with screens that give a read out of how many PPM of CO are in the ambient air - if there’s enough CO in the house to trigger an alarm, I’m leaving the house and calling the fire department instead of staying inside to check the readout.Would highly recommend these. They’re cheap insurance if nothing else and could potentially save the lives of you and your loved ones.

  I guess this is the kind of product you really don't know how well it works with but I haven't woken up dead yet so I guess it is working. I have seen what carbon monoxide can do to people. I have about two battery-powered ones and 210 V plug-ins in my house. I live in a single-story ranch house but I certainly don't want to take any chances. You have to change these things every 5 to 8 years for sure I don't care how long the battery lasts.

  At some point my dog decided that pooping in the house is the best revenge for me having a job which results in her  only going to the dog park once per day. She is way too smart for her own good and gets a little vindictive. Anyways, maybe once a month or so she will poop on the only carpet rug in the entire house.One awful day this happened while I was at work and before Sir Sucks-a-Lot (my robovac) did it's usually round of cleaning. As you can imagine this is definitely not a good mix. My usually reliable friend Sir Sucks-a-Lot went from sucking up dirt and pet hair to a one-day contract as a dog poop steamroller and paved the entire rug. IT. WAS. AWFUL. I smelled it as soon as I came into the house. The sight was way worth than the smell. My once green and white rug was now paved brown with the revenge of my best friend. I spent hours de-pooping and shampooing the rug. Once I was finished, I spread the odor eliminator over the carpet to soak up the remaining moisture (gross), and absorb the smell. 24 hours later Sir Sucks-a-Lot returned to his day job and vacuumed up the odor-absorbing powder and my left my run smelling great and looking good as new.I highly recommend for anyone with a pet who disrespects their rugs or carpet by pooping inside.

Now the fragrance is still present but a little more livable.  But I still have 2 and a half boxes that will now go into the trash.

  Does the job well but the ""fresh smell"" is a little overpowering for 12-24 hours after using it.Don't buy it here. Go to the store to buy this stuff it's $2 for 46oz box in stores.

  Holy hell. I feel it is my duty to leave a review as a warning and to mitigate the high ratings this is getting. I had very high hopes - baking soda and Oxi-clean - what a winning combination, right? Wrong. Or who knows? I can't tell you if this product worked because the perfume smell is absolutely overwhelming.I applied this very sparingly, waited 15 minutes as directed, and vacuumed. Then I vacuumed again. And again. And turned the air purifier on ""high"". Because the smell was overpowering me. I even opened windows in 40 degree weather to help with the smell. It didn't help. Sadly, the first room I tried this in was my bedroom, as my dog sleeps on a mat at the foot of my bed. So I had to sleep with this smell. Well, I didn't sleep. It was so strong it was waking me up all night. My dog even pawed at the bedroom door at 2AM like he needed to do his business, but I'm pretty sure he just wanted to escape the perfume smell (I believe another reviewer called it old lady perfume, which is pretty accurate).It has been 36 hours since application, and it still stinks. I'm wondering if I will sleep tonight. Or maybe I'll move to the couch. Honestly, something advertising as a combination of baking soda and Oxi-clean should be awesome and smell either close to odorless or else the lightest detection of ""fresh breeze"" or something. Great cleaning combination that they totally dropped the ball on scent-wise. Maybe they changed the original formula and the great reviews are for a previous version?Really, stay away from this. It is headache inducing. Let me know if you reformulate this to remove the perfume Arm & Hammer, and I'll happily try it again. For now, the rest is going in the trash.

  These are much smaller than I expected...about 2/3 the size that I buy in the stores.  The other problem is that the spout is one big opening.  Other times when I’ve used this product the opening is designed so that I can “sprinkle” on carpet- not this.  I do not recommend this product

  This smells wonderful, makes the entire house smell clean with a fresh scent that lasts for weeks.  It does a terrific job of masking carpet pet odors and I am glad I tried it.  I will be a repeat buyer.  At the time of my review this listing shows the front and back box panels but not the side panels.  I scanned those and will upload them along with my review.

  Our dogs like to lay on the living room rug and it was getting smelly. Heck, even the vacuum cleaner was getting smelly.  I would have bought a steam cleaner but we have no carpeting, only a couple of throw rugs. I was looking for something like the old Carpet Fresh and came across this product. The reviews were great and Arm&Hammer is a name I trust so I decided to give it a try. Not only did it make the rug smell great, it is visibly cleaner as well. Also, the vacuum cleaner smells nice. On top of that, right after I used it, my daughter came downstairs and said, ""Hey Dad, what did you do? The whole house smells nice!""

  If I could give this 10 stars I would!! We moved into a home where the old owners had dogs who pee'd in the bedroom. We were told the carpet was shampooed but it still stunk. We purchased this, sprinkled it on and let it sit. We vacuumed it up and no more pee smell. Prior to using this we shampooed the carpet but the smell was still there. Now our carpet smells fresh and clean a week later!! Great seller and amazing product!!

  Well, they did their jobs...I had a fire in our fireplace that was almost out, down to the coals, so I closed the damper and went to bed.  An hour later ""BEEEBEEEBEEEBEEEP.""  I looked at the alarm, and the CO LED was flashing.  Oops, I guess the coals weren't as dead as I thought.  It woke me up and the wife.I've also had it alert to smoke from me accidentally letting a damper close while there was a full-on fire and smoke began to fill the room.  Again...oops.I am glad to know they work, and, while I've been aware of the sources of my troubles so far, I am confident these will alert me if there is some real trouble happening.

  This Alarm is a “Photoelectric”  plus carbon monoxide which is a good thing. I would only use a Photolelectric or Dual sensor , “Photo  / ION” . This is regardless of the Carbon monoxide sensor capabilities. Do not rely on an “Ion” alarm to warn you of smoldering or smoke until it’s a breathing and moving fire. In other words , if you wait until it senses heat/fire, the smoke may have rendered you incapacitated, and it won’t help at that point. This detects “Smoke” and carbon monoxide, which is in my opinion the safer and gives you ample warning. check you tube or with the fire departments to make your own choice. Living in Florida we occasionally run a generator following Hurricanes and Tropical storms, so it’s a must to have the carbon monoxide feature.I tested both alarms myself with a smoke bucket, I was never able to trigger the ION alarm with smoke only in my test. Watch a few YouTube videos on the difference in alarm sensors.....1 year update,, no quality issues what so ever, and I own 4 of these. The only occasional announce is that  if my bathroom door is open following a steamy shower, this detector is near within a few feet of the bathroom door, and will trigger a brief alarm. This only happens if we forget to run the exhaust fan in the bathroom. To be honest I’m okay with this occasional annoyance reminds me how well it works. Over cooking has only caused a false alarm when we burnt a bag of popcorn in the microwave so it’s a good balance of sensitivity.

  Would give this product a 0 if I could. My husband and I ordered it in August with our baby due in September. Now, in October, with the detector only two months old and our baby girl only a month old, we thought something smelled just a little odd. We called our gas company after quickly leaving the house and when they got there they said we had a serious CO2 leak... that if it would’ve happened while we were asleep we may not have woken up... all of this and the DETECTOR DIDNT MAKE A SOUND. The gas company employee placed the device that he used to measure CO2 directly next to this detector and said it was measuring just as high there as it was in the rest of the house. Can you imagine how it would’ve impacted our newborn if we hadn’t got out of the house quickly???!!!! Do yourselves a favor, save your lives, and buy a different product!!!!!!

  A close friend of mines family here where I live in Connecticut, many years ago lost 3 children under the age of 10 in a devastating co tragedy.(you can look it up. Suffield,Ct. 1993) Carbon monoxide is nothing to screw around with.I am in the middle of some big renovations to my 100 year old home. I already have a smoke detector in every bedroom and co detector near my furnace. Building inspector came in the other day and “suggested” some additional ones. So I am adding one in the new finished basement, one on each of the two upper floors and replacing the older unit by the furnace. But I’m $5k over budget now and hardwiring in a 100 year old house is obscene. So I went with these.Please people, don’t mess around. These are pretty damn cheap insurance. Just do it. Now. You know you will be glad you did. I am. I’m actually grateful to the inspector, he got me off my butt.These are inexpensive but very reliable and dependable units. Will take you about 5 minutes to install. What my local fire department recommended. I want to sleep soundly and most importantly, wake up with my whole family.Thanks for reading

  The construction is good and solid, and does an excellent job of blocking sound. Note, this is not an ""active"" noise suppression system...this is effectively just a very well made passive earmuff hearing protection device with the ability to pair via bluetooth to hear music, podcasts, etc from a phone. While it does have a microphone, that mic is so you can have a conversation via your phone while wearing the earmuffs, not for someone wanting to talk to you standing next to you...you'll have to take them off to have an immediate local conversation.So, if used for listening to your phone's MP3's on an airplane for example, this is excellent...fidelity is quite good, and you can save a lot of money over other ""noise cancelling"" devices. Or, used when mowing the lawn, or other loud activities to preserve your hearing.If you use this while shooting, it will limit your situational awareness, just like regular earmuffs would do. You will not be able to hear people talk clearly around you, for example (again, just like regular 'muffs). And...you could listen to your music on the range, but that will reduce situational awareness even more.I bought this for listening to my phone while on a plane (It's REALLY good for that...you will be surprised at how loud you have to listen through ""regular"" headsets vs this one), and when using gas operated lawn equipment.Controls are simple and straightforward...one easy to find button on the side. A long press to turn it on or off. A double press for initial pairing. A double press to advance forward a track. Three presses to back up. Just one button. Volume control would be done on the device you are playing through, there are no volume controls on the Worktunes Connect 'muffs themselves.Charging is easy, and an LED indicator will show full charge. The device will also ""speak"" to you when it is powered on, powered off, paired, and can tell you the basic charge of the battery.There is an aux 1/8"" jack if you want to connect to a device via a cable vs bluetooth. The box comes with just the hearing protector, and a microUSB cable. No USB charger is included, you have to supply your own.

  UPDATE: I bought these in November 2017 it's now March 2019 and they are still working like a champ battery life is still very good (3 day's before I get notified through the earmuffs that the battery is low) sound quality is still perfect for music but not so much for phone calls you sound too distant and noisy to the person you are talking to but I can hear them pretty good but again I bought this headset to listen to music not for phone calls and for that reason I am very satisfied with this purchase and gave it the 5th star up from the initial 4 star rating.I highly recommend you buy this set and shop around for the 3M clips that snap into your hardhat and if they ever clunk out on me I'm buying it again without hesitation.I'm so glad I found this head set even though I had to remove the strap that goes over your head and placed it on the helmet clips from a different set then after I just tucked the wire away on the inside of the helmet where nobody could see it and BAM! super sneaky nobody can tell it's a Bluetooth headset especially if you work in a union factory who says listening to music is a safety risk get the hell out of here with that, now I can listen to music all day no problemo plus I have a earbud connected to my work radio/walkie so I can ear if I'm being called on the radio.  I tried connecting my work radio directly to the Bluetooth headset using the axillary port but it sounds muffled/distant also when I get a phone call I have to use my hand and cover up the axillary / charging port otherwise I get a ton of feedback from my surroundings (minus one star) but I'm not complaining because my goal was to be able to listen to music discreetly without the union babies finding out and make my 8-12 hour shifts more enjoyable.They hold a charge really good so far three days (two 12's and an 8) minus lunch and breaks plus I don't have the music at full volume so that helps too.

  For many years now I have used the blue colored heat transfer tape.  It has always worked well and given me no trouble.  I purchased the gold colored tape because I felt the bright contrast may be easier to see.  Well, yes, it's easier to see but the tape is so thin it is very difficult to remove once heated - and not heated for that matter.  I think I also prefer a wider tape. I obviously didn't check the width before purchasing.  I suppose I will throw it in my ""in case I run out"" drawer and go back to the blue heat tape.  Not the seller's fault, I just prefer a thicker tape as it's easier to remove after being heated.

  Wish I had discovered this stuff earlier!  I used today for the first time and it made making shirts with HTV and my heat press much easier. I was able to tape different colors for the same shirt together making the process quicker. Tape was easily removed and left absolutely no residue on my shirt. Also, some HTV transfer sheets (like for glitter) aren’t very sticky. I will be able to tape the sheet down to my shirt to ensure it doesn’t move during transport to the heat press.

  Love this tape! It is a must have if you make shirts, hats, or anything with htv or sublimation. (Or use a heat press for any reason) also if you do htv shirts or anything with htv and have diff layers to press you can use the same pieces of tape over and over. (I like to squeeze every penny out of a product lol) but I’ve never had an issue using the same pieces of tape I start with throughout layering all the colors on one shirt. will reorder when I need more!

  I have used this product for over a year and I did not have this problem n hand when heat pressing a child t-shirt. I immediately had to order this product. I prefer this width. It holds the vinyl without needing any larger size. I also use a small piece when I want a special distance below the neck, or on the sleeve, or other uses. This is an important product for me when I working with vinyl.

  Worked perfectly.  Stayed in place and was just like a Teflon sheet very heat resistant.  Works perfectly with my cricut mini press to keep things in place while pressing on small items like baseball caps.

  So far I have no complaints. I have been using this with HTV with my heat press on fabrics to stabilize designs before pressing. I can use the pieces of tape multiple times before they lose stickiness which is a plus. I haven't seen any residue or anything on my garment after using the tape. There's not a ton to say about the tape other than it is doing it's job effortlessly and successfully. Highly recommended

  I use this tape for holding together bundles of automotive wires, versus using electrical tape that leaves behind a residue; I also use it to protect the wires when applying heat-shrink.  While the tape is a little on the thin side, it doesn't rip apart easily and holds together well -- maybe a bit more adhesion, but that's just personal preference.

  If you are looking to REMOVE CAULK, get whats called a ""Painter's Tool"", far superior to this tool.  If you are looking for a tool to FINISH CAULK (improve the edges), get a ""DAP CAP"".  Although this kit contains lots of sizes for finishing caulk, grout, etc., it's cheaply made, inadequate for removing tough caulk, and did not do as good a job ""finishing"" as the DAP CAP.

  I bought this 3 in 1 Silicone Caulking Tools and really if you have issues with having caulk on your finger then just wear a pair of latex gloves. I just use my bare finger and then wipe it off. It's so much easier to wipe the caulk off my fingers than to wipe off it off from the tool. If you want to have that ease of peeling like in the video then you still need to tape the section your caulking so there's not time save there. Even though it's only 8-9 dollars, I find this to be a complete waste of money. The only good part of the tool is the caulk remover but it's still a uncomfortable to use because of the moving silicone caulk piece and the scraper. The edges of the scraper will some time poke your hand. In my opinion is better to just buy a paint scraper, it'll have more uses than this.I tried using this tool and what would have taken me 5-10 minutes using my finger took me an hour to clean all the mess from the tool and silicone tips. It also took a long time to remove the excess caulk that was pushed along the tile. With all the excess caulk, I still got a ton on my fingers. It just isn't worth it.Also, I don't often log on to give bad reviews. This may be my first 1-star review, and it gets this because the tool may actually make the work more difficult and time consuming.

  I had to re-do some caulking around 2 bathrooms as well as some external door frames.  I bought this little tool to make the process go more smoothly and I am so glad that I did!The scraper quickly and easily removed the old caulking from all the surfaces and worked so much better than tools I have used before.  It was so much easier to scrape out the old stuff.I then used the opposite end with the rubber spatula attachments to smooth out the applied new caulking.  It made a clean and smooth line on tile, marble, and wood services.  This baby makes my work look much more professional than what I have done before.It’s also super cheap!

  It seems like every time I caulked in the past, it never quite got smooth. The multi point tool is tremendous and allows you to easily smooth the joint. It works like a squeegee in getting off extra caulking from unintended places. I didn't even need to tape...it came out much better than when previously taped, since the tape left a line/joint. This was perfectly smooth. It was so easy I did 3 places in the house already!I don't know what the blue pieces are for as there are no instructions.Great kit and reasonably priced!

  This caulking toolbaet works on Silicon tape caulking strip.Even though I didn't intend to use it on silicon strip but in regular caulk I changed my mind after receing it.When I did use the silicon strip, it worked like a charm.

  Overall I like this caulk tool set. My only real complaint is that there is a piece that slides over another (so you can change tools) but there should be a locking mechanism to hold it in place. Too often it would slide up when I wasn’t trying to use that part. However, I really like the metal blade. The tool I had before (that this replaced) was plastic and broke easily. This removal tool made everything SO much easier.

  I just have to write a review on this!  We just bought a house and the previous owner and his adult son were quite lazy when it came to cleaning up spills.  The very light carpet was stained from dumped drinks so I immediately had the carpet professionally cleaned and I actually watched him using stain removing products which did not work.  I ordered this Folex spot remover based on the high reviews.  With fingers crossed, I used it on the carpet stain.  I actually put on a latex glove and I worked it down into the carpet because the carpet is a short, tight plush pile so it didn’t seem like it was getting down in there.  I did this for about 5 minutes and then I covered with an old towel and stepped on it.  I then just walked away leaving the towel in place.  I came back about 10-15 minutes later, lifted the towel, and OMG, it was GONE.  Completely gone!!  This gentleman had also left a dining room set and all of the chairs were stained, one being particularly bad with what appeared to be spilled coffee or cola into the seat and then just left there.  I have no doubt this stain had been there for many years and I had absolutely NO hope whatsoever that it would come out but decided to give it a try anyway after what it had done to the carpet stain.  I did the same thing, sprayed very heavily onto the seat and allowed it to soak in for about 15 minutes before covering with a towel and just leaving it.  I actually had forgotten about it and left the towel on over night.  The next morning I remembered and lifted the towel and I just couldn’t believe my eyes.  It too was completely gone.  I just had to post pics of this because it was truly unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product enough.

  A few years ago I lied to myself when purchasing my Subaru Forester and thought I could keep my nice, light platinum interior clean. For those who are unaware, Subaru has a very light grey interior color offering that's called ""platinum"". When new, it is beautiful- light, happy, clean looking. If Joanna Gaines designed the interior of a vehicle, I think it would feature this color.At some point, somehow, even though we have no children, a stain appeared on my back seat despite my best efforts to completely cover any and all upholstery I could. I tried oxi clean, I tried vinegar and baking soda, both to no avail. I had resigned myself to needing to pay for a full detail of my car, until I saw a car detailing video on youtube in which they used this product. So I thought hey, why not! $16 for this vs hundreds for a detail? I'll try it. And surprise! It worked great!!Tips for using this product:-Spray more than you think you need. Dont be bashful, spray a good amount.-agitate more than you think you need. In the video I watched, the guy used a detailing brush to work this in (instead of fingers like the instructions state). I just used a cheap soft bristled paint brush from walmart.**you want to spray enough of this on where when you agitate with the paint brush, there is a slight foam.-when you think you have agitated enough, go at it some more-blot when doneSome of the reviews here say it works better if you leave your towel on it for a bit- the spot on the seat I was trying to clean was vertical so I could not test this theory but it's worth a shot.The first time I tried using this, I didnt use enough product or agitate enough. When I was done I blotted and walked away for a bit and I swear the stain looked worse when I got back, I assume because the product was lifting the dirt. I sprayed again (using more than last time), and agitated again (more than last time) and when I was done the stain had vanished!Ultimately a great buy, worth the money to give it a shot on your own interior!!

  I have rental property and a renter just moved out. The carpet looks as if they missed their mouth more times than they made it with their coca cola. So, I decided I need something that was a little stronger than regular over the counter stuff. I found this product, Folex. It sounded good and wasn't terribly expensive. I decided to try it. Well, it doesn't work worth a lick. Yeah, the spot disappears alright, while you are spraying it, then as soon as it drys, its right back again. Just so everyone knows, the photo taken above was after I sprayed those spots twice and literally emptied an entire bottle on them. I have a real funny video we did in our first use of this product.

2,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Folex Instant Carpet Spot Remover (32oz, Pack of 2), Clear, 64 Fl Oz",NA,5.0,"
  Before I begin, let me say that we primarily purchased this product for use on stains generated by a new puppy.  Folex was recommended to us by a professional carpet guy.  For very recently ""made"" pet stains this stuff is awesome!  It very thoroughly removes the staining substance, dries quickly, does not alter the color of the carpet/fabric and best of all, has no smell itself.  For me it was bad enough having my home's carpet violated by our new mongrel, but the thought of my home smelling like said violation + some cleaning product was very unappealing.  Enter Folex, it works great on pet stains, cleans the area (which I have double checked with my OCD-approved UV-blacklight) and leaves no odor of anything behind.  It is the best I have found.As for set in stains, it works well but it is not a miracle product- that said I am not sure anything is.  Due to the fact that this worked so well on pet stains, I got ambitious and tried it on all the nagging stains I had in my beige carpeted upstairs bedrooms.  One was a rust stain I made several years ago when I absent-mindedly placed a rusty bolt directly on the carpet while installing a ceiling fan; that stain came out 5 out of 10.  The other was from when I stepped on a rogue eyeliner shaving from my bathroom floor that imbedded in my sock and got on my master bedroom carpet as I left the bathroom.  That stain was about a year old and it came out 8 out of 10.Overall, Folex is terrific for new stains and pretty good for set in stains.  The price here, especially for the two pack, was way better than the store as well.  Hope this helps and good luck.

  Bought two of these to hang brooms and mops, this item was listed as an ""Amazon's Choice"" so it seemed like a safe bet. I have single holders but wanted something to hang multiple items together and this seemed like the solution. With this hanger, it is nearly impossible to get the handles into the holders. You have to hold the piece in with one hand and then shove the handle into the holder. The location of the holes for screws also makes it difficult to sink screws into the wall at the correct angle. Not worth the money or the hassle. Not sure how this product possibly has over 5k great reviews when it doesn't function properly in the one way it is to be used.

  What should have been a 5 minutes install became a 30-minute, rage-inducing carnival of mayhem.To start off, the first two screws stripped despite having drilled pilot holes into a stud and using a soft torque. Then the anchors would not fit in a 1/4"" hole and the next size up was too big, so the screws spun the anchors in the wall. Yet were someone still anchored enough to NOT release from the wall. Thus leaving me with a strip-screwed, mal-anchored piece of garage hanging in my garage. Now there are six large holes in my wall, the Home- It Mop and Broom Holder is in three pieces in my trash can, and I am writing this review.All this despite having installed dozens of things far more complicated that this little POS such as closet units, laminate floors and most recently, ceiling mounted storage racks.Stay away, unless you too, wish to have every flavor of nightmare.TLDR: hardware is substandard and worse than unusable.

  This product doesn't work for what I needed and wanted. The image makes this unit look like a nice grey color with a simple, modern look. In person, the color is a dirty beige grey and it looks like a piece of junk plastic from the 80's. But, it goes in a utility closet... so if it functions well then I can overlook that it's so ugly. However, there are many design changes I would suggest:- The 5 different broom/mop holders need to be spaced further apart (the current spacing means everything is too crowded looking and hard to access each tool and I'm only using 4 of the broom/mop holders and zero of the hooks).- The unit isn't far enough from the wall to accommodate many types of modern brooms/mops that feature wider handles. For example, I have hardwood floors and use the Bona Mop and it keeps falling off this organizer because the width of the Bona handle and the angle of the mop head requires the Bona to be pushed into this organizer at a diagonal this unit isn't designed to hold items at an angle.- I had hoped to hang my Dyson Cyclone v10 vacuum from this unit and this unit cannot accommodate the thickness of the Dyson vacuum.- I would prefer a product that comes in a few standard color options (I would want white) and the option to hold wider (diameter) products (like the Dyson) and I would make this product stand an extra half inch from the wall to accommodate handles on some mops (like the Bona Mop).- I would prefer the option of being able to purchase this product as a strip of mop/broom holders (like this current model) or purchase individual holders, so I can by 1 or 10 if needed and then I can determine the necessary distance between each product being organized on the wall.

  The wall mounted holder works well, nothing slides down (so far) and the storage seems secure.  My only suggestion to make this a 5-star product would be to have a small tab to push up the spring mounted arms that hold your items in place.  I don't have an issue loading or unloading a handle, but my Wife does.  She complains that the springs are too strong (but they need to be).  She can get things out of the organizer but leaves me to put them back :) .  Rather than use the supplied hardware I used wallboard anchors that are a bit more substantial.  With six of these holding up the Mop and Broom holder, it's not going anywhere.  We purchased two organizers: one to mount one behind the door to the laundry/mud room for mops, booms, a hardwood floor sweeper and a yard stick.  The second will go in my garage to store a broom, scrub brush, paint roller handles and a push-broom.  It's difficult to see it on the product photos on Amazon but there are also six flip down hooks, they aren't heavy duty but rather a nice place to hang light-weight items.  If you are looking for a way to get similar items off your floors and out of corners, this has item has met my expectations and then some.

  I really wanted to love this!  Installation was easy with simple power tools.  Screws and plastic wall anchors were included.  We mounted this in our utility closet, and after putting my duster handle in for the first time, the rubber ""wheel"" that holds in handles broke off and the spring fell in the floor!  I am really disappointed in this product that it broke the first time I used it.  Too bad we've already drilled holes in the wall or I would try a different brand.  I've also had it for several months before we got around to installing it, or I would return it.  We still have room for 4 handles, but I wonder how long they will last.  I wouldn't recommend this product.

  I have a small apartment and the broom closet was always a mess with the brooms hitting me in the face whenever I took the trash out. This saved me so much stress! The slots have little rollers and they move to fit just about any size mop or broom. There are also little hooks that can drop down if you want to hold towels or the dust pan, which is what I use it for. This is a must-have organizational tool!

  I wish I'd purchased this sooner.  It works great and was easy to install.  I held it up against the wall, placed a small level on top to ensure it was straight, used a pencil to mark the center of each screw hole, installed anchors, and screwed in.  It gives me warm fuzzy feelings when I see it because everything looks so organized!Note: I had an issue with my broom sliding down through the grips.  Weight-wise, it was the lightest thing I tried to hang; there were no issues with the heavier items.  Wrapping a rubber band around the handle solved the problem (see photo of yellow broomstick handle).

  This is an honest review of this item, which I purchased full price on Amazon.com:So far, I'm impressed with the build quality, but not so much with the power...I often times think people get to focused on the advertised ""MPH"" on the box..don't be fooled!For my application (Blowing dust and some grass clippings off of my driveway) this blower is perfect. Its light weight, built well and its very affordable. If you find yourself cleaning up a larger area or heavy debris, I would recommend  buying a different model. I would classify this as a light use model.This is my second Black+Decker blower I have owned. I inherited a 25 year old one from my dad that just went out. If I can get that much use out of this one Id be happy.

  Have used it a couple of times and it worked just fine for me. I'm a 5'1"", 71 yr. old ggmother with carpel tunnel, arthritis an a slightly torn rotator cuff. It is lightweight, comparative to others and powerful enough for the leaves I've been gathering. A big guy would likely want something more powerful/heavy duty. But this one is short enough I don't have to lift up to use. Can use at normal arm level.

  You never really know how much easier a job can be until you make a change. I really wanted something lighter and smaller, and this fit the bill perfectly. This blows stronger than my gas powered blower. It's light, and very easy to handle. I would use this for any job where I would use a corded blower. When I have to blow in a larger than a 100' area, I use my gas blower. The tone it generates is not a high tone, which can be hard on the ears. This is not quiet, I would say, but its the tone that makes all of the difference. It's a lower tone, definitely not shrill. For the money, you can't go wrong.

  I started out wanting a  Green Works cordless blower because I already had a Green Works mower and could interchange the batteries, but could not find one powerful enough at a reasonable price. I finally gave up and selected This Black and Decker. I have many other Black and Decker appliances and like them all except for their requirement for a cord. The LB700 model is light, but still powerful enough to blast stuck-on leaves from the driveway and is relatively quiet. It works for me.

2,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"ZeroWater 5-Stage Replacement Filter, 2-Pack, White",NA,5.0,"
  If you are reading about this Zero Water Replacement Filters, you probably have the Zero Water Pitcher or the Dispenser.  If you filter drains slowly, it can be fixed.  The problem is that the filter probably has a big air bubble inside and prevents the water to drain through.Just tap the filter and sometimes the bubble would break into smaller bubbles and release through the two holes. If that does not do it, try using a small blunt object and wiggle the membrane underneath.  Be careful not to puncture the membrane.  This should release most of the air trapped at the top of the filter.  Once the air is released, the filter would drain properly.To prolong the use of the filters, I use two dispensers.  I filter the water twice.  I use the filter that is at or above 6 as the first filter.  Since my tap water is more than 200, my first filter would drop this down by a large number even though it would be above 6.  My second filter thus is filtering water that is way below the tap water reading.  When the second filter read above 6, I used it as my first filter and replace the first filter with a new one.  The new filter always filters the water on the 2nd time.  It is a little work but I prolong the life of the filter.Yes, I love the Zero Water, the water tastes good enough for someone like me that does not like to drink plain water.Update.New stock for Zerowater filter has blue seal and is fused to the filter.  The old stock is just a black 0-ring.  Both seems to filter the same.  The Blue seal one comes with a cap. I found out why, read on.The first two Filters from my recent 12 pack order seems to be fine but when I opened the third one, there was water dripping out of a new filter.  There was even condensation on the cap.  I sent an email to Zerowater and inquired about this condition.Following is what came back from Customer Service: -Thank you for contacting ZeroWater. Before the carbon is added to the filters it is washed. The cap has been added to retain that moisture to prolong filter life. The filter is safe for use.Thank you,JoshCustomer Service SupervisorZeroWaterSo, this is the reason that the newer stock filters are coming with caps.  The caps are keeping the moisture in the filters.

  Something is going on with the filters I purchased on Amazon, Initially for the first year I purchased Zero Water filter directly from their website and they last about 20 to 30 days in my household. After they stop shipping to Hawaii (about 9 month ago) I bought my filters on Amazon and notice that the life of ALL the filters (I purchased a 12 Pack) was only 10 days!!!). I do not know what is going on , but after reading some reviews on the website it is obvious something is not OK with the filters and they need to either come clean on advertising this filters as recycled and/or make better filters. I will look for other brands because it has become excessively pricy having to change my filter 3 times a month.

  Ok, I love my zero water filter system, what I don’t love is being swindled. I bought the 2 pack of filters as back up for when I would need to replace my filter. Tonight was that night. As I opened the first sealed bag and opened the blue top there was water and the filter was wet! I asked my husband if he thought that was normal he said open the other sealed filter, so we opened that one up as well and guess what?! it was dry!!  So out of dumbfounding curiosity we tested both filters and of course....  the one with water had been used! The reading came back as 002 and the dry filter came back as 000. This is not ok! And since I ordered this back in June, I don’t really can’t take any actions except for  writing this review. I really hope this was a one time screw up and not something that is happening with others.

  These filters only last about a week, week and a half! If you are lucky you can get two weeks out of them. You will be constantly spending money and reordering these, repeatedly throwing out giant plastic filters as well as the packaging they come in multiple times a month if you purchase the Zero Water Dispenser System. I have to admit that during the first week to week and a half that you have installed them, they will be great! They will work fine and the water will taste great and you will get a 000 reading on your meter. Then, seemingly overnight, your water will taste awful (worse than from the tap, as if there is mildew or something off) and when you measure it with the meter you will get a very high reading.What's upsetting is that the company is aware of this but you won't find out until after you purchase and use it. When I replaced the first filter, I saw that the packaging addressed the issue. I didn't see it on the filter that came with the dispenser unit. It said that if you are replacing your filters often then there is an issue with your water and to call a number to ask about a discounted filters ""program"". A friend who bought the same unit and filters as I did, based on my premature and naive recommendation, called the company and was told that, yes, the filters wear our very quickly for people who live in areas with certain water conditions. They didn't offer help past that. Great. My friend has already set up a delivery water service and I will be doing the same. It is much cheaper per month than replacing these filters and will save on wasted materials in the long run.I recommend NOT purchasing these and looking into other options. We are in a rental home and cannot install a permanent filtration system but there are home water delivery options!

  I bought these for use with my Keurig K-40 Coffee Maker. They work great, and are a great value. Highly recommended.After cleaning my Keurig recently and inserting a new water filter, I was chagrined to discover that the coffee maker wasn't working properly -- it didn't seem to be priming properly and would whir and whir endlessly, with no output.After a bit of troubleshooting, I realized that air was trapped in the water filter assembly, and was apparently causing the pump not to prime properly. So here's a tip: Follow the directions for preparing a new water filter (soak at least five minutes in tap water and rinse to remove any loose charcoal particles). Then when inserting into the water reservoir, gently ""tilt"" the filter assembly to near-horizontal. This will allow any air trapped in the filter assembly to escape (evidenced by bubbles). Finally, re-affix the filter to the intake on the bottom of the water reservoir and you should be good to go.

  At first I was hesitant to buy these filters after reading some reviews about the water being gray. But I decided to bite the bullet and just try them. The directions say to soak the filter in water for 15 minutes. I gave it a few minutes longer, at 20 minutes just because. And that was the only time the water was a little gray, but that was obviously because the charcoal filter was just soaking in the bowl. But after testing it, the water going through the Keurig was totally fine.I think for those who had gray water it was probably because they either didn’t soak it long enough, or maybe they need to clean out their Keurig too every once in a while. I know everyone’s experience differs, but I just wanted to share my positive experience with those who may be hesitant like I was!Plus, a 12-pack for a great deal. These will last me 2 years before I have to order another pack (change out every 2 months obvs). Awesome!

  I purchased these filter as it was time to replace mine. The instructions are written on the outside of the package and are very easy to follow. The instructions say to soak he filter for 30 minutes but I soaked the filter for about an hour. I place the filter in a bowl of water and did some other things around the house and just was side tracked. Lol.  When I came back to changing the filter, I took it out and rinsed it for 30 seconds like the instructions said and put the filter into my Keurig 2.0 coffer maker. At no time was there any black stuff in the bowl or when I rinsed the filter. I even squeezed the filter a little to be sure and no black stuff came out. It fit the filter holder perfectly and the coffee I made immediately after changing the filter tasted just fine.I also looked at my old filter which came with the coffee maker and the one I was putting in side by side.

I bought this air purifier because I have asthma and our older purifier just wasn't working for me anymore. I have had asthma flair ups being in the basement because, like any basement, it can get damp and has poor circulation. We run a dehumidifier and 3 tower fans during the summer and it helps.I did not notice any significant differences between the original filter and the animal filter.

The mixture of these things actually does cause a bit of a drainage problem and after about a few days of use water began to collect at the bottom of my tub. My husband actually took it out while he showered at one point so he didn't have to stand in it. So I suggest changing it out every few days and not a week.Cleaning is also a bit difficult. Because most people shower at least once a day the TubShroom is always wet. In the ads they clean it while the hair is completely dry so it just slides right off. Well the hair product and in my case my husbands alternating shower schedule with mine keeps it wet making it a bit harder to ""Remove the hair with one effortless move.""After cleaning it I rinsed mine off with hot water and a little bit of Dawn dish soap to get off the hair product and all the other grimey stuff off. I've since put it back and have found a good schedule as far as cleaning it goes and haven't had any drainage problems since.It's a good product and I do recommend it but I do suggest considering the things that I've mentioned.

  I have to say I was a bit skeptical about this product when I first heard of it. After several recommendations from friends (and needing to find another solution for the hair clogs) I went ahead and purchased it.We are a household of 3 woman, 2 with short hair and 1 with long hair, not to mention several family member visits a month with multiple people having longer hair. Oh, and a medium haired dog that does get washed in the shower.I tried 3 other drain catchers while i was waiting for this one to arrive. None could hold up and frankly were nasty to clean out.I removed the metal catcher with a screwdriver and placed the Shroom in its place (as directed by the printed instructions on the box), at first it looked funny sticking out a bit (the instructions tell you this is normal) and my mom thought I had dropped a giant button in the shower (top view). The first shower was a grand success. Not only was the water able to properly drain (goodbye standing in a pool of your own dirty bathwater!!!!) but the hair dropped into the catcher without it collecting on the top (so it was not visible to one taking a shower). Once I was done, I didn't think it had worked since all the hair drained, little did i know it was draining into the spool. All the hair that had gone down was indeed caught and very, very simple to remove from the spool. I grabbed tissue and just ""peeled"" the hair off and threw away the trash. Voila! I don't know why I had ever hesitated. I like it so much and it is so useful, i am including it in all my housewarming gifts. It is the item you never knew you needed nor wanted. But now that i have it I am so much better for it.

  Update #2: 2.5 years later and I’ve only had to unclog the drain once, and I believe it was just because of soap scum.Update: more than a year later and I have yet to have to unclog the drain!I am one of those people who clogs the shower drains with my hair. It got to the point where I brushed my hair well before getting in and then kept a brush in the shower to wrap the excess hair in while shampooing, and would STILL clog the drain every 6 weeks or so. I've had this about 2 months now and thought I'd really test it out by no longer brushing my hair before or during the shower. No clogs! It's amazing how much this thing catches considering it's this cheap looking piece of rubber that doesn't even fit well. I will say, it's much easier (and a lot less slimy) to clean when dry. And the loose fit (& lightweight) means sometimes my cat thinks he can play with it again and I'll find it in the bedroom floor. I tell everyone I know about this thing.

  AMAZING! A must have for families with long shedding hair!!Doesn't fit snug in my tub drain but fits well enough. Once a month I used to have to use chemicals to declog our shower drain as the amount of hair coming from my long hair and my teenage daughters made it so the shower would clog up and provide us with three to four inches of standing water. It was a real pain in the butt, a constant added expense, and made the tub constantly feel and look dirty. I bought this hoping it would catch the hair as advertised causing the drain to not clog. This tiny little device is a true miracle!!! We've been using it for almost 3 months now and I have yet to need to use chemicals 2 declogged pipes as we have ZERO clogs!! I do have to remove the plug everyday to remove the hair that has collected otherwise the tub will not drain. Cleaning the plug is a nasty job as you can imagine hair soap scum Etc. The only true negative that I have found is that the in side of the plug is hard to clean as the soap scum collects to it and using a tissue simply won't clean it. About once a week I have to go in with a pipe cleaner or bottle brush to clean and sanitize the inside of the plug cylinder.***update*** its been about 6 months or so and I just purchased a new poo be. The original got too nasty. These are really hard to clean and clog up with soap scum, body fluids etc quickly. After a while its time to toss and replace. Still even with replacing 2 times a year its a bargain compared to using chemicals 4 + times a year! Product works great and I still give it 5 stars.I just wish it was easier to clean!

  I had some outlet protectors already, not sure what brand. But my 10 month old daughter figured those ones out. These ones are nice because they are discreet. They sit flush with the outlet. They aren’t distracting so my daughter doesn’t find interest in them. And they are too thin for her to pry them off. I actually kinda had trouble getting them out of one of my outlets but I find that a good thing, they are definitely child proof. Can’t beat the low price either. And they arrived very quickly.

  These are flimsy and aren’t sufficient to protect a child.  They don’t stay in the socket and could easily be pulled out.  Also, they are MADE IN CHINA by Jasco, with the notation that GE is a trademark under license to Jasco.

  We have a grandbaby that like to get into things and knows about wall plugs as we have nightlights plugged in and she see them if we forget to remove them prior to her arrival.  To have open receptacles is really asking for trouble, so like everyone else, i looked on line and at Amazon for covers.There are many to choose from and it can be a bit of a pain to go through reviews, figuring which is real, which are not, etc...I know the name GE, plus knowing they do electric light bulbs, sockets, etc..., who better to know how to prevent electrical accidents.  I bought these and am very happy with them.I wanted something simple, something that I can push in fairly easy and not too hard or easy to remove.  If it is too easy to remove, they could fall out or my grandkid could easily remove it.  Too hard to pull out and you'd have work your nails in behind it and hope you don't break a nail.  These are pretty easy to push in, fit snugly so they don't fall out and yet can be removed with just a bit of effort.  In other words, they work perfectly for us and the grandkid has yet to be able to pull them out.  She is 2 and these outlet covers do the job very well.As far as quality...hey, they are small pieces of pliable plastic but yet, not flimsy.  I'd recommend these to anyone who needs basic receptacle covers.

  Some fit right and are difficult to remove and other are very loose and can pull right out (it's not the outlet as trying different covers resulted in different fits). Ultimately, our toddler learned he could pull out some and loved playing with them. Now he is obsessed with trying to get them, the fact they draw him to the outlet really makes these more dangerous than safe!If they were consistent in size, these would be a 5 star product - but they don't. Luckily, they give you enough you can go through them to find the ones that do fit the best.Quick tip: insert them carefully as they are designed to have an up and down :)

  So, imagine for me if you will that you are a middle-aged parent with a couple of twins army-crawling around the house. Now this isn't my first time to the rodeo either; I have a few babies that I have managed to keep alive, but never more than one at a time... Whoever invented twins, well they shouldn't have. Now that I'm thinking about it, keep your eyes out, I may be starting a 'parents of twins support group'. These twins of mine may just be giving twins a bad name. They don't just dislike each other, they downright hate each other. And now that they are beginning to move/scoot around the house, paired with the hate, they prefer to go in their own directions, which makes it impossible for one grownup to keep track of them both simultaneously. And for whatever reason, baby humans come out of the womb with this uncontrollable urge to commit the most dangerous acts. One of these dangerous acts that they can't help but commit, is the urge to stick random things into other random things. And just as convenient as electricity and outlets are, they are just as equally dangerous. These are priced very fairly when you take into consideration the potential costs if a baby human were to stick a fork in their nose, and then into the outlet...

   This is quite awsome product. Of course it's cheap but not only cheap. I has function! So easy to set. Kids can't remove it. My oldest one is 6. And she will need time to remove it if she want to. So if younger kids? They can not remove for sure. And it seems nothing on there so kids can not give pay attention for that. Enought to use. I left two of them. If I need it more in the future I will buy again.

  These work perfectly for me. I am using them just as dust and water cover for my surge protector that is near a sink.In my picture you can see one didn't fit so I cut it down.  This isn't a problem because all surge protectors and outlets are spaced differently.  You can't blame the compony if some don't fit.  The good thing though is that the aren't to small.  This means you can always cut one down to fit your outlet.  Also they were very easy to cut with normal scissors.They  fit snuggly and are easy to put in and remove which is great for me but might not be good for keeping kids out.

  I got these protectors to childproof my new place. I do not think my new place has particularly large holes -  but these plugs would not stick and  is super easy to peel off.  It can stay on - so if you are only looking to make it look like the outlets are covered, sure...but it defeats my purpose of actually preventing my toddler from sticking her fingers into the holes.. hence returning!

  I will start off with the only negative, and that is the adjustment angle of the fan. You can only adjust it sideways, not up or down. Not a major issue for me, but for some with low or high windows, it may be an issue.On the low fan and the coolest setting, the 5,000 BTU unit will freeze a 150-200 sq. ft. bedroom.  The lowest fan setting is not too loud for sleeping, but I personally need white noise or the sound of a fan to sleep. It may bother people who need a quiet sleeping environment.The cost is very competitive in the market. I am comparing this to a similar Frigidaire unit. I am much more pleased with the Media. The competing unit did not keeps its Freon charge, and was much louder and less energy efficient.The Media A/C arrived earlier than expected, even during the delayed shipping times during the pandemic.It did not come with a remote control, but that is not an issue for me. The extension cord is ~5 feet, so it should reach most 3-prong outlets.Very simple assembly, no directions needed for the handy person. You WILL need a Phillips head screwdriver. Be careful not to over tighten the window brace when installing it, otherwise you will strip the threads in the A/C unit.

  The upper dial is sorta placebo. The actual cooling only has 2 settings, on and off. There's no actual levels, the cooling only kicks in when the dial is turned all the way up.So you basically have a choice between room temp air, or ICE cold. I mean this things cools like it's looking for it's super suit, and that's the only reason I didn't give a lower score. 250 sq ft limit? Yeah it'll turn your 250 sq ft into a walk in fridge if you leave it on all night.It's also LOUD. I mean if you're planning on reading a night before Christmas while this little beast is on you better have some BOSE (tm) noise cancelling headphone because this will make your eardrums wish they were not eardrums. Plus side is I can no longer hear the traffic outside my window when this thing is on.Overall 3 stars5 stars for cooling ability1 star for noise1 star for ease of control3 stars for installation (pretty standard, leaves some gaps in the windows)2 stars for air directionability (only adjust left and right, tho you can use blinds to deflect the air up and down)2 stars for filter (doesnt take regular air filters, had it's own washable meshy filter that imo isnt very filtery at all)4 stars for overall construction

  Sooooo mines didn’t bring a remote \: BUT THATS FINE! This ac was everything I ever needed. My room is in the front of my house, so sun is hitting it from 1-8pm, it was a sauna!! Even at night the heat lingered in the air and my room was the ONLY room in my house to be that hot. I was kinda doubtful that it would significantly cool down my room, but I was okay with that, I just needed it to be a bearable temperature. It was a easy set up, and pretty light for an ac. I brought it up the steps myself and I’m a 5’2 twig, can’t even do a push up. So it was light, the installation was really simple. And my room is so COLD I HAD TO TURN DOWN THE SETTINGS!!! I recommend this 100%

  Small, (reportedly) efficient and inexpensive, no frills unit. The reason I am writing this review is how quiet it is. We bought this early in the season before things got hot and before they would become harder to get, so didn’t really have the chance to test it.So I installed it yesterday, and while it’s not really heavy duty, the price tag wasn’t either and so long as we get a few years out of it, that’ll be reasonable to me. For instance the unit isn’t perfectly aligned on all the front cover and one of the metal feet is slightly skewed, but hey it’s not that big of a deal, this is a budget unit.Having waited so long I started wondering if there turned out to be anything  wrong if I’d have an issue returning it. So I finally turn it on, I hear the fan running quietly and am waiting for the relay to kick in and the compressor to flip on and raise the noise level.When this didn’t happen I started to worry. I turned it off and thinking maybe I had missed the “click” and compressor kick on, I started it again. Same. I was like “huh”? But the thing is, the air was nicely cold and knowing it was high 80’s outside I knew it had to be doing the job. Yup. It’s THAT quiet. Pretty nice honestly. Not just for ourselves but also so our neighbors don’t have to hear “brewawarreesaaawrrrrr bzzzzzzzhhhhh rawrrre” every time the unit kicks on and we all also don’t have to endure sustained loud compressor noise afterwards.This aspect alone makes this line worthwhile if they are all this way. Maybe the bigger units are louder, I don’t know. But what I do know is this is a small, economic, simple (which usually means less to break and more reliable) and effective unit for a small room.

  First of all, I got this product to cool down a room that is about 20ft by 20 ft. For that, it's wonderful. I don't even need to turn it up to full blast during a Florida summer. It is pretty loud, but for me, that's not a problem. The real problem is that there was no weeper hole.This thing was amassing tons of water, which would hit the fan, and there was no where for the water to go. I had to drill three small holes in order for the water to drain. I shouldn't have to do that.I will stipulate that it came with instructions that I did not read, but I doubt if those instructions claimed the user had to drill holes in the thing.Overall, I like it, and I would be willing to buy again.

  Strong, just like it was advertised. However, the spacing between slots is much too small. As you can see in my photo, I was able to fit 3 items reasonably well.

  This thing is AWESOME. I wanted one and put it on my wish list where it sat for... months? It just wasn't high on my priority list. Finally, after a few months of battling the brooms in my cupboard one day I pulled up my wish list and there it was, waiting for me. Having had it installed for a few weeks now I can tell you- I should have bought it MONTHS AGO. I've been kicking myself for not getting it sooner.It takes about a minute to get used to, because it takes a smidgeon of force to get your brooms/mops/etc in and out of the individual grips but I acclimated to it quickly, I'm glad the grips are strong- it keeps everything exactly in place. Nothing falls or slips out. Rather than having brooms, mops, dusters falling at me every time I open my pantry now they are neatly waiting for me when I need them, not when I don't. REALLY happy with this purchase. Saves space, reduces frustration and was a great value.

  I bought two of these based on the great reviews.  What I should have done is read the critical ones because they're all telling the same story - this thing is difficult to use and pinches your fingers.  Don't get me wrong, if you had committed a crime and were trying to conceal your identity by removing your fingerprints permanently from your body, this thing would work great.  You see, the little ""rollers"" that hold the items in place don't really roll.  And the springs are so dang strong that you have to push them out of the way with your fingers to put anything in or remove from the rack.  So what does this mean?  It means that the ""rollers"" (which don't actually roll remember) snap back and pinch your fingers between the grippy rubber and the razor sharp edge of the rack body.  Great.  Just great.  Then the best part!  There is so much force required to do this action that it literally rips the hanger from the wall because the wall anchors they send are junk!  This leaves 6 large holes in your drywall, blood on the floor, and a screaming wife.  Thanks guys.  You've really been helpful here.

  Pros: Comes with a great template to make installation easy. Comes with self drilling anchors for installation on drywall. Allows the organizer to be securely mounted and handle a lot of weight safely. The overall quality is very good. The springs used to grab the handles is just the right tension to hold securely, yet not so stiff you can get the handle in. The added hooks are very handy and snap up and out of the way if you don't need them. Very clever!Cons: The heads of the screws that mount through the organizer into the hangers are very small. The mounting holes are very deep in the organizer making mounting virtually blind and requiring a long screwdriver. These things made mounting more of a pain than it had to be. I purchased 2. 1 had just enough screws and anchors the other was 2 short..Wish list: I wish it had at least 2 more handle grabs. I wish the screw heads were larger

  First off, the instructions to mount this are terrible. A vague video that doesn't even tell you whet size drill bit to use. Second, the anchor and screws they provide are terrible quality. The anchors stripped and warped as I was screwing them into the wall. One of the screws had a rogue piece of metal which prevented access to my Phillips screwdriver and the screws that I was able to get into the anchors weren't the right size as they continued to spin once screwed in. The spaces between the slots are too small so you can only really hang three things on there and they aren't strong enough to stop sweepers from sliding down to the floor. Absolute waste of money and time. Do not buy.

  Repeat customer!  I purchased 1 to organize the garden tools (rake, hoe, cultivator, shovel, etc.) in our garage and by alternating the tops of the tools up/down, was able to fit them neatly in the holder.  Liked it so much, going to install another next to it for the other items.  The hooks are a nice feature to hold our gloves and a simple plastic bag to hold things when needed.The installation kit was very helpful and was able to install without using a drill.  I know all installs are unique, but was lucky in the spot I selected in the garage, which was a wooden shelving unit.

  After getting the ultimatum from the wife to organize the garage, I had to jump on this organizer.  I was looking for something that wasn't going to cost me $70 plus to get things set in the garage. This tool organizer seems to be set to do the job.  I wouldn't hesitate to grab more of these if needed.  The one thing I was wishing was different was just a little more room between the different slots.Pro tip - alternate your handles up and down....this allows you to not have crazy overlap and space issues due to multiple rake and shovel heads hitting each other.

  I use heat guns quite often, mostly for applying heat-shrink tubing, and bending PVC tubing and pipe. For these applications, I have a couple professional heat guns by Milwaukee, with accurate digitally controlled fan speed and heat control that can be variably set and then the gun adjusts to maintain the setting. But those cost a few hundred dollars, and I wanted a couple inexpensive basic heat guns for my home shop and garage.I decided upon two different models by Seekone, the less expensive one that is the subject of this review, and a somewhat more expensive (yet still inexpensive) model that adds a digital temperature readout and solid-state setting of fan speed and temperature.So, about this very inexpensive basic model. It is a classic utilitarian device with a solid, decent quality appearance and feel. It seems like something that will hold up well to light use, but I don't know if I would either trust it for any kind of production level work, or to last for many years of regular use.The housing is all plastic, with practically the only metal visible being the hot air nozzle, which by the way is approximately 1-1/2"" diameter. The housing from the rear/base to the end of the nozzle is about 9-3/4"", the diameter of the body is about 2-3/4"", and the handle (including the power cord strain relief) extends about 7"" below the body of the gun. The heavy duty power cord is about 56"" long, and its strain relief included a loop which I presume is to allow hanging the gun on a hook (although not to be actually used that way). The gun is rated to be 1800W, and it could hardly be any more than that since that gets you to about 15A, the maximum on most 120VAC single phase power outlets. The gun is specified for 110VAC rather than 120VAC, although that should not be of great importance, and only 60Hz is mentioned, which should only influence fan speed, so I don't know if the gun's fan could be damaged, or work poorly, at 50Hz.The gun can be held, well, gun-like in one hand and aimed at the object to be warmed/heated, and the case & handle design make this mode fairly comfortable, with a good balance and other ergonomics. But the plastic is all hard, with none of the soft-finish we have become accustomed to with many power tools, so this probably makes extended use without wearing gloves somewhat uncomfortable.The other mode is to balance the gun on its rear-end/base, with the nozzle pointing up, so you can use both hands to hold the object to be heated in the air stream above the nozzle. This is a test for many heat guns in my experience, because many have a tendency to tip over, and because this can easily start a fire, they need to be closely watched when used this way. This also can show where the money was saved to get the low cost.....my Milwaukee models use something like a silicon rubber jacketed power cord with high strand count conductors inside, so the power cord is soft and floppy, with minimal stiffness, so the weight and/or stiffness of the power cord, coupled with the greater weight of the gun, make it more stable in this mode. By comparison, this Seekone gun is very light weight, and the power cord, while electrically adequate, is also inexpensively made, and is quite stiff. I found that I had to adjust the position and orientation of the gun until I found a stable place to let it balance while in use, and another other position or rotational orientation on a floor or table would result in the power cord's stiffness pulling on the low mass of the gun, so it would just fall over immediately.My Milwaukee guns have the ends of their handles at the same level as the rear base of the gun's housing when used in vertical mode, and this also helps stabilize the gun. On this Seekone gun, the handle itself cannot be used this way, but they DID include a wire bail that snaps into two holes near the end of the handle. Normally, the bail rests against the back of the handle, but you can flip it to another position where is acts to extend the handle such that it touches the same surface that the gun is balanced on, making it more stable in that direction; this does help to offset the stiffness of the power cord, at least in one direction. However, on MY gun, the wire bail was installed with its bent 'foot' on the wrong side, so the power cord would not allow it to be flipped into that ""kickstand' position....I needed to spring the bail out of its holes, and turn it around 180 degrees, and then re-install it onto the handle.The gun comes with four accessories, all of which modify the airflow out of the nozzle:- Concentration nozzle, 2"" long, reduces the normal 1-1/2"" diameter nozzle down to 7/8"" diameter- Concentration nozzle, 2"" long, reduces the normal 1-1/2"" diameter nozzle down to 1/2"" diameter- Reflector nozzle, 2"" long, redirects the air from the nozzle to one side (the shovel shaped sheet metal piece is about 1-1/2"" wide). The reflector as furnished is fairly flat, but you could potentially bend it to redirect the air differently, or even curl it around something like a dowel to make a looped shape (many other heat guns come with just such a nozzle, best for evenly heating heat shrink tubing around electrical wiring)- Deflector nozzle, 3-1/2"" long and 2-1/4"" wide, flattens the hot air stream and directs it to one side; this is probably for stripping paintThe gun has two controls:- Three position 'fan' switch, OFF, LOW, HIGH- Large temperature setting knob that actually forms the rear base of the gun (the gun rests on the knob when in vertical mode)The fan switch is pretty obvious, although it is not apparent from looking, or reading the brief users manual, if this also influences the heating element (as many other heat guns do, limiting the gun to only one heater element if the fan speed is low, and allowing both heating elements (or more) to be powered only when the fan is at a higher speed.....more on this later.The temperature knob seems to be marked backwards (and I see some other reviews saying the same thing). It seems to be showing a counterclockwise rotation for higher temperature, but that is not the case. Turning the knob clockwise increases the temperature.I did a series of tests, supporting the tip of a food grade thermometer 2"" above the end of the nozzle while the gun was in its vertical mode. I tried the gun at both LOW and HIGH fan settings, in each case with the temperature control knob fully counter-clockwise, centered, and fully clockwise:LOW Fan- CCW = 132°F- Centered = 290°F- CW = 400°FHIGH Fan- CCW = 116°F- Centered = 290°F= CW = 550°F (see below in ****)In all measurements above, I allowed the gun to run undisturbed for one minute before reading the thermometer, and then I averaged the readings over another minute to get the temperature number. In all cases, the temperature actually took at least 30 seconds to more or less stabilize, and once stabilized, the temperature cycled up and down around the average temperature, about 5°F above and below the average, i.e a 10°F fluctuation. When the temperature had settled to its low extreme, I could hear a sudden slight drop in fan speed, then the temperature would rapidly climb to the high extreme, after which the fan speed would increase slightly and the temperature would slowly drop back to the  low extreme, and the cycle would repeat. This is indicative of a thermostat-controlled heating element, in spite of the sales lingo that suggests something more elaborate, and in one place ""rheostat control"". My guess is that the temperature knob simply adjusts a thermostat set-point, and that switches the heating element on and off, nothing fancier than that.What does surprise me a little is that in the HIGH fan mode, the lowest settable temperature was lower than what I measured in the LOW fan setting, although the highest temperature was certainly higher in the HIGH fan mode. My guess is that with the heating element at its lowest power, or the thermostat's lowest sensitivity, the heater is putting out the same BTUs with the temperature knob fully counter-clockwise, but the air is blown past it faster to it does not pick up the heat quite as much. ********* I noticed that at no time did I measure anything above an average of 550°F, .......FAR from the advertised 1200°F maximum. Then I remembered that my food grade thermometer can only read up to a maximum of 600°F, although with that I would assume that I would have read UP TO 600°F instead of just 550°F. I also thought that I observed the usual thermostatic cycling around that 550°F set-point; if the nozzle temperature was actually getting up above 1000°F, then I would not have expected to see cycling around 550°F. Of course, nothing in those specifications says WHERE the temperature might be taken to get that 1200°F, so perhaps if the temperature probe were jammed down inside the nozzle close to the heating elements, you might see it that hot. But in my view, if a heat gun is being used on its highest settings closer than 2"" from the work object, that could be a safety issue, so I went with the 2"" that would be typical, at least for things like heat shrink tubing.BTW, most heat shrink tubing is polyolefin, and the normal recommended shrink temperature for that is about 200°F, so the LOW fan setting and the temperature knob turned to about center of its rotation will be plenty warm for that task.Please look for my separate review of the digitally controlled version of this heat gun.

  I was concerned about the handling and weight of this gun before I received it....but it is easy for me, and I do have arthiritis so I'm grateful for that.  Definitely gets plenty hot - I use it for my acrylic pours, and resin work on my artwork.  Good buy, and value for me.

   Nice heat gun. I bought it to do some restoration work on my car bumpers. It worked well and I had it on none stop for almost 2 hours and there was no issues. Haven’t used the other attachments so I can’t say for those.

  Already spent a few hours scraping thick layers of paint off the house...requires the highest heat, but works fine. Seems sturdy and came with LOTS of attachments and scrapers (more than mentioned in the listing). Big improvement over my old one (which lasted 20 years, but had a tendency to ignite wood splinters). Better heat control; also a little wire stand to rest on as it cools. I noticed that the sound of the fan/motor changes after using it for a while; probably a good idea to cool for a few minutes when that happens?

  I do a lot of electronic work, especially on PCB boards. I often have to remove through-hole components and sometimes desoldering them with my Hakko soldering iron and a solder pump just doesn't work and the part is very hard to remove. I decided to forego paying a lot for a cheap specialized hot air reflow station and instead try a high temperature heat gun. It made a huge difference. This heat gun is able to get hot enough to melt the solder, leaving me to remove the component with tweezers while the solder is still liquid. What a time saver! I wish I had bought one sooner.My only gripe with this unit is that it's hard to tell precisely how hot the air is, there is no temperature reading or even a general idea given on the turn dial. Solder melts around 370 Fahrenheit, and I had the gun turned up about 3/4 of the way. I could have been a bit under or over temperature though, TBH.

  Works extremely well, I'm very, very happy with it. The temperature adjustment dial I could swear is labelled backwards however- unless I'm totally misinterpreting it, hot and cold on the dial are switched. I actually thought it was broken at first because the temperature was so low, until I turned the knob the other way and it got as hot as expected.Still, fantastic purchase.

  Heat gun works great. I will say the temp control is easy to use but can easily be misunderstood at a glance. There's a triangle on the gun just above the temperature control. This might make you think the triangle is an arrow pointing at the control knob to tell you what temp you've selected. That would be false. When turned all the way up, the triangle is pointing at the lowest temp. When turned all the way down, the triangle is pointing at the highest temp. Took me a second to realize that.

  Working on a project that required I wrap a 24"" x 48"" x 1/8"" acrylic sheet end to end, I initially chose a smaller heat tool, but I struggled and struggled to get a large area hot enough to make a uniform bend without lumps.Then I purchased the SEEKONE Heat Gun 1800W and got it wrapped within an hour! Not only is this gun configurable and well designed, but the customer support people are crazy fast and efficient.  I had an issue with an attachment and within 2 days of emailing their support, I had a replacement at my doorstep.I cannot imagine a more versatile quality heat gun at a lower cost.

  I don't get why the package dimensions are so important when nowhere does it lists what size drain openings this will fit. It does not fit all drains, especially those with a disposal. I've tried this in 4 drains and it's a loose fit in all of them. This does not lock into the drain opening. It basically sits on top and relies on the weight of the water to create a seal. If you try to open the strainer the whole stopper pops up.Good idea, but lacks in design for all sinks. There are better options that actually work and it's not this one.

  Update 4/282020:  Item returned for refund and received by amazon on 4/24/2020;  still no refund provided.I bought an OXO Good Grips 2-in-1 Sink Strainer Stopper to replace the cheap steal strainer in my sink.  Seems those cheap ones all break in a matter of months.  I put it into use as soon as it arrived (about 20 minutes ago). So, I figured a strainer/stopper that cost 500% more would be, at least, 100% better.  I hate when I'm wrong!Made of silicone, this product has a steal ring running near the edge with about 1/16"" of silicone extending beyond the steel ring.  However, it does not completely cover a standard 3 1/2"" kitchen sink drain, so it does not seal around the joint which let's water drain under the edges when the stopper is put into service.  Instead of sealing the ID of the drain as do the cheap ones, there is no way it can prevent water from draining out of the sink.Additionally, the edge of the strainer sticks up above the level of the sink about 1/16"".  This prevents almost all garbage from draining into the strainer which means all the garbage must be hand-pushed into the strainer or picked out of the sink by hand.This is a lose-lose situation for the purchaser

  I've had the strainer-only version of this for years and, while not perfect, it has done its job well, so I immediately jumped on the 2-in-1 strainer/stopper version when my classic style stainless steel stopper broke.Unfortunately, this model has quite a few flaws:1. As a strainer, it does a poor job of filtering out smaller particles while also getting easily clogged up with an amount of stuff that any other strainer could handle without a problem. The sink I put it in actually clogged recently, despite never clogging with the old strainer, making me wonder if the strainer just isn't working well.2. The rubber parts get really slimy, so it needs frequently cleaning (this was one of my complaints about the strainer-only model).3. It's overly difficult to clean as the bottom piece that allows it to work as a stopper has just a small hole to access the inner portion. This wouldn't as much of an issue if it wasn't for the above issues with small bits getting through and the rubber getting slimy. You can pull the strainer side out to get some space to shove a sponge in to work around the inside, but it's awkward and tedious to get it completely clean and spending an inordinate amount of time cleaning a strainer/stopper just isn't something I want to do.4. The stopper is really easy to accidentally engage as it just takes a slight bump to the handle to rotate it.5. The lip is raised excessively, causing a small amount of water to puddle around the edges unless you remember to lift it up each time to let the water pass.

  My sink drain has been stained since I bought my house. I've scrubbed with a ridiculous amount of various cleaners, but still been unable to make it look better. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my well water. Also, I only had one strainer stopper that also looked nasty and would rarely decide to stop water from draining out. This little gem has made my day! It hides my nasty drains and it stops water from draining out. I'm so excited! It's the small things...literally.The first pic is a before picture showing just how nasty my drain looks. The 2nd picture is my drain with the new gadget in it. I bought 2 so I could have them on both sides of my sink. Hopefully they last and don't tarnish from my well water. I haven't had them long enough to know if they're easy to clean, but I think they're dishwasher safe, so that's a big plus.Don't overthink it.....get this! You won't be disappointed!

   The suction power is great and was able to stop the water. It filters well too. There are two problems, however.First is it’s hard to clean. You have to dissemble it as shown in the video. And because I cook a lot of meat, sometimes it gets oily and this thing gets GROSS if you don’t clean it often. The oil builds up. Last night when I open it, there were so much gunk in there that I even wanted to throw it away. You see in the video that it still looks bad. I actually cleaned it with my hands last night...Second, the water flow when you open it fully is not really fast... but I guess that’s something most of those water stopper share. I just wish it was quicker though, so that I would want to use it more often...Overall, as water stopper, it functions beautifully and the turning on-and-off type of set up is quiet brilliant. Just some drawbacks

  Normally I wait for at least several months experience with an item before reviewing it, but the outstanding customer service from Century deserves an immediate acknowledgement.I now how have 4 of these timers, 3 are functional. The original order was for 2 which is how they are packaged. Straight out of the box one failed to advance the time. The pass-through switch worked but the timer did not. Rather than return them I first sent the seller an email describing the issue. Less than 5 minutes later they responded with an apology and a promise that a replacement item would be sent the next day with a tracking number - which it was. It arrived from CA to the east coast 3 days later. (My email was sent at 9 PM by the way.)The replacements work fine.Two followup emails came from Century. One the day of shipment noting that both new timers had been tested and the second  3 days after receipt asking if things were satisfactory. This level of seller responsiveness is unusual and should be acknowledged.Specs: 3 prong,  non- polarized & grounded. Size: 3 1/4 in long, 2 1/4 in wide, 1 1/4 in deep. Dial 1 5/8 in diam, Weight 3 1/3 oz. Electrical tolerance: 15A @ 125V, 1875 watts - tested. (Tungsten is less - 8 amps - not tested) Minimum time setting 30 min. A pass-through switch is located on the side to manually turn on the device plugged into the timer. Settings are: black dial is night, white dial is daytime. (The product title does not mention , that it's a ""mini-timer"" but the fine print in features does as does the product carton.)The plug is at the bottom of the timer and does not obstruct the lower outlet if inserted into the top one. Timer is operated by pressing down buttons around dial for the desired ON period. If buttons are up the circuit through the timer is turned off. [Note - timer is shipped with all buttons down.] A lip edge on each button must be pulled up and some force is required. It's best to rotate the dial as the buttons are pulled up so that the buttons to be pulled are at the sides of the timer to gain maximum leverage but it can be done with a fingernail.It's the smallest timer I have ever had which is good from a space viewpoint but the numbers on the dial are therefore extremely small and for people with less than excellent vision are difficult to read. My experience so far with the working timers has been good. An update will make note of problems, if any.

  Broke after ~2 weeks of use. Taking it apart revealed that there is a tiny plastic pin that broke (see images). That pin is responsible for holding the assembly which presses down on the switch to activate the power plug when the dial moves to the right time/position. That pin undergoes a lot of stress when the switch on the side is pushed into the ""Always On"" position, so I'm guessing it was because I overused the on/off switch on the side to turn the lights on. If the second one lasts longer I'll update this review.

  The quality of these is terrible.  I tried both and they make an annoying noise that I could hear across the room of the dial turning.  Some of the pieces you press to set the time would not move, even when pressing very hard. The switch on the side is extremely flimsy.  The units got warm after a few min of use with one low power LED light plugged in.  Most of the good reviews of this must be fake. This is one of the cheapest feeling products I’ve ever had.

  Only had them for about a week, but good to go so far.  They are quite a bit smaller than other three-prong mechanical timers, and the way you set on and off times with the pull up/push down tabs all the way around the dial is also different, but they work fine.  I bought them to use on my aquarium for CO2 injection using a solenoid, and light management, but tested them on a desk lamp for a couple of days first, just to make sure they worked and kept accurate time.  They do seem to keep time over a couple of days, although as with any type of 24 hour timer, you will have to check it periodically to ensure that it has not lost or gained time.  These are an inexpensive solution that works, if you need a three-prong timer! Only reason for the minus one star is the short period I have had them in use...usually don't give 5 until the product has proven itself over time.

  I always take a power strip for our cruises since there is typically only 1 outlet in the cabin.  Power strips have these horribly rigid cords that can make placing your strip where you want it a bit challenging.  The cord on this item allows much more flexibility.  The plug outlets are spaced apart enough to allow for bulkier charging devices to be plugged in next to each other.

It’s very light, which isn’t bad but there’s not much of a grip at the bottom, so it will easily slip off of wherever you have it. I’d recommend securing it with double sided tape. A small feature I was bummed out about was the length of the cord. It’s great for a really short distance but for me personally, a little longer cord would’ve been great. Another great plus (if you’re Like me and can hear these things) it does not make any noise, like that annoying electric current noise. Which is awesome.

  So much yes! I was just on a cruise and the main thing I needed this for was my fan. I CANNOT sleep without a fan. I was told that there are very little outlets in our room and I should purchase this. It’s perfect! There are several USB ports to charge phones AND the cord is semi long, so I was able to plug my fan in and reach it all the way to my face!

  I love everything about this surge protector... it has a high-quality flexible cord long enough for me (I use it for charging my iPhone, iPad, LED lamp, LED clock on my dresser drawer).It comes w/ 3 outlets, 3 USB, and 1 USB C.  It does have a little green led light showing the USB charging is on.The design is spot on. It also comes with an attached velcro for cable management.The best thing the added beside the USB C is the off angle 3 prong plug so it doesn't get in the other outlet's way...nice.Buy this one unless you want more USB C outlets...

  I love it! I'm using this power strip on my nightstand to charge my phone and other peripherals.

This purchase counts as a good decision. Definitely recommended!

  I originally purchased separately the plastic 23 inch cleaner to unclog the shower drain. However that was not long enough and although something came out it only caused the drain to clog up completely. Desperate to fix the problem (since the water did not go down), I ordered this hoping the 40 inch would do the trick. It arrived the very same day (prime shipping). At first I struggled with it but after a couple of tries, figured out how to use it. You need to twist (turn) the coil by the handle once it’s inside the pipe. What it removed was horrifying and satisfying both at the same time. Finally the water runs down the drain like a dream! I bought the oxo drain protector as well to further protect the drain. I am so relieved! And totally recommend this product.

   We bought this for our bathtub, which was clogged and half of water  since several days ago, it flow very very slow. The drain gets stucked of long hairs I guess.  My wife always likes combing her long, thick hair in the bathroom. It is perhap one of the reasons why the drain does not work well.It was horrible, it became smelly,  I should never let it happen again to us.These are really great tools. I am so excited about this product. Today, finally, after using the tools I just received, the drain is unclogged now.I only followed the tips from people who had tried them already and used only one tool from this kit. You know what, the little tool is amazing. It is quite easy to use all around. You just need to do like what I did in the video uploaded. After several times, the drain works for us again. It totally solved our problem. It helped me get out a lot of hair mixed stuff from the drain.Strongly recommended to buy this drain kit and the price is good too.

  I have had clogs before. Oh boy, have I! I have even had to deal with clogs at work because sometimes people flush things they know darn tootin' well they have no earthly business flushing. You know who you are! Anyway, my toilet decided to go on strike right smack dab in the middle of a major pandemic. Plumbers were like --'Nope, we ain't touchin' that thing. . .but if we do we're gonna charge ya, Scroogie! We're gonna bankrupt you and make a mess while we're there!' Okay, they didn't say that but that's what I imagined they would say to me if they had been open. They were shutdown -- just like everything else around here -- except my job and the hospital. So I decided to take matters into my own hands -- quite literally, chaps.So I dialed up the old internet and found this thing on Amazon and decided to give it the ole college try. Since I do have some experience with clogs I had an idea of the issue at hand. And as embarrassing as this is to admit -- entirely my fault. Because of the pandemic people decided they needed to poop more and because of that they bought up all the toilet paper. I decided some paper towels would work to handle issues I would rather not discuss. Boy, what a mistake. And it could have been a very costly mistake.But thanks to this device that was not the case! You folks should have seen me, I went after that clog with a vengeance. It was no match really. I pwned it so badly I should have been video recording it and yelling ""World Star!"". So I won this battle and now my toilet flushes with such ease that it's literally like music to my ears. . .and my wallet.I don't know how well the results will be for other people since clogs come in all shapes and sizes and some are deeper than others but this product worked very well for me. Also included were some plastic little things for sink clogs that I bet will work great on hair in the drain. Unfortunately for me, I am going bald so I will unlikely ever get the joy of testing those out. But I have them just in case! So that's my review.

  This neat little pack comes with a bunch of different tools that can get into different types of drains. When one didn’t really work in my sink drain I just tried another until I found the right one. The green and orange plastic ones are pretty sturdy. I struggled with getting it out of my tub drain, it got caught a lot, but the spikes down the side never broke and they grabbed on to a lot of hair and clumps on its way out. Also, one thing I didn’t think I saw in the description was a small flower with a chain and plastic nubs. I have left it in my bathtub drain and since it’s caught a lot of loose hair and it super easy to clean. In other reviews I saw that others received this flower so I don’t think it was a miss ship. My only little con is that it came in a plain plastic bag with no instructions on which snake might be best for which situation. I mean it’s not too hard to figure out after a little playing around with them, but would have been nice to have a little more of an idea of what all I got.

   My girlfriend has a lot of hair so it's easy for the drain to become clogged. We've tried different plungers different drain clearing liquids and different tools and none have worked as good as this.

It is actually neutralizing the cat pee smell.  I can't believe it.

  We have a cat who has been struggling with acid reflux and the bedroom carpet is his go-to place for early-am vomiting. (He has been treated and is doing a lot better now.) I normally treat the stains by hand with paper towels and spray cleaner, but I began to fear that despite my best efforts the carpet was probably more horck at this point than it was berber.I ordered the Hoover Paws & Claws carpet cleaner based on pawsitive reviews and the fact that our upright carpet cleaner is a Hoover. I was really pleased with the results! Using the upright cleaner with care, going over tougher stains multiple times and being sure to rinse and dry thoroughly, this cleaning solution did better than any other Hoover liquid shampoo I've used in the past.It also has a very light, fresh scent that was a huge relief to me. I get migraines and am sensitive to smells, so I was really happy that this one smells nice and didn't bother me at all.I would definitely recommend this.

  I was very disappointed in this product. The bottle arrived bent and empty, as in there was zero cleaning solution in the bottle and in cannot be used. The package was wet (and it hadn't been raining) so it may have gotten damaged and leaked all over the package.

   *TIPS*-For those of you that are having trouble with colors after calibrating, and are willing/still have the ability to physically move the camera, try this:After calibration slightly move the camera around the calibrated vicinity until the colors mimic what's on the TV screen. That is the spot, and angle, you need to have your camera. In my application, mine is placed below my TV on the center channel. My colors weren't correct and it was due to my camera having moved when I bumped the stand.  Once I realized this, I moved the camera and used the changing of the colors on the LEDs matching up to the colors on the screen to figure out where to replace the camera. Took 15 seconds.-Don't be afraid to move the camera and recalibrate again/more then once if you are not attaining the proper results.-Not quite getting the colors you want? Try adjusting the saturation bar in the app all the way down if need be. This kept my whites from becoming too blue and my yellows from becoming too green.-For those not wanting to stick the orange calibration cubes on their screen, try performing a web search for Govee Calibration Test Screen. That video may or may not serve as an alternative. I misplaced my cubes and ended up using it with no issues and similar results.-Check out their product website for constant sales. Wish I would have checked there first.*12/30/20 UPDATE ADDED AT BOTTOM**ORIGINAL REVIEW*This is not my first set of Govee brand light strips as I also currently own  2 sets of their H6163 model in use under my couch and media center. Having had such a great experience with those, I decided to try out one of their TV light strips. I had been actively searching for a lighting setup that reacted to what was on the screen for quite a few years. Those in a similar boat have heard names such as Ambilight, Dream Screen, amongst others. The problem was that they always seemed to have too many bugs, limitations, or required more work outside a simple plug and play effort. Seeing how far tech has come along, I'm glad I waited as these seem to be superior in quite a few ways.Installation:This was installed on a wall mounted 85"" Sony. Govee lists this strip as fitting up to an 75"" screen. This is a bit of a play on words as yes it is true it can fit, but it is obviously designed to fit something closer to a 55 or 65"" screen. The idea is to have the strip stuck to the back of the TV as close to the edge of the border as possible. I am nowhere near the border on the 85"" but I knew the limitations surrounding the screen size before ordering and thus my expectations were already in check. I laid the lights out to test they all worked as well as measured the length. Govee lists them as being roughly 12.5 feet. I measured about 14 feet including the wires that curve around the corners of the TV. I wanted the power line to fall on the right side when facing the back of the TV so I ran the strip clockwise starting from the bottom right. I ended up installing them roughly 7-8 inches from the edge of the sides and about 4 to 5"" away on the top and bottom as I felt this was the best use of the length provided in relation to the screen size I have. Your experience may vary depending on your layout.I plugged everything into the control box and rather than stick it to the TV using the installed double sided tape, I was able to simply wedge it in between my mount and TV. I'm glad I did that as initially I had installed the camera on the top of the TV but wasn't a fan of the ""UFO antenna"" look. Plus once I calibrated it using the app it seemed the screen didn't fit within the camera. During calibration the app asks if you chose to install the camera on top of the TV or the bottom. I ended up moving the control box lower on the back of the TV and taping the camera to my center channel which is just a few inches below the TV. Recalibrating in this new location provided me enough distance from the TV for the camera to catch the entire screen while also having the added bonus of placing the camera in a more discreet location. Having calibrated the camera to the screen a few times differently to see if the way I calibrated made a difference, I realized camera location and calibration is key to making this work correctly.Experience:This light strip does all the cool party tricks the H6163 model does but now with an additional ""video"" mode! This is the reason you buy this kit. It is in this mode that the lights react to what is on the screen via what is captured in the camera. I personally have not had the issues some have mentioned they had with previous model(s). The colors of the lights have done a great job reacting to what is on the screen and can get quite bright. There is some latency in changing colors especially in the movie configuration of video mode although transitions are smoother. Latency seems reduced in the game configuration of video mode with a more rapid color transition. You can also decide if you want the lighting to be distributed sectionally based on what is captured on the screen, or if you prefer to have the whole border react to showing just one color at a time...similar to the old Philips TVs from some years back. I went back and forth while watching some HDR and Dolby Vision movies and both modes work great depending on how you feel that day. I can see where the game mode would be preferred by gamers due to the lower latency of the lighting transitions. There is also a ""saturation"" scroll bar which allows you to fine tune how deep the colors show. I adjusted the distance of the TV from the wall to see how the lights responded to being farther from the wall. I currently settled at being about 9"" from the wall but I am still playing with the distance. My fear was the lights would be set so far away from the edge of the TV that brightness would suffer but that isn't the case. I have nothing negative to say about how bright these get as they get bright enough for my application.The Immersion lights have an updated version of an existing ability on my H6163 light strips which is the ability to access all app features without having to turn on bluetooth since it works over your wifi network. I wish the H6163 model worked this way as it is somewhat of a bummer when you are flowing with everything and then have to stop to turn the bluetooth on to access DIY mode. The Immersion lights ""Scenes"" mode also has 4 additional themes with the ability to adjust the brightness. The H6163 model does not allow you to change the brightness of the Scenes mode. Hopefully a future update will allow this ability on my H6163 to match the Immersion lights.Integration:My H6163 already syncs with my Google Home so adding the Immersion lights was as easy as opening the app, finding the Immersion light model, and adding it. I have set up some custom scene profiles to be able to control all of the lights grouped in various ways.  You'll need to go into your google home app and add the lights to a room to take full advantage of controlling the lights via ""OK/Hey Google..."". The Govee app also allows the ability to set the lights to turn on/off by setting a timer but I prefer walking into the room and commanding google to handle that responsibility. It is quite impressive to walk into the room with company and telling google to ""turn on the media room lights"" as they watch the lights turn on in their last configured setup they were last turned off in. Your hard work is rewarded with high praise followed by questions on how to attain a similar setup in their home. This is furthered when they watch a movie or play a game as their viewing experience is heightened from the lights behind the TV reacting to what is on the screen.Customer Service:I reached out to Govee before purchasing to see if offering a true 85"" version of the immersion style lights was on their road map. I had a response in my email the next day stating they currently have no plans to do such. I haven't had to have any warranty work performed but the fact that I am getting any response at all, let alone the next day, is promising especially when customer service and follow-up seems to be lacking in so many of today's companies.Final Thoughts:Govee seems to constantly keep their app updated with new ways on how it reacts with their light strips. They also seem in tune with their fan base/critics and what is being requested in future applications and updates. My biggest gripe is that I feel Govee needs to expand their lineup for this strip to truly match the size of the TV especially as larger TVs become more popular amongst buyers. This has been echoed many times in many reviews of their other products. Given the price point of this in comparison to the Philips Hue, which I was also considering, this is an amazing product! I would happily pay more to have a true 85"" kit if they ever came out with it and would gladly be a tester if they offered it. In the meantime, I am very satisfied with the current offering.*12/30/20 UPDATE*It looks like they have changed the size parameters in their description to fitting 55-65"". Though this set of lights is a truer fit for those size TVs, I've had these on my 85"" for a few weeks and I'm not disappointed. Here's why:-Adhesive and build quality-I've removed the lights from the TV a few times to reposition them better for my application. I did no additional wiping down of the surface and was even a little aggressive with the removal. I would have figured by now that the adhesive would have started to fail me but this is not the case. The lights still adhere exactly where I placed them and all lights still work with no issues. I definitely recommend measuring the area where you plan to install these in hopes of a more ""one and done"" setup, but it's good to know you can reapply if it's not to your liking the first time around.-Brightness-Even though the light strip does not reach the edges of the TV as it would in the sizes it is recommended for, sliding the brightness bar up to 100% yielded lights bright enough that I don't necessarily feel like I'm missing out on the experience. I typically have the brightness closer to 50% which creates a more cohesive feel in my setup. I've still got the TV pulled about 8 to 9 inches from the wall and I get plenty of color expanding quite far out from the outer edges of the TV.  I'm still playing with the wall-to-TV distance but playing with both has helped heighten the experience.I would still like to see an 85"" specific version of these lights produced as I would purchase them, moving my current set to the 65"" TV I have in another room. I'm still advocating having a true to size fit would allow for a tighter halo look around the borders rather than a ""glow"" from behind the screen. It would also increase the amount of color in the corners where currently, due to the length and placement of the light strips in my application, it is somewhat absent. Fortunately the lighting blooms enough from the surrounding strips that it's not totally void of light.As I continue to play with these lights I'll try to leave tips which have helped me attain a better overall experience.

  I have a 65"" Sony 850E, not the best, but middle of the pack for LED TVs.I was considering updating it as it is 3 years old and the newer TV ar a bit sharper and have new technology that upscales the picture a bit better. However after reading some reviews and watching a few YouTubes on improving your home viewing experience, the one thing that was touched on over and over was the reduction of eye strain when viewing a bright TV in a dark room. Digging further into the subject, most 'Experts' recommended using TV Backlights. Looking a bit more I found that there were a lot of choices out there, ranging from around $10 - $300+. After cutting through the price vs. performance of various products, it seemed to me that the static lights that either were just a single color or you had to use a remote or app to change the colors did not relieve the eye strain as well as active lights. Active lights are different because they use input from either the HDMI port or an external source, such as a camera to 'synch' the lights response to the active picture being shown on the screen. Philips Hue is a very good system that uses a HDMI hub to capture the incoming digital information to ensure that the light reacted quickly and smoothly to whatever was on screen. This option while fast and almost decorative, can be expensive as all parts, the lights and the hub are sold separately, the upside is that all Hue products can be synchronized to work together, meaning that your Hue light bulbs can be synched with you TV lighting system to have a more immersive viewing and gaming experience. Where they fall a bit flat, other than the cost, for me is the fact that your Streaming Apps that work directly on your smart TV will not trigger the lights synching with your screen, as it is not sending anything through the HDMI ports. Yes you can get a ROKU or Fire Stick, but then, what's the point of having a smart TV? Govee push the limit and the price point a but differently. They decided to have a small HD camera 'watch' the screen and respond based on what it 'saw'. Of course the other difference between Hue and Govee is install times and methods. Hue is basically a Plug & Play solution, where you just plug your cable, game console, blu ray player into Hue's HDMI hub and the hub into the TV, download the app onto your phone/tablet, setup the standalone lights and your done. Govee is a bit more involved, I would first remove everything from the box and plug the lights, camera and power into the small hub, make sure the lights all are on. Next, look at the little arrow on the LED strip and which way it runs, as it comes as a single segmented strip, use some painters tape to arrange the strip around the rear of your TV. This will make adjustments easier so that when you strip off the plastic covering the adhesive backing, you will be more confident about it's placement. You want to try to make sure the top and bottom part of the LED strip is as even as possible. There are four corner breaks on the strip, where it can be gently twisted and bent to provide better placement. Next you are supposed to place the camera on either the top middle or bottom middle of the TV, the bracket on the camera has a real good 3M adhesive already in place. I however did not want to stick anything to the top of my TV permanently and I have and XBox Kinect already up top on this type of bracket https://tinyurl.com/y687xus9So instead I used a small Command strip hook and loop on the top of my Kinect and on the camera and stuck it on top of my Kinect. I believe raising the camera height in this manner helps the camera to 'see' more of the screen and avoids issues of color responses that I have seen others complain about. After connecting the camera, LED strip and power to the hub, I used the 7 orange spongey squares to my screen, three on each side, especially the corners an the last one at the bottom middle of the screen. I downloaded the App on my Iphone and inputted access for my WiFi. Small concern here, most phones, tablets have 5ghz capability and benefit from the speed and less crowded bandwidth. However, Govee will only recognize 2.4ghz, so in order to use the WiFi connection, you will have to go into your phone setting and change the WiFi access to 2.4ghz, it will not connect otherwise. After you get your Govee app to see the backlights, you can now turn them on or off, change how and what colors the lights display, brightness and saturation of the lights as well as set 'scenes' for mood lighting. It also features a Game mode, which seems to force a faster response for the camera, where as the Movie mode, lets the colors transition more smoothly and seems to flow with the picture displayed. Next, with the TV off, you go into the settings icon, on the top right portion of the app and then choose, 'Calibration'. Just follow the instructions and try to make sure that you get all 7 orange squares within the 5 points that they give you. Also note, if you tend to watch black and white or monochrome older films and shows, the camera gets confused and will display the lights more towards the purple\blue end of the light spectrum, more purple as the screen shows blacks. There were complaints from early version that the device did not correctly interpret greens or orange colors, that seems to either have been fixed or the simple fact that I have my camera mounted about 7"" above the screen and the newer H6199 version has a 1080p camera.Final thoughts, after having these lights installed and active for over 2 weeks I think that I can honestly say, they do seem to decrease eye strain as I have had less headaches after late night movie watching. The screen seems bigger as the lights give the illusion that the action on the screen is flowing beyond it. It does add another dimension to gaming as in gaming mode the lighting changes as the gameplay changes creating a more immersive playing venue. While I will not take away anything from Philip Hue's bright and fast reactive system, $70 dollars is quite a bit of difference from Hue's costing $149 for the two light gameplay with hub base kit, and another $419 Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box. If you have the spare change laying around and you don't care about reactive lighting for your TVs built in smart apps, the Philips Hue is the better system.

  Easy to use, self explanatory really. The attached picture is actually of the cage around a tree in my yard so we don’t walk into it in the dark.  It’s on a side of the house where there are no lights so the picture is very representative of the brightness.  That side of the house gets full sun for 12 -14 hours (Texas) and the lights are still glowing when the sun comes up. Heat doesn’t bother them.  I have one set in a different area that have been in place for 3 years. The only thing that I have to do is occasionally change the rechargeable battery.

  After reading reviews from other brands that looked almost identical to the Sanjicha fairy lights (solar string lights), i decided to spend the extra couple of dollars for these.  And I’m glad I did!  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  The instructions were clear and precise.  Within ten minutes I was outside stringing the up in a tree in my backyard.  The on/off button is easy to find, and use.  The button next to it controls the 8 different twinkle modes.  They were charged already right out of the box.  I ordered the gold wire with warm white lights.  After it got dark and they started twinkling, my next door neighbor noticed them immediately, and texted how beautiful they were.  The very long wires are carefully wrapped around a piece of cardboard, so no tangled messes to deal with. Overall well made and sturdy.  Very pleased with this purchase!

  I do like the multiple function the copper wire isn’t as obvious during the day but definitely not as bright as shown I hung both strings Of lights giving me a total of 5  wires together for the space I had  as the picture shows you need a lot more lights to get your space brighter Can’t comment on long term only had them two days  but they showed up on timeHad to come back and update my review after a few days I noticed I was having to reset the mode every evening on one set of light I sent an email asking how to fix the problem Apparently there is no fix they are sending a new set of lights to replace they defective lights

  Update: amazing customer service! I didn't even reach out to this company but they reached out to me to ensure that I was satisfied with my lights. I mentioned one of them wasn't working right after a few days and they replaced it for me! I have had horror stories with other Amazon companies but this one is amazing. Lights are beautiful and stay on way longer than even the new solar lights in the ground I installed! They go on automatically and then seem to turn off in the early morning, so they last allll night! I highly recommend. I'll be purchasing more around the holidays!

  I bought two of these string lights for my backyard lighting project. The lights are very bright and they last for a long time! I absolutely love them. The wire is so easy to wrap around anything, on my tree and pergola, and it runs along the yard perimeter. It has different modes, and it is cool to change the mode frequently, and it changes the look in my backyard. They look so gorgeous at night time, the strings are almost invisible during daytime.The  only wish I have is for the solar panel to be mountable. Other solar lights I bought has a mountable option, in addition to pushing the pole to the soil/ground. This Sanjicha brand doesn't have the mount to install up on the fence, so I have to leave the solar panel on the ground. It'd be good to have both options.Anyhow, I am very happy with the lights because they are bright, long lasting, and super easy to wrap around anything!

  These lights were delivered on time and in new condition. They were easy to put together and set up. My ONLY issue is how the manufacturer wrapped the coil. It was IMPOSSIBLE to unravel this without undoing the entire light string. It was very frustrating. Aside from that, I set them up, and waited for sundown to see them do their thing. They are really pretty and I LOVE the different modes. I’m satisfied with this purchase.

  Loved the lights, just the right amount of brightness. Only issue was unwinding my 2nd light I spent 15 min trying to untangle the way it was wound. Threw it out wasn't worth the hassle.

  An extension cord, power extender, drop cord, or extension lead is a length of flexible electrical power cable (flex) with a plug on one end and ONE OR MORE sockets on the other end. This extension cord affords ONE socket and does the job at a reasonable price. Extension cords come in various colors, lengths, thicknesses and service duties. This is a dark black heavy gauge cord. Remember to select the correct length when ordering any cords/cables! If you found my review useful please click 'Helpful' below!

  Be careful ordering.  I ordered 3 of these, which are supposed have standard male and female ends.  By standard, I mean the male end could be plugged into any normal 3 prong grounded outlet in the United States.  And the female end should be able to receive any normal 3 prong grounded plug.  In fact, based on the item description and photo, you'd expect that the male end of this item could actually be plugged into the female end of this item.  What I received had the male end exactly as pictured, but the female end has three vertical rectangular slots (see photo).I submitted a ""return/replace"" request with Amazon and described the issue.  Quite promptly, I received a new package of 3 more cords, but to my dismay, they're exactly the same.  So I'm now in my second ""return/replace"" effort.  If I manage to get the correct item, I'll update my review accordingly.

  So something must have happened to my microwave when it was being created in the microwave factory. Obviously the incredibly short (like 1 inch) cord that came with my microwave must have been some gigantic oversight and break down in the quality control process. There's no way everything went smoothly if the end result was the pathetic cord attached to the bringer of my hot pockets. That said, this extension card has made my microwave whole again. It is no longer picked on by the other microwaves for it's short cord. My microwave no longer feels inadequate in its quest to reach a socket for electrical power. The quality and durable 3 foot extension cord that arrived in the mail has my microwave humming along nicely. The cord matches everything nicely and looks exactly like it's part of the original product. Nobody can tell it's an extension. If you too have an appliance that needs a little extra length, this is your extension cord (<-- not a euphemism).

  Needed a super short, 3 prong, outdoor rated extension cord to change the orientation of our pool pump plug-in because I upgraded to a smart outdoor plug-in that's mounted to a post on the underside of my deck railing and the transformer for the pool plug would be sticking out last the back of the plug-in.  I used this to mount the pool plug-in a little farther down the railing.  Works well, we've had a few storms so far and I haven't had any troubles with it.  The price isn't bad, but I would have liked to find something a little less.

  I had purchased one of the electric bug zappers to hand by the rear sliding doors. The only problem was that the power cord on it was only 2' long. I couldn't believe it. Who would make and sell a bug zapper with only a 2' electric cord? Any, I only need 3' more to reach the electric outlet and this 3' extension cord perfectly fit the bill. Not only was it a good fit, but it made it possible to turn the zapper on and off just by disconnecting the two cables. An excellent purchase overall.

  I purchased this 6 ft. 16 gauge 3 wire black extension cord. This cord seems well made and carries a UL certification. It's nice that they have a permanent tag attached indicating the 13A, 1625W capacity of the cord (right next to the UL holographic tag). This cord weighs 8.3 ounces, which is different than the 1.6 ounces they state on the Amazon page listing. Too bad, because a lighter weight would have been great for travel. For the price I don't think you could find a nicer cord than this.

  I originally purchased a more expensive LED light strip with remote control.  However it was returned because the lights did not reliably respond to the remote control and the electronics got extremely hot to the touch.I purchased these since everything was included and the price was very inexpensive.  Everything worked great!  The lights were very easy to install, they always respond to the remote control, and they don't get hot!  Excellent product and you cant beat the price.My only negative remark is that there are no instructions included on how to program your own scenes with the remote control.

   This lighting is quick and very easy to install. Just make sure that you clean the surface well, plan your project and apply the item only once. I do recommend installing the item in a location where it will be hidden when not in use. It can look a bit ""tacky"" if it is too noticeable when not in use. I have a very old stairwell that gets extremely dark at night. The last step, at the bottom, can be a mess as it seems to be a bit shorter and can cause a person to trip in the dark. 😡🤕 These lights make the stairwell safe at night. It also adds a little ""flavor"" to my century old house! I love it! 😀

  I wasn't sure how well these would work, but was pleasantly surprised.  I bought to backlight a custom headboard.  The LEDs were adhered directly to unfinished pine boards.  The adhesive is really strong and didn't have any problems sticking to the wood.  My kids love the color change features.  There is plenty of adjustability to the brightness.  I have tried the custom settings and probably won't.  The preset colors work well for my needs.  I've had these for 4 months now with no issues.

  The instructions are SO DANG SMALL! They are microscopic almost, printed on a piece of paper as big as a match box. Didn't even think these were instructions! So, watch closely, they're in there. Have a slick clean surface and double sided tape to make these stick on the wall, or desk or whatever you want them for. My teenager likes the remote control to flip thru the different colors & flashing speed options. He wants another set of these, since 16ft only covered 2 walls of his room. :) Maybe get the bigger strand by Minger.

  I was surprised to see all the negative reviews on this item ranging from missing parts, size too small, and lack of adhesion.  SCOTCH is a household name for good reason so I bought them to replace the pads on my dining room chairs.  Very happy with size (they are 1"" and round) and with the proper placement they adhered nicely.  FYI - place them on the feet of the chair and then sit on it for a few minutes while surfing facebook - do not move the chair during this time.  I recommend having a drink handy as well.  After a few minutes you are golden and should have a nice buzz on - repeat for all chairs followed by a dose of Tylenol for your future headache.  Seriously, these have been in place for months now with no issue.

  Felt pads were one of those things that I thought was a commodity - one brand was pretty much the same as another. Putting them on chair legs means that you'll be replacing them every couple of months, so I've had a chance to try out many different brands over the years, including many from local big box stores.I've found, though, that there are some differences among brands. The Scotch felt pads seem to have a more effective adhesive than other felt pads, so that I don't have to replace them quite as often. For me this makes up for any issues with slightly higher cost than other brands. If you're getting felt pads for low-use settings, any brand should be fine. If you want a step up in quality, though, these are great.

  These pads are being used on the bottom of wooden breakfast room chairs on a wood floor. They are easy to apply, but they have to be reset into place about every two weeks, as the adhesive is too puny to keep them affixed to the leg bottoms. In addition to frequently moving them back to the bottom, there is also the issue with adhesive on the floor (a Goo Gone job - a great product, by the way). This is a very annoying issue of constant maintenance. Scotch is a good brand, but these little devils have been a recurrent disappointment. As people age, getting down on the floor to reattach the pads and clean the floor becomes a hardship. My wife and I are not large (heavy) individuals and we strive not to slide the chairs any more than necessary with our weight on them. That notwithstanding, these pads do not stay in place, esp. the larger ones for the back legs.

  These pads are a bit more expensive but boy do they stick!  You learn quick not to put your finger on the sticky pad because it's hard to get off.  I used them before on chairs I recently refurbished and I had to use a hammer and chisel to get them off after 5 years of wear, to put the new ones on!

  You should know what to expect when you buy this or anything that simply tapes to the bottom of the chair legs.The truth is they should sell something like this with an actual bottle of adhesive - something more substantial that will fill in porous gaps and uneven areas, but they don't.  I got these fully expecting to adhere them to the bottom of my chairs with something more substantial.  No tape in the world was going to work, and when you buy something like this, that is essentially what it is - a double sided tape on the bottom of the felt.The adhesive itself would probably be just fine if each leg was perfectly flat, all four legs level to each other, and properly cleaned before applying.  Imagine taping this to the bottom of a perfectly flat piece of metal - I doubt they would come off anytime soon.  However on chairs this condition may not really exists - my chairs were particularly terrible both in the porousness of the wood in this area and the unevenness.  If left to its own devices - these pads would have very little area that was actually pressed between the floor and leg at any given time, and would tend to rock and re-position themselves off the leg quickly - as other users have noted.All I did was apply hot glue before pressing them on.  This helped fill the substantial gaps I had on my chairs and keep the pads more leveled.  Time will tell if they fall off on occasion, but I suspect this was a good work around for people having issues with them not adhering.Either way you can simply look at what the product is doing, taping felt to wood - and depending on your chair you may need to temper your expectations.

  I purchased these to put on the bottom of the legs of our wooden dining table and dining chairs. They adhered perfectly fine. They help decrease damage from pulling the chairs in and out. We have stone tiling in our kitchen so before I stuck these on, it would make a loud, unpleasant sound when pulling a chair. Now it is pretty quiet and no more damage on our new chairs. I will have to update later on down the road once it has gone through some wear and tear to see how it has held up. So far so good.

  Its pretty cool but for some reason the pods don't all fit at once. if you fill it up they crash together in the center and push each other out. You can balance them in there but you have to be sort of careful and at least one in each row will be poking out a quarter of an inch or so. That said, its cool to have next to the keurig and it spins nicely, seem well made excluding the design flaw.

  One of the strings of lights in this pack of two was incredibly dim and then one day it stopped working. Opening up the solar panel revealed that one of the diodes wasn't even soldered onto the board!!! On of the wires also easily came off of a solder point. There was also too much hot glue used to keep the board in place.I did like how the wire was thin and had a lot of different lighting modes and would turn on automatically at night. But only one of the string lights even worked. Not worth the price.EDIT: The seller was kind enough to offer a replacement for the string light that wasn't working but the replacement also became dim after about a month. Unfortunately, these are cheap lights that don't last for more than about a month or so outside in the sun.EDIT 2: The seller sent a replacement again. Hopefully the new one works. At the very least, I respect the seller's responses and willingness to try to fix the problem.

  Several settings, works great, charges during the day and comes on at dusk.  I hope they continue to last!  I bought 3 set (each box has two so 6 strings) and stuck the charger spike into my planter facing the sun.Update: On cloudy/rainy days the charge only lasts till about midnight.  On sunny days I'm not sure what time they go out but I see one or two of them still weakly on when I get up at 5:00AM.  This is perfect for me because I really just care about the evening.

  I purchased these lights to use outdoors year round.  The lights were nicely packaged and I found them easy to unwind to put them into place (I didn't experience any tangled wire! )  I installed the lights at approximately 7pm, with sunset to follow at 9:07pm.  To my surprise, when I went outdoors at 4am (total darkness) these lights were burning so brightly after just having 2 hours of daylight to charge! The mode button is super simple to operate to control solid or blinking lights.  I'm eager to see how these last throughout the summer and fall months.  I highly recommend these lights!

  These are the best string lights. I love the fact there are different modes to them. I had a set last year, which I used to look like water coming out of a watering can. I liked them so much, I bought two more strings. The ones I used from last year are still working and I just put a string around a pole that holds a birdhouse...love, love them. They cover a lot of area.

  I bought these for Christmas and yes, they’re still up. The lights are so nice and subtle that they provide a decorative addition to two trees that can withstand past the holiday season. For the price I thought that they would not last long, but I was proven wrong. One recommendation is to have an extra set of hands while installing as the wire can get tangled easily. Other than that, good purchase!

  The first is these lights are BRIGHT!! Never did I expect solar lights to be this bright. They are a wonderful bright white if that is what you are looking for. The second thing you need to know is that I would suggest making sure you know exactly where you want to put them and unroll them as you are placing them. If you unroll them all the way, then decide you don't want them where you put them, they become a long, tangled mess to deal with. It's not impossible to untangle them, but it is a chore. I am also not certain of the function of the modes. It seems I would choose one, but it would not stay on that mode so if that is important to you, read more reviews and see how others dealt with that issue. I've only had them a day so I may just need to work with them more.

  Previous headline:  ""Got the 2-pack.  One has no microphone audio.  Both have connection problems.""Original review:I ordered the 2-pack of Wyze Cam v2 for about $50.  Powered up the first one and connected to it via the Wyze app on my iPhone.  (Connecting means establishing a WiFi link from the phone to the camera so I can see its video, hear its audio, change its settings, etc.)  Sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes when I change the resolution or other setting the camera disconnects.  A few times I was completely unable to connect/reconnect until I restarted the iPhone app and/or cycled power to the camera.  Basically I found the connection process to be buggy and unreliable.  In addition, after testing for a while I realized I had no sound incoming from the first camera.  Seems like a hardware failure with the microphone.  So essentially the first camera is physically broken on arrival and needs to be replaced.I powered up the second camera of the 2-pack and had similar problems with connectivity but at least the microphone is working and I can hear incoming sound.  The connectivity problems persist with both cameras even with the camera firmware and iOS app updated to the latest versions and a 32GB microSD class 10 card installed in each one.Sadly, it seems you get what you pay for.  I've opened a support ticket with Wyze to see what they can do about replacing the camera with the bad microphone.  Based on how that goes I'll either keep them or return them to Amazon.UPDATE: I contacted support.  I told them what was wrong with lots of details.  They basically ignored the details and asked for everything all over again.  Told them again.  Sent more info during some back-and-forth.  Finally they said they'd put me in touch with their team for a replacement.  And then... nothing.  Haven't heard from them since.  Haven't gotten a replacement.  They completely dropped the ball.  So basically their customer service is on par with their product:  Cheap, shoddy and broken.  I'm going to return the product to Amazon and leave up this 1-star review so people will know what they're getting into.

  My rating is a compromise between value for money (hands down a 5+) and its usability (a three). First and foremost, this is NOT a security camera. In fact, Wyze states this clearly in their terms of service: “The products and services are not intended for use as security or life safety devices or services (such as a burglar alarm or monitoring system). Please do not rely on the products and services for any such critical uses.” So that said, adjust your expectations to conform.But for the price, it’s a really nifty monitoring system for non-critical applications, and a lot of thought and design have gone into the product (again, considering the price). Given that you have the correct wi-fi system, the setup is easy and straightforward. The camera is as described with good color and reasonable resolution. On a smart phone, the image looks crystal clear. However, on closer zoom examination, the transmitted image is noticeably degraded with compression artifacts, and thus the ability to recognize faces, license numbers, and the like will be somewhat limited to subjects within 10 or 15 feet of the camera. The night vision works well (black and white), and the built-in infrared lights nicely illuminate a typical room (of course, getting darker with distance). Note that you can’t point the camera through a window at night and use the built-in infrared lights – they reflect horribly on the glass. But the app allows you to turn them off. The microphone and speaker provide intelligible audio within a reasonably sized room. It’s not high quality, but it’s usable.The free cloud file service is a good idea, but for any reasonable use, you will want to get the optional on-board micro-SD card. The cloud storage drawback becomes very apparent due to the 12-second limit on uploaded files coupled with what they call the five-minute cooling off period between uploads. Thus, when some event triggers an upload, such as a person breaking in to your house, the recording ends before the real event occurs (such as that person rifling through all your belongings). I suspect the ‘cooling off period’ is really just a euphemism for data throttling to keep on-line storage to a manageable size. But with the on-board micro-SD card, that problem is solved – it’ll keep recording as long as it sees something happening. (But pay attention to the specs for the card – I bought the Wyze card just to be safe since they guarantee it.)The camera is also capable of time lapse video via an easily configurable app interface. However, I find that it’s buggy and unreliable since the resulting videos are often not accessible via the app. I’ve seen other on-line complaints about this, and the most common fix is to reformat the SD card. Unfortunately, that fix isn’t permanent (in my experience), and the problem isn’t apparent until after you’ve spent hours or days hoping to capture some one-of-a-kind event.The camera is designed to be used indoors. Some users, me included, use it outdoors. I purchased a tight-fitting enclosure to mount up under an eave, which ought to protect them from direct rain and snow, but I don’t have the expectation that they will last for years in that configuration.I had one encounter with their support team. I submitted a request to their on-line customer service system, and a knowledgeable and friendly tech responded within a day. The whole issue was settled with a couple of guided troubleshooting exchanges, and I received a new camera in less than a week from the first contact.In summary, it’s a very cost-effective and useful system for non-critical applications. The system and app seem to be a work in progress, and occasional problems elicit the wrath of users, but the company is generally responsive to problems. So for watching the dogs at home, documenting a storm, etc., it’s a good product. The Wyze development team has done a good job given the cost limitations, and I have subsequently bought three more.

  Ok my family has an Arlo, Nest, and now Wyze. Nest was my first camera at $180 for 1 camera. I hated that it didn’t record for long unless you paid for the service and also that it wasn’t wireless. The Arlo I installed in my moms home it records for a week is wireless and rechargeable, but comes with a hefty price tag of $600 for 3 camera set up. I wanted 2 more cameras and saw that the Wyze had good reviews. I thought for $25 a camera how could I lose and I’m so glad I did I bought it. These are for my first impressions. I haven’t played with it long enough to really give you more detail. There is a user-friendly ap and I have an IPhone XS the use of the ap and the quality of the pictures is pretty damn good for $25. Check out my pictures. I do have the Wyze camera and Nest camera behind glass windows. For the reviewers who complained that it doesn’t turn off and it records them naked....look I have dogs and I primarily use this to check on my new puppy. I wouldn’t install a camera where I would be walking around naked. Whether I could turn off the system or not.  Sure it can deter burglars but I have a 90lb German Shepherd whose bark can make your skin crawl. I don’t necessarily need to record but this camera has that option with the additional purchase of an SD card. I have to dock it a bit because it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the Arlo. It isn’t wireless and it doesn’t record the way the Arlo does but I don’t really need that option. Look where this camera lacks it makes up in price. I just ordered 2 more. Also too bad it’s not for outdoor use but my cameras I mount inside in front of windows. It can reach super high temperatures where I live and I don’t want to risk my Nest came melting on me. I installed a set of baxia solar powered lights and for under $200 I have a home security system with 4 cameras, recording capability and excellent image quality.

  One job. That's all you had. And for three months you did it like a pro. And then you went on strike. Were my sponges too dirty for you? Were you averse to my relationship with Brussels sprouts?I'm not sure. All I know is after three months or so the suction cups holding the tool stopped sucking. I now have the device sitting on a ledge over my sink.Allow me to sum this up. This product started sucking when it stopped sucking.

  This is one of those cheap purchases you make that pay off big.  I honestly can't imagine my life without this product. I go to other people's houses and judge them when I see their sponges, just LYING THERE on the counter or the bottom of the sink.  What are you, an animal? Get some self respect! Don't you realize what is happening to that sponge? If you're lucky you can nuke it in the microwave long enough to bring it back to life, but otherwise, that thing is a soaking bacteria garbage barge. Put it in its place! ...and then I realize that this person's sponge doesn't have a place, because they were never smart enough to buy a suction cup sponge holder that helps dry your sponge out and keeps your sink looking orderly. Their sponge is homeless and their sink is a disgrace.. Don't be like them. Live your life like its worth a damn.

  I've been using my plastic sponge holder for years. I just remodeled my kitchen and wanted to buy a new holder to replace the plastic one.  I got it about 5 hours ago and had to stick it back on the sink at least 6 times so far. My husband also saw that it fell and he stuck it back on too.  I always wet the suction cups and normally I have to peel them off the sink to clean behind them. Unfortunately,  I can't use the suction cups from the plastic holder, the back is different and they won't fit on the new one.  What a waste of my money,  don't spend yours on this, find another one.

  I wanted something to hold a sponge and metal scrub pad so that they didn't make a mess of the back of my sink, and don't sit in a pool of dirty water.  This solved the problem for me.  It's large enough to hold those two items, and yes, it does stay stuck to the side of my steel sink (at least so far, after a couple of months).  It doesn't rust, it's solid, and I recommend it.Update:After several months of use I'm still happy with this, although I've found that in order to keep the suction cups working well, I have to clean them once in a while.  Not a lot to ask.Second update:I've been using this for a year on my stainless steel sink. About once every couple of weeks it slides down. I wash the suction cups and the part of the sink where I want it to stick and it's good for another couple of weeks. The suction cups are definitely flattening, though, and if I can find some reasonably priced replacements I'll get them.Third update:After about a year the suction cups were flat and would no longer stick. I removed them and found two small suction cups with steel hooks at the hardware store and hung the basket on the hooks. Works fine and should be good for at least another year.

  I wasn't sure this would work because my sink is pounded copper so its not smooth. I found that even though the whole suction cup wouldn't fit on the lip of my granite countertop enough of it does in order to stick. It works well enough that it has only fallen off when I've accidently wacked it with a pan.

  UPDATE: I've used this method on 3 different sinks and had great results on all of them!I bought this knowing full well that the suction cups were the weak point in the design. I figured that I would eventually come up with a better mounting system since the suction cups were working for only a few minutes before giving up, even without the weight of the sponge.Since I had no immediate ideas (well, none that worked) I just left it behind faucet leaning on the backsplash. Last night when I got home, I noticed that my fiancée had moved it to a very peculiar spot. It was in the corner or the sink and it was holding strong.I just moved it to the opposite corner this afternoon, so that it wouldn't be under the drain pan, and I can't believe how good it's holding. It was a little tricky to get both suction cups to stick at first but I figured out a little trick. I was able to stick one side and then slide it over to where it's flat enough to stick the other side. Then you just slide it back over to center it. Be careful that you don't dig the holder into your sink and scratch it while sliding it back and forth.

  So the suction cups don't work. I love the idea of this holder, but it's cheaply made. I bought one for Christmas and found out that one of the suction cups were bent and would not stick at all. So I returned it and it was replaced free of charge, however again one of the suction cups loses it's stickiness with in a couple of hours. I'm not going to waste my time by re-ordering this one or returning it. I think I'll have to go buy additional different suction cups for it.

  I could not get this thing to stick to anything.  Tried wetting the suction cups first as directed, stuck for about one minute then fell off or slid down.  Tried it dry...same thing.  Total waste.  I tried sticking it to my granite backsplash..no good, to my stainless steel sink (brand new), no good, to my dish holder/drainer, no good.  Don't buy it :(.

  I was excited to purchase these filters, as they were cost effective so I could afford to replace them more often. I put the first one in shortly after receiving them a little less than a month ago. It looked fine and fit as expected in my furnace. Fast forward a few weeks, and my house is cold. I have the thermostat set at 69 & the house won't get above 62. I double checked all my windows and doors. I adjusted the thermostat. I was at a loss. As a last ditch effort before an HVAC appointment, I checked the filter (that I had replaced only a few weeks ago) & found it jammed in the furnace, with the wires bowed. When I finally got it out, I saw the filter was damaged and plugging the intake. I replaced it with a different filter and within an hour my house was warm again. Spend a few extra bucks and get a different filter! Not worth the extra stress and potential danger of a defective air filter.

  In every other disposable furnace filter I've ever used, the support grating looks like metal chicken wire and when installed the grating goes on the side where the blower fan is.  The grating usually prevents the actual filter media from getting pulled towards the blower.These have it the other way and don't use metal.  There's thin strips of plastic every 1/8"" going from one side to the other and the plastic strips appear to be melted to the filter media at every pleat.  The attachment of the plastic strips to the filter media is quite strong in my limited and unscientific tests.  It should work fine but I was confused at first because the air flow arrow on the frame appears to be pointing in the wrong direction compare to every other filter I've ever used, but I'm pretty sure the arrow is correct, this is just a new way of supporting the filter media.Other than that, it's a basic filter.  The size is almost exactly the claimed size which is nice as it fits more snugly into my furnace.  Some of the cheap filters are up to 1/4"" thinner than claimed and 1/2"" less in width and height, but these aren't like that.UPDATE July 8th 2019: After only 2 months installed in my furnace the first filter frame has bent along the bottom edge, see pics.  I've never had a filter bend like this.  These filters have a very weak frame.  I'll be changing them out every 1 month now until I use up the pack of them then not buying this style filter again.  Sadly it's getting harder and harder to find basic low restriction filters which aren't cheap junk, even with the 3M branding on them.

  Great 3M quality and price, I waited to see how they work before reviewing. They work great! The thing to know is that  they are using a new filter support design. Instead of a metal grid on the backside of the filter 3M is using plastic strips on the front side of the filter media. These strips are attached to every pleat every inch or two and will face away from your blower, the airflow arrows are correct on the package. This seems to be the problem some people are having.  If installed backwards the pleats will collapse when the blower comes on and cause airflow problems. Installed correctly the Pleats keep their shape and everything works fine.  I don’t know why they redesigned it I’m sure it’s a money-saving thing but it is what it is. These are still great filters, I will happily reorder these.

  I find it difficult to believe that these were made by 3M. I believe they are knock offs. They are not up to normal 3M quality specs.  Sizing is off, they are flimsy, and the quality varies from filter to filter. They have a completely different air flow and design from any other filter I have seen.  3M would have represented them correctly. I am not surprised other reviewers have had problems with them.  But you get what you pay for.  If they last, I expect them to last half as long.  I’ll use them, but will look for a more reputable supplier who will fairly represent their product next time.

  3M makes a great product this is a filter that needs replacing often. That is because it is not a hugely thick HEPA type. If you have extreme allergies or need a HEPA then you should get another type of filter if you keep it clean house these last between one and two months and they do a great job. I can't believe some of the stupid reviews I've seen from stupid people. I work 42 years for major airline, and several years part-time with a friend that had a heating and air company. I rate these filters as the best filters for the money.

  I was very nervous about using these given the mixed reviews, so hopefully this helps anyone on the fence about using them. I bought two different colors, the gray and the white. The gray definitely has a slight blue-ish cast, so if that is going to bother you use a different brand. The white is a true bright white without any ivory or yellow. Do not count on this matching your existing grout. You will not be able to just touch up a few areas. Just plan on doing the entire room.As to usage, I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom plus a little of the shower with one pen. The shower floor has small hex tile with larger grout lines so that took a little over two pens. Some tips: shake very well when first taking out of the package and any time you start working again after a pause. Depress the tip several times on to a paper plate or directly onto the grout line to get the paint flowing. Press very lightly when going over the grout. The tips lasted almost all the way to the end of my project. If the coverage starts to thin, pause and depress the tip a few more times. I would do about a 1x1 foot area, then pass over it lightly with a damp paper towel to get any overage off the tile. It is pretty forgiving and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely on the tile. If the tip gets too ragged you can pull it out (I used the damp paper towel) and flip it around. This was not a quick task but it went faster than I thought it would.I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!

  This is one of those products that has a lot of upsides but several downsides. To preface, I have a roughly 20-square-foot white tile floor in my apartment bathroom. When I moved in, the grout was very discolored and made the tile look dirty. I was extremely skeptical about this product, but it was a reasonably priced solution and a top seller on Amazon, so I gave it a shot.I followed the very simple directions on the pen (clean floors, remove cap, shake pen, use), and was initially amazed by the results. My nearly gray tile grout was being transformed back to white. Although, after I got through about 6 square-feet of tile, the pen tip started to fall apart. Was it still usable? Yes. Did it hinder the quality of the paint job? Also yes.Additionally, the paint ran out much quicker than expected. I was able to get a single coat on the entire tile floor, but the 60 meters of coverage they claim is a little far fetched.Nonetheless, my tile floors look good. A couple tips (no pun intended): get two pens because the coverage is less than advertised, apply 2 coats, REALLY clean the floors before you start (I didn’t deep clean nearly enough and the grime made the paint job much harder), consider another solution unless you have white tile as well (I feel as if this pen would not be great if you needed to be precise), and don’t push as hard on the tip to increase the pen’s longevity.Hope this helps! Still a good product, just a couple things to keep in mind before you buy.

  We just bought a house, and one of the biggest eyesores was the downstairs toilet area because the grout and tiles are so old and miscolored.I'm so glad I tried out these pens, it covered almost the entire bathroom floor (and probably could have colored more, but I was being fairly careless and was wiping up large areas of paint when wiping off tiles).Unfortunately, after a week the coloring seemed to go away some. I am not sure if the pain 'soaked in' to the grout or if we were just too quick to put the rugs back over top.Overall, though, it looks marvelous! Up close, it's a little iffy looking but what guest is going to be that close to really notice?*Update: we went to Lowes and bought some of their grout pens when these started to run out. Theirs had a harder/wider tip, which got more paint on the tile, but overall seemed to cover better.*

  These things are awesome!  I cleaned my bathroom tile grout first because the lady that lived there before me really let it go.  A few places stayed stained and I was worried it wouldn't cover them, but all grout areas are bright white and look new now!  The first picture is showing as I was cleaning the dirty grout.

  Bought to clean up the pitted/cracked shower grout in an apt.  If I owned the place, I'd have properly re-grouted & sealed.  For the price, this did the trick & made the shower look sharp/clean.  The paint dispenses easily & is pretty simple to apply evenly (and if you screw up, just use sponge to wipe off where you colored outside the lines).  No idea how it'll hold up over time, but it made it through its first cleaning test (spray down with Kaboom tile cleaner)  For my situation (i.e. it's an apt, so not willing to put in the time or $ to fully re-grout), it worked.

  This is the BEST for tying trees and vining vegetables! It's custom fit, it's soft on the underside and it won't rub vines raw like twine. I cut each strand slightly bigger and loosen the Velcro as the plant's steams grow thicker. If you've ever been out in the garden and have been frustrated with tying knots or damaged steams, this is a game changer.  Plus, it's reusable each season!

  I am using this velcro to tie up my tomato plants. This is my first time growing any kind of plant so this is my first time staking a plant. Many people told me to use old t-shirts to tie my tomato plants. I chose to use these instead and I am very happy that I did I got the large roll for less than $8 and I cut Iength needed with my scissors I put  the soft side against my tomato plant and the velco on the outside. These hold a lot of weight. I will definitely repurchase after I've used all of this roll. I was debating whether or not to get the velcro or a little round plastic clips. I'm glad I chose the velcro that way I can choose any length that I need even if I need it to go around 2x4 and the tomato plant it's no problem. I saved most of the velcro  form last year. I will use again.

  I go through a roll of this velcro tape every summer.  They are handy not only for tying up vines, but securing hanging items from blowing around too much in a storm (like my windchime) and for securing wires (which are on items like an outdoor fountain).  I also use the wrap in the fall when bundling up the tender plants in preparation for winter (like my bamboo and Chilean rhubarb.)  The tape stays put, can be reused multiple times, does not cut into the stalk of the plant and is easily trimmed to size.  It does not deteriorate outdoors despite rain, sun, wind and snow.  Highly recommend.

  I use this for loads of things! Now I wish it came in different colors.I started using it in the garden to hold up tomato and bean plants, then migrated to train indoor plants (it nearly camouflages itself), and now use it for almost anything I used to use twist ties or elastic bands for.The ones I use outdoors have lasted thee years so far and still can be adjusted. They are gentle and don’t strangle plants and other things (like string and wire does).It’s easy to cut and adjust, doesn’t stick to everything ir touches, can be washed, and looks nice.Maybe best of all, my mom, who has severe arthritis in her hands, can easily use this without pain or struggle.The first time I bought it was at a garden center, so my mind was stuck in the gardening tunnel for awhile. But really, it’s got infinite possibilities.Don’t expect the same kind of strength that the usual Velcro has, though. It does the job it’s meant to do and a little more, and what more can you ask?

  This is my go to for training plants on totems or supports for my houseplants! You just cut as you go and you don't need very much with each use.  It can be used for branch support training on totems & I've also previously used it to support a broken stem. I've never been disappointed, it's a great product that stands up well to wear, water, potting medium etc this is as far as an indoor atmosphere.  I've never use this product on outside gardening.

  I have been buying this off and on over the years, and its GREAT. The best thing for plants, and staking them up, or typing errant vines, or whatever!  It has just the right amount of stick. Can be removed easily if you need to, but it holds wonderfully.  It is kind of plants, unlike using something that cuts into the vines. Its gentle and soft.  What a simple, yet wonderful invention! I can't tell you how many plants I've used this for over the years. Highly recommend!

  I am an avid gardener, and have been looking for a good way to stake various plants, shrubs, and flowers. I have been buying the large rolls of twist-tie material for years, and using that to hold various plants up. But, the twist-ties also cut into the stems of whatever you are staking, sometimes even breaking the stem.I was not aware that this stretchy tape existed until I performed a search on Amazon. I have now used it on a few plants, it is far superior to the twist-ties. This plant tie is stretchy, much wider than the twist ties, and easier to use. It can be stuck to itself, just like Velcro.  But, I live in a very harsh climate area and did not completely trust that just sticking the tape to itself would survive this climate. I went ahead and tied the tape, I feel more certain that the ties will not come lose when they are tied together.  However, the tape does seem to stick together easily, perhaps those in milder climates would experience no issues with the stick together method.This tie material also has another advantage, it will stretch as the plant grows, another advantage over the twist tie system. I am pleased with this product, but only time will tell much about its durability. I will write an update after this tape has been in use for a longer period of time. Until then, this seems to be a nice and easy way to ensure that certain plants remain in the upright position.

  I'm doing reforestation work with a few thousand small trees, and these ties, combined with lengths of split bamboo, are an easy way to keep the trees straight and supported.  Easy to cut and put in place.  I bought several smaller roles before I started buying this larger size (for a small cost savings) and they've been great.  High recommendation for use in securing small trees, vines, small branches, etc.  I've also been using them too keep roles of extension cord, rope, etc., neat and untangled.  High recommendation!

  I live in an old home and we are at the point in life where we have done all the big repairs we are going to do. We have holes in quite a few screens which my spouse promised to fix with his mystical screen hole patching prowess. That was years ago and I’m tired of getting eaten alive. I bought a roll of this and in 10 minutes every screen was patched.This product cuts cleanly even with mediocre scissors. It adheres to the existing screen neatly and without a lot of pressure or fuss. I’d say not to worry too much about which color you choose as this product is quite obvious in use. It is really not going to blend. However I don’t care; my screens no longer are mosquito boulevards and the product stays put. I’m thrilled, one more job off the list.

  I read a bunch of the reviews before purchasing. Yes, you can see the repaired spots, bur a few minor repairs here and there does not bother me. My husband went around and cleaned the spots on the outside of the screens where we were going to apply patches. He first did one on a bedroom screen and was not crazy about the look. He used one piece to cover 2 holes, so more repair mesh was used. I would have done them separately. I did our patio screen later and used smaller pieces in just the spots where a mosquito could get through. He agreed the smaller patches were less noticeable. I was really happy that the plastic backing was easy to remove and the adhesive was very sticky. We chose to put our patches on the outside in case the cats were apt to mess with them and because others said it looked better from inside the house if the patches were applied outside.

  This worked well for repairing a 3 inch cut in one of my screens.  It was easy to use and cut with a regular pair of scissors, and the adhesive was perfect.  It was very easy to see, especially on the side that I had taped, but looked better from the outside.  I wish it blended in slightly better, but it was a lot cheaper than replacing the whole screen so 4 stars.  I think it’s best use is holding a screen together for those small issues until it gets to the point that the whole screen needs to be done—a temporary fix for minor issues.

  Holy cow! This stuff WORKS! I had been using regular packing tape to patch up my screen door that was riddled with holes and tears.. but those mosquitoes were making their way in.. and it looked terrible. I picked up a roll of this just to check it out.. and, man, the repair is practically like I installed a new screen! I did follow one other's review here about installing it ON THE OUTSIDE.. that definitely was true. But the door looks MUCH more normal now.. with not a single weak spot. I thought it was going to be tape with the net pattern printed on.. IT'S REAL NETTING with adhesive on one side.. so it really is a solid repair! Highly recommend!

  Good stuff! I had hoped for something that was very adhesive, and this is it. I was replacing screens and since I am not a professional at that I ended up tearing the screen at the spline in places. I used this to cover those points and seal it off. This is exactly what I needed. I had to cut it in half to get the width I needed, but that was easy. So is the application. The backing is easy to get off and it presses right in to place, and stays. It might not match the exact color of the screen, but it is sealed, and beats throwing the whole screen away because I screwed up.

  Love it, it took 10 minutes to fix four screens instead of hours of sewing patches. It is great for small patches, not for large ones. It doesn't let air flow through so if you have a large patch, put a piece of regular screen over area to be patched and use this on the outer edges and it works fine

  I have had a few rips in my screens around the house. I decided to get this tape to stick around the rips. However, no matter how I tried, the adhesive would never stick to the screen. Moreover, even if I just left it on the screen, they are extra opaque which makes the screen look worse. I've taken a look at the few images users have left and they look so unprofessional. Especially if you're proud of your house.Invest in a screen repair kit. It costs less! Takes about the same amount of time to take out and put in a new screen as the time I spent looking up a kit and writing this review (slight exaggeration) . I wish I knew about screen replacement kits before I bought this product. I hope this helps anyone investing in this.

  My ONLY issue with this product is that the mesh of the tape is slightly smaller than the mesh of my windows, so it doesn't blend it very well. But, it's better than a hole and cheaper than replacing the screen and it still lets air through, so I am very happy.

  We have bought an Intex pool for the last 5 years for the kiddos to splash in.  The last 2 years they went super cheap (underweight fillter, poor design, etc) so we went looking for a replacement.  This pool fit the bill well.When we pulled it out I was a bit concerned that it did not seem ""substantial"" enough but with a filter that runs super quiet (about half as loud as Intex) and a design that has stood up to months of abuse, I am very happy with this purchase.As with any pool, you need to have a floating cholorinator or some other chemical system otherwise it will get cloudy.  But after the failures of the Intex models. I was very pleased by this filter system.  It quickly cleared the cloudiness and kept the water well circulated with the barest amount of chlorine.It looses one star because after 3 months of use it is starting to sag a bit more then the Intex did but by this point last summer we had abandoned our Intex because the filter broke.So, all in all, very pleased.  Good choice.Update - we had some leaking issues after about 2 months and Summer Waves' Customer Service was amazing.  Not only were they incredibly friendly (and US based!!!) but they did a great job fixing the issue at no cost to me.All in all, this is our new go to pool.

  We wanted a pool for the summer without spending a lot of money. I was disappointed how expensive pools were (probably due to increased demand from the effects of COVID19), and we ended up getting this one for about $180-$190 shipped. It doesn't look very sturdy in most people's photos, so I thought it was going to be a piece. Thankfully, I was wrong! This pool is so much nicer than what I thought we were getting. I still don't know if it'll last more than a season, but we are happy with what we got. It was easy to set up. We followed the instructions for the filter because of some reviews that said it burnt out right away. Ours has been working great for two hours now. The instructions to say to run it 2.5 hours a day, so that's what we intend to do. We're very happy so far!Update: We've had our pool for one month now, and we're still happy with our purchase. We ended up buying a pool cover, chlorine tablets for the filter, test strips to make sure the chlorine is at a safe level, extra filter cartridges, and a shock treatment. Also, we bought a vinyl patch kit. Why a patch kit? Well, we got a hole on the rim of our pool, and it started to deflate! We initially patched it with flex tape that we had, which worked for a few days but eventually let air out. We re-patched it with flex tape a couple more times while we waited for the vinyl patch kit to arrive. It's been patched with the vinyl patch it for about a week now and is doing fine. So, you may want to consider having a vinyl patch kit on hand just in case you get a hole in the rim of your pool, too.

  I  purchased one of these pools as a replacement for one I had already owned  that I had purchased from big lots for a cheaper price.  I had no problems with that pool  until it had gone algae in it and when I emptied it and send it out to dry my dogs ruined it. So I purchased the same pool on Amazon for more money because the local stores had run out of inventory.  I set the pool up filled it with water leaked all over my backyard. The company sent me another one.  Set the pool up filled it up, it too had a leak.  Finally I was sent one more pool. It's set up perfectly, filled up perfectly and after one usage it began to leak. I will never buy a Summer Waves product ever again.I am also concerned about the company that supplies the pools.  None of the pools that were sent to me came in your original summer waves packaging. They all had been repositioned into new cardboard boxes.of the pools so I don't know if the pools came direct from the manufacturer.

  We ordered this on July figuring it was so hot we could use it through August. The pool had a leak somewhere and the top inflatable portion wouldn't inflate. We had put water in it already. When we called there was a whole list of checks to follow, one being putting food coloring in a full pool to see where the leak was... Really? Then empty all the water and fix it ourselves? Besides the top rim not inflating. We couldn't just return it for one that didn't leak. It's a big item and for the $50 or so bucks, not worth the aggravation of arguing with them.

  Easy to do.  Gaskets for filter are cheap. Both intake and outlet leaked. Would highly recommend using some type of adhesive/sealant between the gaskets and pool surface. Also keep in mind that if you live in a hot climate, the water quickly becomes the temperature of a hot tub. Mine has been up for a day and too hot to be in. (SC)

  This tap measure is just what I wanted. My last one, different brand , just snapped, so I thought I'd have to shell out another 25 bucks for a new one. Came across this Komelon ,and it not only has the self stop feature, but also the retract button that won't smack you in the face. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, for one reason. The hard plastic packaging. There are layers upon layers of this material, and it takes forever to get it off. I needed scissors and a utility knife to get it out. And it was very dangerous, because of the sharp edges from the plastic and tools, could have very easily cut myself. I was thoroughly ticked off by the time I was done. The hardest part was getting the belt clip free, as it is swathed above it, on the sides, and below it where it's screwed in place. I can't believe some moron came up with this design, and other morons approved it. There have to be dozens of easier ways to package this tape measure, like maybe a cardboard box, but they picked this one. There's no way I'll buy another when this one bites the dust, unless they change the packaging. I'd rather pay the extra money, than to go through the grief of opening this one.

  I bought this tape mainly because it's an autolocking tape to use on small jobs and because of its size and weight. I'm very happy with that. It feels good in the hand, is very light.The main numbers are relatively large and easy to read. Part of having a small, light tape is having a small tape blade, so the numbers and other markings are also smaller. If you use it for difficult jobs, expecting to have a long tape standout and large numbers, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want a tape that you can easily carry and use for small jobs, this one is a nice one. The autolocking feature is well worth the price of the tape alone, to me. I just love not having to fuss with trying to lock a tape, especially when you're trying to move quickly.

  I own several of these tape measures. They are cost efficient, and well-made. The tape is medium duty, and you can take it out about 6ft or so before in snaps over. I appreciate the self-lock feature, and it retracts smoothly. The retracting mechanism feels solid, and I don't anticipate it failing anytime soon. As long as Komelon continues to put forth quality tools and a decent price point, I will continue to be a customer. Definitely Recommend!

  Komelon had the 1st process to effectively laminate Teflon to measuring tapes many decades ago. This is a great tape for 30%-50% less than brand/known names, but meets or exceeds their performance. Large numbers, easy to read yellow black tape. Good rigidity when extended. Long lasting, smooth and effective Teflon coating. Moderate weight on the belt for a 25 foot tape indicating good steel thickness overall. Sturdy, easy find fluorescent green case with rubber padding and comfort contours makes for a nice working tape. We replaced our favorite decades-old Komelon measuring tape that a careless friend nicked with a circular saw on a cutting table...  highly recommended for price, function, durability and value.

  There are certainly less expensive surge suppressors out there, but these are very well made and well worth the price. I always prefer the angled plug and recommend them over the standard outlet to ensure you get and maintain a solid connection - anything less can defeat the purpose of using one IMO. The braided cord is a nice feature and a lot more flexible than the standard cord normally used. It makes it much easier to bundle up and wire tie any excess when mounting them under a desk like in my application.Some of the nicest surge suppressors I have ever purchased. I can give these my highest recommendation without hesitation. If and when I need more, I will be buying these again.

  Overall I like these. It's very well priced for a 2-pack, and the flat (and angled) plug is great for outlets sitting behind dressers/beds/other furniture. The sockets on the surge protector are decently tight but not excessively so compared to an APC I bought recently. The fabric (nylon?) sleeving on the cord is a nice touch, although the choice of a grey pattern seems odd vs black, given the black surge protector.I have only two minor complaints* The reset/off switch is a little easier to trigger than I would have liked. It's not to the point where I'm worried about accidentally setting it off, but it does feel lighter than other ones I've tried* The sockets don't have covers, so it's easy for dust and other stuff to fall into unused outlets. I knew this when I purchased itAs for actual surge protection, I'm not equipped (or knowledgeable enough) to rate this, but I'm hoping it actually works.

  I have a heavy printer on a stand with outlet directly behind it. Added an expansion outlet for printer and other items. Printer cable and another are very thick with very deep plug ends. So my stand would be a good 5-6"" or so from the wall. Always something falling behind it and the only way to get it back was to move the printer (80#) and the stand (very heavy). AAAAGGGHHHH!I chose this over flat outlets because I'd still have the depth of the thick cord and plug in. This item has a 'flatter"" plug than most. And I can set the strip on printer stand and plug everything in. It is close enough to the wall I don't have the worry of anything dropping behind it. And I love that it has surge protection and USB ports, very handy. Eliminates a few items I'd had plugged in and I don't have to charge phones and tablet one at a time because their plugs take up most of outlet space. Being long makes it easier to plug in odd sizes, I can still use the other plugs. And it feels very solid - I'm happy with it.The only thing that would make it perfect, is to make this so it plugs in with the cord running UP instead of down. Every place I have space trouble needs the cord going UP not down.'

  Purchased these as I was upgrading my work/gaming area and wanted enough power strips to handle current and future electrical needs.  The units are great on multiple levels as they have an offset plug so the other outlet isn't blocked by the cord.  The cord itself, a good 5' has a braid covering opposed to the plastic covering making it sooooooo much easier to manipulate.  The unit(s) themselves have 2 USB ports each to accommodate  any dedicated  appliances.  This is in addition to 4 three prong outlets.  They are surge protected which is nice on top of a circuit breaker system installed at the residence.  The lights are a nice, subtle green color that don't light up the room unlike some other power strips.  Wished I had seen these earlier.

  This set of power strips is well made and great value for the price. It has a long cord and its braided design seems to be more durable than the conventional plastic ones. I am currently using one in my living room with 1 more to spare.  has been using it for almost a month now, so far no issues..happy with the purchase...

  So I bought these last July. One of them has quit working & I contacted customer support. They immediately refunded half the purchase price. Originally I had thought they were blowing me off (thus my original one star review) but you contact them through Amazon then the response comes via email. Seems odd. Anyway these things work great until they don't. Honestly I would have rather gotten a replacement since now I will have to buy another one.

  I bought these to mount to a utility cart so I'd have power and USB charging capability, I saw this quote on the description, ""with right angle plug; 2 Keyhole mounting tabs for installation in a wide variety of applications."" and dumbly assumed it would be mountable.Apparently in China they use screws with no head or something I'm not familiar with, but as you can see there is no slot inside for the head of a screw to grab on to and hold, someone forgot to create a mold with the proper slot for mounting. Now I'm going to have to disassemble and make my own mount, something I was avoiding, hence the purchase.Not worth the money or the time.

  Ok, I had NO IDEA how well these worked!!!!  We have had a scorpion problem in our home, here in Kingman, AZ, for quite some time.  When I got stung in my bed at 3 a.m., I invested in tons of bug spray, and this flashlight.The type of scorpion we have here is the ""bark scorpion"", and BOY DO THEY GLOW when this light hits them.  I could see them from across the yard!  A good 20 feet away!!!!  I feel safer with this light than I do in the daytime!  I'm totally freaked out now, because we found scorpions all over the foundation of our house, crawling in-and-out underneath the stucco.  We killed at least 15 the first night!!!!  We also found a little one inside the house.I'm writing this review, because I don't think I'll sleep tonight :(. I would highly recommend this light.  It's like a spotlight!  It's totally my new favorite toy!!!

  This thing is so good. It shows every single stain over the years where our dog peed when he was a puppy and still having accidents on the carpet. We thought we cleaned but you can clearly see all the spots. It also shows where dust is hiding that you don't even see when the lights are on. So in conclusion, this UV light is almost too good. It shines brightly over a large area at least 6 feet away.  Now I can never lie on the carpet again cause i know where all the invisible stains are. They should sell this as a bundle with a carpet steam cleaner. Ordering two more as gifts.  Haha!

  I originally purchased this to go along with my halloween costume as I was an agent from CSI. But, one day my husband and I decided it would be fun to go around our house with the light to see what we would find. We aren't the original owners of the house and it has been passed down a few times. The 1/2 bath that our guests needed to be bombed and re-built, the walls had some interesting splatters on them and our upstairs carpet (which is original to the house) was a bunch of small stains that have melded together to create one huge glowing monster stain. Needless to say, I ran out the next day and doused our house in bleach and we will be replacing the upstairs carpet soon! Beware: purchase this at your own risk knowing that you may want to gut your house! lol!

  Purchased December 2017 for $8.95 with free shipping.This 51-LED Flashlight is Fantastic! I purchased a smaller 9 LED ""UV"" light about a year ago and it was junk, lots of LEDs are much, much better.From what I can tell every tiny little protein-based speck — protein-based as in pretty much anything that comes out of a living breathing creature — glows like a big bright neon sign.Lovely.This flashlight should come with a warning advising us that we ""may"" need to stock up on cleaning supplies and have a few extra hours set aside for addressing the interesting little things which we ""may"" find the first time we use it. What has been seen cannot be unseen — in my own ""clean"" house I was amazed and appalled to find far too many little invisible-to-the-naked-eye specks, splatters, and streaks. Ugh.The flashlight takes 3 standard AA batteries. They were easy to install.The on/off button is located on the side where it is comfortably within thumb reach.If you have teenagers, plan accordingly. Privileges are earned.I did not in any manner receive any compensation whatsoever for this review. Unfortunately.

  I loaded this up with batteries as soon as I got it and in daylight (inside of course) took it out to where I know that one of the 3 cats in the house had wet before. I had no idea what the horror that I was about to discover.As I swept the bluish-purple beam across the carpet and along the baseboards, what was reflected back to me in brilliant white was a story of struggle, of frustration, a fight for dominance and standing, a battlefield of stains and sprayings. The 3 little kitties act nice and purr and softly meow with one another when we're around, but buried deep within each of their dark, furry little hearts must lurk a dark force that compels them to out spray each other. Either that or they are all colluding against me; peeing on the walls and carpet when I'm not looking, even though they go out 5x a day and have 2 litterboxes in the house.The good news is that this flashlight is a secret weapon for humans to fight back. I've started stalking the halls and their favorite marking spots with my water gun which I use to generously douse any cat who so much as hesitates in his or her passage through the hallway. I bought some enzymatic cleaner that breaks down the urine stains and erases all trace of their work.My sudden advantage of knowing exactly where everything was happening, coupled with the super soaker, it has completely thrown the cats into a state of confusion. They don't know HOW I know, but they know that I know, and they no longer pee anywhere that I can find. I'm in charge now!This flashlight truly tips the odds in your favor!

  Ever smoke a prime rib? Need to truss a big ole turkey? I watch too much food network and like to smoke meats. This is what you need to properly truss and wrangle your meat into a presentable package. You also have enough twine left over to make crafts, tie up children or your significant other. Great price, great product, all natural. Buy it.

  I loved crocheting bags with this twine! It's super sturdy and great for market totes (also easy to wash since it's cotton). It is quite heavy though since it is 16-ply but I don't mind the weight as long as it's sturdy.

  For those considering purchasing this as a replacement for the OXO Good Grips Twine Dispenser, it fits perfectly. The threading seems to be on par with the quality of the oxo as well.

  Used this product to secure a bacon weave to a pork loin.  Very large roll of cooking string for a low price, easy to open and cut to desired lengths.  I was worried the string would pull the bacon off on removal, but you can see from the pictures it came off very easily.  I did let the lion rest about 10 mins before removing.  Highly recommend for the price and amount you receive, plus the effectiveness is great!

  I grew up in a generation where we always had a ball of twine in the house. Whether it was there to help pull out a tooth, tie turkey legs together or bind a package together for mailing, the twine was always at hand. It is so nice to have that again. You'd be amazed at how many times it comes in handy. Better than Scotch tape!!!

  This is the perfect twine for trussing large pieces of meat for rotisserie grilling, especially chickens.  And why do we truss chickens?  Because we don't truss lawyers.
