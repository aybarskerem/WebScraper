0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"2020 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Chip (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) - Space Gray",NA,5,"
  I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.

  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.

  I bought my Mac from Apple directly not from Amazon. This thing is amazing. Battery life is awesome. Hard to believe that I can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen.No issues with speed at all. I use Matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with 12 core AMD CPU and 32 GB ram.Excellent machine. Happy I bought it.

  I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

  Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However, I would say something different.For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip, I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it's useless).Secondly, would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface, the MacBook turns off itself. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.Also, I miss the MagSafe...

  I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

  Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon

  I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.

  UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.

  The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.

  Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.

  Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.

  No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.

  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!

  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.

  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?

  After passing off last year's model to my brother (3500U Flex 14), I got this as soon as I saw it posted up on Reddit. I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since.Let's get the rundown here.- Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU- Radeon Vega 6 graphics- 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop)- 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD- 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!)Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but it opens up almost all the way with one hand (tilts towards the end). The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more ""premium."" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2.I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W).The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a ""worst case"" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all!Camera is acceptable. Nothing to write home about, but it'll work well enough for video calls. Battery is excellent - while browsing the web and watching videos, I have been consistently draining 10% per hour of use! That 10 hour claim from Lenovo seems pretty spot on.Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier:- 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7- Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (4700U option is now available in some places)- Metal constructionI'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing.

  ***UPDATE 3 - 12/2/20 - Have had several issues recently and wanted to pass along how I resolved them.  Issue #1 was trying to boot up the computer after 12 hours of sleep and being unable to get the computer to turn on at all.  Didn't matter if it was plugged in or not.  The battery was fully charged.  I tried holding the power button.  No go, laptop was dead.  As a final attempt before sending it in for service, I pulled off the bottom cover of the laptop and disconnected the battery cable for several minutes.  I plugged it back in, pressed the power button,and the laptop booted normally.  Everything worked fine after that and I haven't had the issue since.  Issue #2 was noticing the laptop was no longer charging when connected to the USB-C charger.  Even the charging LED wouldn't come on.  The fix was to shut down the computer completely, then hold the power button for 20-40 seconds.  The charge light came on and the laptop started charging again.**UPDATE 2 - 7/2/20 - Resolved an audio stuttering issue by turning off Dolby Audio processing in the Dolby app.***UPDATE - 6/10/20 - Dropping a star.  Sent original back due to crashing issues when waking from sleep.  Wifi also dropped occasionally and had trouble reconnecting after sleep.  New unit seems to work fine.  Also replaced wireless card with Intel AX200 (need torx T5 bit to remove bottom panel).  Much faster and no dropped connections.  Still really like the laptop (and Amazon's return policy).*Original Review:Overall usability – Everything about the laptop feels well-built and like it should cost hundreds more.  Incredibly fast processor, especially given the 15W TDP.  The AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors (7nm Zen 2) have really improved the thermals and efficiency to the same level as Intel (or better).  Between the 6 core processor and the  PCIe NVMe SSD the laptop flies.  Nothing I’ve thrown at it has been able to slow it down or make it stutter.  Benchmarks comparable to my HP desktop with i7-7700 (if in best performance mode while plugged in).  Applications open instantly in most cases.  Comes out of short-term sleep instantly.  Nice webcam privacy cover.  Fingerprint reader is best I’ve used in terms of accuracy and speed.  Fans are quiet under normal loads and a low non-annoying whirring when the GPU/CPU is taxed.Exterior – Very light weight (but not cheap feeling) and nice sturdy build.  Feels like it will hold up well.  Keyboard back-light adjustable.  Plenty of ports.  Hinges also feel built to last.Touchscreen – Sensitive and good feel (though I prefer matte to glossy).  Works well with included pen.Bloatware – Almost none (uninstalled Skype).Speakers – Above average for price range.  Not especially tinny sounding like cheaper laptops.  Don’t expect bass though.  The included Dolby equalizer software can help improve the sound if you don’t mind experimenting.  Side-mounted front-facing speakers are well placed.Screen – Brightness OK for indoor use, but I plan to run it at 90% brightness even on battery because anything less is too dim.  Colors are bright.  No noticeable back light bleed.Battery life – Above average for price range.  Really quite impressive.  Could easily last half to three-quarters of the stated 10 hours depending on the conditions (clearly not doing anything processor or graphics intensive for the duration, but web browsing, office work, or video viewing).Wireless/Bluetooth – Some occasional random disconnects and trouble connecting after sleep, likely due to Realtek wireless card.  Average speeds on my 5GHz home network.Keyboard/Trackpad – High quality feel.  You can tell when you’ve hit a key unlike cheaper laptops.  Miss the numpad, but knew it didn’t have one before I ordered.  Trackpad not over-sensitive or unresponsive.  Good balance, but still prefer a mouse.Graphics/Gaming – Played Two-Point Hospital on Steam at 1080p very high graphics setting.  Not very graphics intensive or an FPS, but the game is newer and frame-rate didn’t drop below 30 in game.  Game load times are ridiculously fast.Downsides – Mediocre webcam.  Soldered RAM (not a big deal w/16 GB, but if it goes bad it is a big problem).  Screen may not be bright enough for outdoor use and the glossy coating leads to reflections/glare when viewing from an angle.  Wireless card not great.  Stories of poor tech support (though, admittedly I’ve never interacted with them).**Don’t forget to create your USB backup drive from the Lenovo website for crashes/re-installs.  Or have the Windows 10 ISO handy on a USB drive and download the drivers/apps from the website.

   For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the ""Lenovo Representative"" knows nothing about their product. Yes, it has dual channel 16GB RAM @ 3200mhz, it ships with the Lenovo pencil included. Screen is only @ 250 nits, but I wouldn't call it a deal breaker unless you plan to use it outdoors a lot. Plastic machine but nothing feels cheap. The hinge is a little loose to my taste, the touchpad is a little shaky. Other than those, everything fits my needs. Very satisfying first day of use.Update: the audio starts to cutoff randomly from the 2nd day, all drivers and windows updates and BIOS are up to date. I contacted both Amazon and Lenovo tech support, after a remote session, the problem persists. Then I noticed the trackpad is shaky and sticky ( see video).So overall it's a nice product, but quality control can be a problem.

  The 1 star is for the poor quality control by Acer.I received the laptop and immediately started to set it up. Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer’s quality control.I can’t really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start. I’m hoping that is the only issue with the machine as most reviews I’ve read about the Nitro 5 are positive.Update: It has been 22 days since I received the brand new laptop from Amazon. Acer repair has had the laptop for 14 days now and I still have not received any info about the status of my case other than it is still being repaired.  I am not happy about having to wait 3+ weeks to have a brand new working laptop.

  Parents bought this for my sister and this is perfect for her to start on it's good for light-medium gaming. With school converting to online it's perfect as well. This computer also has good battery life away from the charger while might use with heavy use not so much it's good though. Overall the computer is good for it's current price and an amazing deal.

  I included potential solutions to the problems I had in the cons section.Pros:-slim size, easy to take on the go-cheap-open slots inside to upgrade componentsCons (that I found solutions to):-loud fans, combined with poor audio quality. The built in speaker volume needs to be turned up pretty high to hear over the fan noise. The fan noise also means you should leave your mic on push to talk rather than open during online games, otherwise your poor teammates will have to listen to it constantly. Good news is there is blue tooth, so I suggest connecting external speakers or headphones instead.-hot CPU. Make sure your battery settings are on ""better performance"" rather than ""best performance"", regardless of if it's plugged in or not. Otherwise, the CPU hits 90 C. Better to have less performance or learn to undervolt if you want the laptop to last very long.-wrong GPU used during gaming. If you have really bad performance, it could be that the laptop is using the Intel GPU rather than the GTX 1650. Go into NVIDIA Control Panel, and under ""manage 3D settings"" and ""global settings"", switch preferred graphics processor to ""high-performance NVIDIA processor"" rather than auto.-laptop suddenly restarts within seconds of booting up, when not plugged into power. For me, going into startup apps and turning off ""Delayed Launcher"" fixed this.-not enough space, and plenty of bloatware to make it worse. Definitely invest in at least 1TB of additional storage. 256 GB is only enough space for two or three games, unless you only play games from the 90's.Cons (without solutions I could find):-yellowish smudges at the top of the screen, only visible though when the screen is black-the touch pad is terrible. It's on the left for some reason, so both your hands have to be crammed left to use them during games. Not an issue if you use controllers or a mouse. Also, the mouse is very delayed and floats around. Tried updating drivers but nothing works, it's super laggy most of the time!-keyboard lights only turn on when a key is pressed and automatically turn off after 30 seconds. There is no way to leave them on, which sucks when you're using it in the dark. There are forums complaining about this, and the company refuses to add the feature to leave them on even though many people are requesting the option.-short battery life. This doesn't bother me because I view gaming laptops more like transportable desktops, but keep in mind that this will not last you very long if you want to play on the bus or plane.

  The best laptop a 10 year old “gamer girl” could ask for! I’m blown away at how nice this laptop is, especially for the price.NOTE : External hard drive will need to be purchased separately though if you’re wanting to run more than two games on it, simply because it doesn’t have a large enough internal drive to run more than that.

  I want to point out ive only had it a week and will update if anything changes about my review. Overall, before I get into details, I am very satisfied with this laptop and it’s performance.The pricing as what I bought was 1418.99$ for the intel i7-10750H with the rtx 3060 and 500G m.2. The availability of laptops has been pretty bad and I feel I wasn’t overcharged for the current market.Pros:Rtx 3060 is a little better than imagined. It is the 80W variant but will turbo up to 100W with spikes over 115W very well.The turbo button above the keyboard is actually more useful than I would have expected. In cyberpunk at max settings with medium ray tracing it’s an easily playable 55 FPS and turbo activated averages around 5fps or more higher even in the worst areas.Temperatures at first freaked me out cause I saw spikes over 90C. But I found it was only temporary and the average with a decent fan curve was around 69 to 75C on both cpu and gpu.Predator sense software built in is useful. But I still downloaded MSI afterburner for in game over lay though.Cons:Fans get pretty loud when you activate turbo. So if you got a decent headset and nobody around you it won’t bother you. But if your around people they will think you have a jet engine running. But even without turbo mode you get more than playable frame-rates in every game I’ve played. Most newer titles like cyberpunk and ValhallaBattery is whatever. It’s maybe an hr usage if you’re playing heavy games and 7 hrs if you keep power saver mode on and only use it for light work like google chrome or YouTube.Other aspects:Screen was nothing special. Not super bright but not excessively dark or glare issues. Keyboard is fine. Again, nothing special. It’s a laptop. Bloatware wasn’t too bad. Just uninstalled it all. But overall it is a quick responsive little laptop for easy gaming and even can do some work. I’m very satisfied because I’m a trucker on the road everyday and needed something a little more portable but still had performance to play the newer games without going to a 2 grand or more computer. I would recommend it to others.Edit: I forgot to say the pictures are without turbo and with turbo on 3D mark timespy score.

  ***EDIT*** ***The Pictures of the Laptop open are a before and after, It does have a WD SN730 Nvme M.2 Pci-e SSD but I also added a 250GB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe V-Nand M.2 Pci-e SSD I had laying around to the build and it's very very simple to take off and upgrade, just a few screws and pull from the back where the exhaust fans are located and it also has an extra Nvme Screw as well*** I build PCs on the side and have for years this laptop CAN DO IT ALL, it has a great CPU the Core i7-10750H with 6 cores and 12 threads which is plenty for modern gaming and 12Mb of Intel level 3 smart cache and it's paired with the BEASTLY NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6 laptop gpu, which is Overclockable with the touch of a button and has 3840 Cuda Cores and 30 2nd generation Ray Tracing cores also its running 336Gb/Sec on a 192 bit memory bus interface which runs at 14Gb/s and sits around 11 Teraflops of graphical power from a LAPTOP, think about that! I have pushed this thing to its limits Days Gone PC version that's just released on the 18th I can play MAXED OUT setting on everything and it never dipped below 90fps and my average was around 124-127fps, this thing is just as powerful as my RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Trio gpu in my one desktop, I own an RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 3080 but they're all Desktop Gpu's but it definitely gives the 2070 Super Desktop GPU some good competition without a doubt. And it's Ampere 8nm architecture so newest Nvidia technology compared to 12nm Turing architecture, and the screen is absolutely gorgeous playing day or night with a true IPS display running at 144Hz @ 3ms, if you want a SOLID GOOD LAPTOP FOR GAMING, this is it, the ACER Predator Helios 300 can't be beat and I own Asus/Origin/Dell etc etc laptops as well and nothing ever Beats my ACER LAPTOPS, and this beauty is made of a nice metal and sturdy plastic on certain parts but mostly metal and u can see the quality ACER put into this laptop, and yes the PREDATOR symbol on the screen lights up and its perfect for letting others know you mean business lol I recommend 100% for the bang for your buck! That's it that's all I got for ya

  I had it a week ago and tested lots of thing. I am quite satisfied with its design, build quality, and, of course, performance.I bought it for 1250$ on 14th April. It came with i7-10750h, rtx 3060, and 500G m.2. I bought it with discount and I think it is frequently on discount.Thermal impressed me the most for the laptop. When turbo mode is not activated, fans are not that loud and GPU temperature is around 70 degree and CPU temperature is around 78 degree in heavy games in performance mode. If you activate turbo mode temperatures decrease to 60 degree. Turbo mode also increase FPS a bit, but GPU power does not increase more than 90W. You can play every game easily with this laptop at high FPS for sure.Only bad thing is fans get really loud in turbo mode. If you have a decent headphone, so no problem. However, the sound is more like plane engine.Battery is not bad. It goes 1hr for gaming, but for light work it can go approximately 6hr. Screen is also good, it is 144hz and 15.6"" at 1080p. It is also matte and gorgeous, but fingerprint magnet. Overall laptop is fingerprint magnet.  Keyboard is also reassuring and used plastic and aluminum for all laptop are good-looking and solid.

  Honestly the system is exactly what I want. Simple gaming system I can travel with, the graphics card is better than other systems at the price, and I was able to use the internal M2 spot to install a 1TB drive. all in all Star Citizen, Doom, World of Warcraft and multiple other games are running great faster than my gaming desktop.Only downside is it is only 1080p but for the price & it is easy to overlook. and don't touch the screen it isn't touch screen.

  If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.The good.- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4"" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the ""happy medium"" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.""4 (now 16"") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.The Bad- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.If you're upgrading from the 13"" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.

  The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ...Yet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity.Now that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ?Apple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that.Lastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ....

  Edit: The prices change quite a bit, and Amazon doesn't do price-matching, so keep an eye out for that. There's a website that shows the lowest price for each configuration, so check that out first before buying. I ended up returning my i7 MBP to get the i9 because 512GB of space just isn't that much, and definitely wasn't enough for my purposes. Both are excellent machines and I'm waiting to see how hot the i9 gets under sustained load.I used to have a lot of apple products, with my last macbook being the 2012 13 and 15"" macbook pros. I ended up giving those to friends as I transitioned to a new windows-based laptop for college.7 years later, and I finally had a compelling reason to purchase the newest MBP: a normal keyboard, USB C, larger screen, and improved thermals. My main gripe with thin and light laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th gen) has been that their thermals are awful. My hands would burn up while typing, even after a good repaste and undervolt. It also didn't help that their screens were on the smaller side.I've had the new MBP for a few days now. I bought the base model i7, and while I'm enjoying it, I do wish I sprung for the i9 at the very least due to the 1TB of storage. I have handfuls of external storage, but it really gets annoying to have to go through different drives when storage fills up. I do use more storage than a typical user IMO, as I typically have Bootcamp installed along with different CAD programs, IDEs, datasets, etc. However, I'm sure the extra storage would be nice for anyone.So far, the transition has been great! My only issue so far has been the battery life - 10 to 11 hours is definitely a stretch, and I personally found myself running out of battery after 4-5 hours of heavy multi-tasking, fans at a constant 60% (basically inaudible in a packed starbucks), at full brightness, with a lot of external power-hungry peripherals. Honestly, that's not that bad!

  I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal.  It is  like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core.  Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy.  I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance).  The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year).  After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch.  The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage.  I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2.  I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen.  That would made it perfect for my needs.  It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.Overall, I would buy it again.[UPDATE 2-3-2021]I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm.  The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively.  I just added a screenshot.I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.EDIT:I replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S).  This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me.  Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues.  Really happy with it.  I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.

  For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get.This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great.If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable ""S mode"", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google ""disable S mode"" and you'll find the steps easy enough.64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks. The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. 😂ASUS is one of the best quality computer parts manufacturers around, so this also should last a good while. Overall, I definitely recommend this for your more basic computer needs.

  I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.PROS --Incredible Price to Performance RatioVery well built, with no cheap partsFull-size, comfortable keyboardSmall and lightweightGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatwareInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slotI could keep going... it's $200.CONS --No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)Some irksome viewing angle problemsMaddeningly little built in storageAlmost too little RAMI've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):Introduction (above)Weight & BuildKeyboard and TrackpadScreenBatteryPerformance (including Gaming)WebcamSpeakers & SoundSoftwareOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)ConclusionLinks to AccessoriesLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.With that being said, let me get into the details.WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.UPDATE: There's seems to be an issue with the screen calibration. Frequently, it will turn noticeably yellow, and by right clicking on the desktop and clicking 'display settings,' it seems to at least temporarily fix it. I believe very much this is a software issue, so it's unlikely you'll encounter it, but it would be interesting to know if others are encountering the same problem.BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.SPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.LINK TO ACCESSORIES - Some may find this helpful. These are subject to change - Amazon is always adding or removing their product offerings, so if one's not available, these should at least give you an idea of what to look for. But at the time of this writing, these are the accessories I purchased for it, and that all work.SD Card (256gb, $40) - Lots of storage to hold a small collection of movies, music, or pictures. Plenty fast enough.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCR3316/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Laptop Case ($12) - The laptop fits perfectly.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VVLE5CG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Microfiber Clothes ($8) - You can never have too many of these.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050R67U0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_
sin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1Wireless Mouse ($16) - Oddly, the little LEDS in it aren't nearly as bright as advertised, but it's a great mouse. Good click, the scroll wheel is nice. And it has an option between Bluetooth or dongle. Charges off of USB, so no batteries needed.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085HR8VPM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1Messenger Bag ($32) - Fits the Laptop [in the case] like a glove. It's a little large, but it's stylish and has lots of pockets.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072PVTHR9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

  I haven't seen many reviews for this particular CPU/model. I have been using this laptop to work from home for about a week now, which means I keep it plugged in on my desk and on for 8+ hours a day while I work with spreadsheets and email clients. Numerous reviews for the i5-10210 CPU mentioned the terrible fan noise and low sound quality, but I haven't experienced either of those issues with i5-1035G1. The fan does turn on sometimes when I'm not heavily using the laptop, but it doesn't stay on long and it's not very loud. I play workout videos on the laptop and am very pleased with sound and video quality. For reference, I had an i3 Asus laptop for nine years before getting this one, so my standards are kind of low because my old one was so much heavier, clunkier, slower, etc. Nevertheless, this seems fantastic for what I need it to do, which is mainly to facilitate my work-from-home experience. Since it has only been a week my experience is limited, so if anything goes catastrophically wrong I will update my review. Fingers crossed...**EDIT**November 18, 2020: Still a great laptop. No issues!

  This is my third Acer laptop (other 2 are still functional) and after 2 weeks this has been a solid performer.  Performs well and with WiFi 6 I am getting superb speed using 5 GHz network.  Battery life has been good so far.  I will say that compared to my Aspire E laptop the keyboard is slimmer, and the number pad keys and functions keys are smaller but there is nice tactile feedback on the keys and the back lighting is nice.What has been difficult is getting proper information about configuration.  Like some other reviews, my laptop came with 1 8 GB memory stick rather than a 4 + 4 configuration.  So this laptop maxes out at only 16 GB of RAM, and you are limited to using only Kingston memory (per Acer and my own testing).  So that was a bit of a bummer.I was able to add a second SDD (I used WD Blue b/c of price) which is always a nice feature of the Acer laptops.  This was more difficult than my Aspire E laptops but still doable.  The trick is to remove the screw holding the Intel chip down so you can fully seat the connector.

  I needed a new laptop for my work from home setup, and this offered speed, Wi-Fi 6, fingerprint reader and a backlit keyboard for a good price. The system is upgradeable - I upgraded the M.2 SSD from the standard 256 GB to 1 TB for the operating system and applications, and I added a 1 TB SATA SSD for my data, since there is a expansion space for this additional drive, and the system provides an installation bracket and ribbon cable for that purpose.My only disappointment is that the specifications indicate that the system will support a maximum of 20 GB of RAM, and states that there is 4 GB on onboard RAM, with the rest of the RAM installed in an expansion slot that is accessible for upgrading. My system came with 8 GB of RAM, but all of it was in the module in the expansion slot, and so when I replaced it with a 16 GB module, that is the maximum amount of memory I can use with the system. It's still a great system, and 16 GB is more than adequate for my purposes. It's just that the published specifications lead you to believe you can host more RAM than the system is capable of hosting.

  Then Acer made me spend $50 to send it to them for replacement. Moral of the story - if you're gonna buy an Acer on Amazon, pay the extra money for the protection plan, or buy a better laptop than this one. I have zero expectations for this thing going forward.

  Really nice laptop. I needed a new laptop and compared to my 2 year old Dell this is so much nicer. Very smooth and fast performance. Feels and looks nice. Set up was pretty easy even for me which I’m not a computer geek or anything. So far I really like it and expect it to last a long time. Excellent build quality. I only wish it had a built in dvd/cd drive. They are getting hard to find in  laptops in this price range though. Highly recommend if you want a nice laptop at a decent price

  My old computer uses Windows 7 which (as we all know) is no longer supported. I've been looking for a new computer with Windows 10 and I liked the Acer Aspire 5 specs.A backlit keyboard is a dealbreaker for me and it has a nice one. I wish I could disable the time-out feature; it goes dark very quickly (which is annoying) but I only have to hit a key/spacebar to light it up again. Also, I cannot adjust the brightness of the backlit keyboard. I would prefer to be able to have the keyboard stay lit and to adjust the brightness (as with my older laptop) but those are not options here. I do like the feel of the keyboard and the fact that it has a numbers pad.The screen size is great. I like the image quality.Finding things on Windows 10 is not difficult and I've spent a lot of time today setting things up how I want them. I just noticed the default setting for the camera is ""Allow apps to access your camera"", which I turned off.The internal speakers have a nice sound. I have music playing now and I do not feel a need to plug in my external speakers to amplify it.Cannot address battery life yet as I am always near a power source so I just keep laptops plugged in.I buy devices to use for a long time (my last laptop is going on 8 years) and I plan on using this one for quite a while. For my personal use it should be more than adequate.

  I wasn't fully sure what to expect, I've never had a chromebook but really needed something that I could take with me on the go to work on my shop updates, work stuff, and school when that starts up. It's taking some getting used to but I'm loving it so far! Battery life is as expected, I left it on overnight and I still had a full battery the next morning. Touchscreen is responsive. Shipping was STUPID FAST, ordered it Saturday night and received it Monday out here butt-shuck nowhere, Wyoming. So, ya know, impressive. Definitely like a tablet with a keyboard, but it's so much better than any tablet I've used. I have a fire kindle (same thing as a tablet imo. One of those gifts you get and you're like ""ohhhhhhhh, thaaaaankkkkksssss....I'ma never use this. But thank you."" Obviously you never tell them that because that would be rude, so instead it sits in the bookcase with your hard copies collecting dust because you don't want to get rid of it and have them find out.) and -anyway- this thing blows it out of the park. Feels lightweight but sturdy at the same time, it's no little biiiish, it feels like it can hold it's own.

  I'm 72 and have been agonizing replacing my aging Asus laptop. Back and forth between a Chromebook or a laptop. Read reviews on the differences, threw a dart, and ordered this Chromebook. What a great decision. Opened it up, plugged it in and turned it on. Then answered a few questions and it synched with my Note8. I like to cook and can hardly wait to look up a recipe, tent it, and start creating.  I have very simple computer needs, email, banking, and, looking up recipes. For me this is a 5.

  Much faster and of course newer than my old Acer 15"" Chromebook, which was one of the first 15"" models they made and the only 15"" Chromebook on the market when I bought it. I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn't support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name.I'll start off by saying this thing feels really sturdy, built well in typical Acer fashion. But I'm kind of surprised with how big the bezels are, they easily could've put a bigger screen in the thing. The screen that is installed though is plenty bright enough for my use, and is perfectly sharp at a typical viewing distance with good viewing angles. The touchscreen is kind of flaky in my experience, but that could be a problem with the user since some touchscreens just don't like responding well to my fingers. Performance in typical use is perfectly fine, but don't expect to do much gaming as it doesn't have the power to run more intense Android games smoothly. WiFi is very fast and signal is excellent. The ports provided are great, and I love that it can be charged from either USB-C port. The keyboard feels pretty good and the trackpad is about what you'd expect on a device like this.Now where I am truly disappointed is in the fact that stylus support was removed from the last model of this system. I'm a bit of an artist and like to draw on occasion, even if it's just playing a round of Draw Something to fix my itch. I thought drawing on this with an Android app would be pretty nice compared to my Note phone. And another person had already asked if this system supported an active stylus, which Acer responded by saying yes. This thing absolutely does NOT support an active stylus. At least not an EMR one like you find in Samsung devices (S-Pen) or a Wacom stylus. I'm tempted to send this model back and order the older one since there doesn't seem to be much difference between the N3350 and N4020 CPUs.I'll also mention here that the indent for the second camera that goes above the keyboard for use in tablet mode is present, but there isn't a camera. I was unsure what this indent was for until I did some more reading online and found a review for a pre-release version of this system. That included the camera and stylus. Seems they changed their minds on both features but didn't bother to get rid of the indent.Long story short, it's a good little 2-in-1 but some design choices are odd for a device in 2020. Also many of the reviews out there are for the last model (N3350 CPU) or for pre-production test units that have features this thing actually doesn't have (stylus and second camera). Also look at the true reviews closely as this thing is offered with the Intel CPU (N4020), and AMD CPU, and a MediaTek CPU.

  Got this for elementary school children. I've never owned a chromebook so didn't know what to expect, but so far it has impressed me.  Easy to setup with a google account.  Also like how you can apply parental controls using google family.  As far as the device itself-- love the touchscreen.  My kids don't really use the flipped mode but i like that it is an option.  Very happy with my purchase.  Also, I didn't buy the extended protection but am now thinking I will.

  This is probably the best $400 Chromebook on the market right now.  Unfortunately, I had to return mine.  The display is a nice full HD 1920 x 1080 with bright crisp color.  The keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is large and responsive.  Browsing the web is very quick.  I benchmarked this machine with Octane 2 and got a score of around 12000.  Not bad for a Celeron.  So... why did I send it back.  The problem was that the Chromebook I received had two manufacturing flaws.  The case is aluminum which is great, but the bottom edge of my case had a sharp edge going all way around.  I think the aluminum case was a fraction of a millimeter too wide.  It wasn't sharp enough to cut, but it gave the Chromebook an unfinished feel.  The second problem was that the trackpad was loose.  It worked fine, but when you tapped (which you do a lot on Chromebooks), the trackpad rattled slightly.  I thought I could live with it, but the more I used it, the more crazy it made me.  Hopefully, these build problems were only on the Chromebook that I received and all the other Acer 514s do not have these issues.

  bought at $249.00 Respectable specs for price given current demand. Getting 8+ hours of battery life surfing web and watching YouTube. If you cant tell from pics. micro SD slot reader for media and volume rocker on side. your play store app compatibly will vary. please note that only about 20 GB of that storage is available for apps. if you are new to Chromebooks (or computers in general) this is more of a tablet+ than a full laptop replacement

  Taking a look at the specs of this laptop, you would expect it to be incredible, especially for this price point. Taking a look at the online reviews shows that the screen isn't the best, and it takes a few more hits, but even so it looks like an amazing deal. After using it, in my opinion it's worth the money, but not as fantastic as it appears.TLDR: Look at what you want in a laptop before buying this one. For me it works fine but there are a few key drawbacks that might affect different tasks you would want to use this laptop for.The PRO's+ Build Quality is fantastic, with sturdy metal and a keyboard I surprisingly quite enjoy using.+ Big PRO: The Ryzen 4700U processor is a beast, and the snappiest processor I've used. Productivity use such as coding, taking notes in class, running other professional programs like the Microsoft suite or Zoom are handled easily and perfectly.+ Big PRO: A 512GB SSD for this price is incredible! And it's even a really good SSD at that.The CON's- The screen is as bad as they say, even after calibration. It's only slightly better than my old laptop I bought for $350 a few years ago. However, as someone who doesn't use the laptop for video editing, it's not a big issue for me, but everything does look more green/blue than it should.- I've had software problems with this laptop that I would not have expected from a pre-built laptop, especially from a company like Acer. I have problems with apps being fuzzy (not scaling to the display properly), problems with Cortana and the Windows Start menu, and problems with the screen not immediately waking from sleep. These problems are rare and/or not too impactful, but still annoying.- The BIGGEST CON by far is the thermals. The laptop has amazing specs as I mentioned above, but it can't use them to their full potential because the components get too hot and have to cut back on speed. The fans are noisy and run at full speed often. I regularly experience temps of 70°+ while web browsing, and 90°+ while (light) gaming or other more intensive tasks.To me that is a huge letdown, as this laptop does not perform heavy tasks like it should. The processor is limited by the cooling of the laptop and can't really do all that it's has the potential to do.Overall, I am disappointed by the low upper limit of the hardware, but for my needs as a tech-savvy college student looking for a good laptop for classes, it's perfect. It's light and portable, sturdy, fast, and cheap. Even the gaming/heavy use cases are.... acceptable, even if they aren't what they could be. I recommend this laptop to many people, but it's not for everyone.

  I try really hard not to do same-day delivery reviews, no matter how great I think the product is because you can never tell on that first day what might go wrong later. However, I am actually confident and happy enough with this one to go for it. If I make amendments later, they won't likely be anything that changes this rating. (updated 6/19/20 - one week, using it for work in web design and content creation, still love it)I needed a business-appropriate laptop. My requirements for this were pretty simple: something with a sharp but conservative appearance, MOBILE (not heavy or bulky), but also just as powerful (or capable of being just as powerful) as my much larger personal laptop. It came down to this and the Lenovo Flex. I chose this because the design was all metal, and I liked Macbook Airs when working as an Apple systems manager for their durability, style, and mobility. It's just a shame the RAM is not upgradeable (it's soldered). The RAM on the Lenovo Flex is not upgradeable either, though. It also comes with a weaker processor (Ryzen 5, which isn't quite on the i7's level). I doubt anyone will need more than 8 to 16GB of RAM in the lifetimes of these laptops. I knew that if I got a Ryzen 5 that would just make me want the Ryzen 7 processor more (you can never upgrade processors in a laptop). So, despite toting less RAM, Swift still came out as the winner both in design and performance when I compared it up close to the Flex online.I worried a bit when I read a review that complained about the screen and graphics on Swift being almost unusable. But I clearly had nothing to worry about. Those professional reviewers sometimes can get so snobby with hardware, they set the bar higher than anyone in the real world would ever set it.The screen is semi-matte. I have very sensitive eyes, sensitive enough that I often have to wear blue light blocking glasses to deal with sunlight, bright indoor lights, or computer light. Even the slightest flicker is noticeable to me in a very uncomfortable, painful kind of way that strains my eyes. There's the tiniest amount of flicker in this display. It is NOTHING like the reviews have been describing, which made me afraid I wouldn't be able to use this laptop. It's VERY easy on my eyes after switching the AMD Radeon settings to Enhanced and High Res (which simultaneously smoothes and sharpens up the text, making it more legible). It also does NOT have a glossy, highly reflective screen. The screen is semi-matte at the worst (honestly, it's not even that much), and it's full matte once it's turned on. Evidently Acer has switched displays after the complaints (they tend to be good about doing things like that). It gets super bright, and the colors are close to true as far as I can tell - only publishing something is going to reveal the truth there, which I haven't done yet. But again, I can't believe what a close call it is to a Macbook Air.The graphics performance: It's not a gaming laptop, though I'm sure it is good enough to play most games on medium and would be PERFECT for a student. It's definitely strong enough to perform smoothly for graphic artists, photographers, and anyone that tends to keep a ton of tabs open in their browser. Smooth scrolling and rendering, no lag or glitching.I cannot compliment the Ryzen 7 processor enough. I am moving from an 8th gen i7 and the Ryzen 7 is WAY more responsive and less prone to freezing or errors. I can very easily believe it maxes out at 4ghz. Those eight cores handle multitasking like a true champ.I was worried the RAM would give me some issues with work because it's only 8gb and it's also underpowered to help boost battery performance. So far, I've been surprised to find that this low-powered RAM actually keeps up with me despite my issues with never exiting or closing windows, lol.The keyboard is extremely comfortable if you have small to medium-sized hands. There is some time to adjust to the smaller form factor. Large handed people will immediately hate the keyboard because it's compact. This being said, it IS a large keyboard as far as COMPACT keyboards go, and it is 100% identical to the keyboard on the Macbook Air. Same feel and everything. Backlit keys, which you can switch on or off. Something SUPER cool is that Acer figured out how to include a Numlock and number keypad on it by marking some of the letter keys with numbers, then adding a Numlock. (check my pictures)If you turn on the manual equalizer in the audio settings and crank it up, the speakers actually get really loud, and they're nice that way too (no rattle, no stress on the drivers). By default though, I can easily see tons of folks complaining about the speakers not getting loud. They don't get loud at all by default. With the equalizer maxed out, I would compare them to a mini Bluetooth speaker.In short, don't buy this for audio unless you're planning on connecting it to different speakers. For normal casual usage, like watching YouTube videos or streaming movies, the built-in speakers should be just fine.The lid is very well hinged. The screen is reinforced as well. Dropping it may cause some cosmetic damage, but it should hold up in most cases. At the worst, you'll be looking at a little cosmetic damage (scratches, dings) and a busted screen. Which is better than what you could face with the typical plastic body. I once dropped a plastic body laptop off the back of my car (I was an idiot and left it on the hood). It totally destroyed the body... the laptop still worked, but there was bare PCB board everywhere. It was ugly, lol.Now, there are complaints about battery life on this, but I haven't had any problems. I also didn't go with default settings in some key areas, though. I changed the Radeon settings to focus more on battery life than performance. Then I changed the power settings to best battery life. Now, I don't consider this to be much, especially with my huge collection of background apps, but considering complaints saying the battery wouldn't last more than an hour... hmmm. I'm not seeing it. I've been on battery for an hour now, and have 12h 46m remaining after charging to 98%. I'm guessing the expected battery life will hang somewhere between 4.5h and 6h on medium.Overall, it's a great machine and an awesome value in my book. I have no idea why the pro reviewers thought so poorly of it (though they did give it respect as a budget laptop). Maybe they were comparing it to more expensive laptops instead of comparing it to other models in this price range....? Or maybe the older version of this was really that bad.Whatever. I'm sticking with this because IT WORKS.Update: Two months later... it's still running like the day I got it. I'm actually shocked that it continues to perform so well on 8GB of energy saving RAM. I am guessing the difference lies in a combo of using a better processor and using a solid state drive. My other laptop has an A12, which is quad core and goes up to 3ghz - this Ryzen 7 is octacore and goes up to 4ghz.The Care Center app has a function in it to make the battery only change to 80% when it's plugged in (saves the battery cells from being burned out). So despite using it plugged in all the time, I have not lost any battery health. It still goes for six hours or more off battery.

  Just received the laptop today. It is amazing. The display is awesome. The laptop is very light (~2.6lb) and it is well constructed overall.  The keyboard is great with a few quirks e.g. a somewhat strong back-light. The performance is awesome, and it is relatively quiet.  I have seen laptops with poorer performance that are ~2X in cost. Kudos to AMD and Acer for bringing an excellent product at the right price point to market.

  First and foremost, this thing is tiny, I'm pretty sure most phones are bigger than this. The keyboard is completely unusable, irredeemably awful would be too kind. The battery life is unimpressive, and the processing ""power"" that so many ostensibly professional reviewers were blown away by has been noticeably absent. Often opening a simple menu will cause the cursor icon to visibly stutter. And the heat that this thing produces, even on stand-by, leads me to believe it will be a very short lived piece of hardware.Worst of all, and most inexcusable, using anything other than the bloated installation of Windows 10 it comes with is made essentially impossible by the complete and total lack of driver support. Simple things like the touchpad won't work, and Acer couldn't be bothered to make those drivers available. I didn't buy this out the back of a van in a Safeway parking lot, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a modicum of basic support. Maybe if they spent a little less money on photoshoots of supermodels looking inquisitively into the distance they could afford to host a few hundred megabytes worth of files. Acer is pathetic.

   I was angry of seeing this kind of fake like screen. Description says it is 178view angle. 178 is ips screen. This one has 20degree view angle i saw in 1997. Maybe it is a fake laptop or screen replaced. This screen extinct in 21st century. You cannot figure out what color is it that that you are seeing on the screen. NOT AT ALL. Screen brightness change even if you move slightly. No matter what distance between 5” ~3ft. It is that bad.  NO matter how you see, top and bottom of the screen have different color and brightness.

  Really like this purchase. Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.

  The worst brand new laptop computer I have ever purchased. Screen quality is so so. Can’t run simple games without lagging out.. audio isn’t even relevant. Can’t hear it at all on 100% volume.

  Ok. Lets talk. No fluff, no fake optimism. Out of all the things I have ever bought on amazon, this purchase was honestly the best. First of all, this laptop exceeded all expectations I had. Like for example, when I saw the laptop for the first time, the screen was sooo much bigger than I anticipated! I love the feeling of the keys. Also, I'm sure you've notice there are a lot of reviews complaining about the screen quality. Ok. Here's the tea sis; the screen is awesome. I'm not seeing anything wrong with it. Those people must be computer experts but for me, there is nothing wrong with it. Also, a big criteria for me was that I could do some gaming. Dude. Literally this laptop is awesome for gaming. It has taken everything that I've downloaded so far and is still purring like a kitten. Overall, this is a super good laptop. I totally think you should get it.

  Let's start with the hardware itself. I was worried the screen would be as terrible as some of these reviews indicate. In my opinion, the screen is just fine. It's probably not great in very bright sunlight, or for video or photo editing purposes. Otherwise, if you just want to do indoor office work, or browse the web, it's totally sufficient and not a reason to pass up this laptop. If you are already used to higher quality displays or have demanding display needs, stop being cheap and look to spend a bit more money.I like the feel and look of the keyboard but I don't like the layout so much. It's novel to include the keypad on a laptop of this size, but it's too close to the other keys. The result is that sometimes you hit the number pad instead of enter, or backspace. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker, and if you type a lot like I do, you'll probably find that you can develop a type of muscle/spacial-familiarity to where it becomes an infrequent issue very quickly.I bought this laptop to install linux on. It required a bit of wrangling with the BIOS to make that possible. Firstly, secure boot and some other settings need to be disabled in the BIOS. Next problem was, this machine does not seem to be capable of booting from the microSD card slot at all. I was able to boot off a USB-connected drive. Once I set the built-in storage interface mode to AHCI in the BIOS, I was able to complete my installation and everything works great. For the record I installed the ""elementaryOS"" distro.

  I was not sure I would like a Chromebook. Quick start up. Once you figure out how to work off line and navigate, it's not that different from other formats. You can easily add memory via a thumb drive or micro sd card. The only thing I can't do is a wireless connection to my printer.  Small inconvenience for the cost of the laptop.

ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.

  Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.

  Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can’t be downloaded on this chrome book. Internet and everything else works fine, but I bought this for my kids to play Roblox and other apps, but this particular chrome book won’t allow the Google Play store.I had no idea that it was even possible for the Google App Store not to be compatible with a Google Chrome Book!

  Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed.

  Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users.

  I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot.

  Pros:• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

  Purchased this item trying to make sure I got the right item and non-defective so I went with the one sold by Amazon.com. I opened it and started filling out all my information, applying a screen protector and all of this for nothing but madness. I wasted many hours out of my day just to end up returning this item. This was actually labeled with a label printer as Surface Pro 7 on the box but I wanted to make sure I got the right product which I didn't! I actually got a Surface Pro 6. I did not know if this was an intentional scam for all customers or I just had a fluke. Anyways here are the pictures and now I'll be exchanging the item for this same exact one... I mean an actual Surface Pro 7. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR MODEL ONCE YOU RECEIVE THIS ITEM!

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.

  This is a decent hybrid and good for basic browser/tablet tasks. If you try to do much more with it, you might be disappointed. I'm ok with the $350 Black Friday price, but would be disappointed if I spent $500 on this, so giving it 3 stars instead of 4. Paying $600 for the m3 processor would be too much for this class of device, especially with only 4gb ram. It does fine for browsing, but Android apps can be kind of glitchy.  Touch responsiveness can be spotty in tablet mode. This might be ChromeOS' fault, but it's an advertised feature and should be expected to work. Using a 2k external monitor over usb-c works, but is choppy. I'm guessing this is a combination of the low ram and integrated graphics (cpu usage wasn't high). I wouldn't do it regularly. I like that is has 2 usb-c ports, but putting them both on the same side is annoying. The screen half is much heavier than other laptops I've used and makes it hard to balance on your lap. The camera on the body is pointless unless you plan to take photos in tablet mode (don't be that person). The keyboard is fine, but the touchpad is a little cramped. This just comes with the territory on this size device.Basically it does a lot of things adequately and not much more. If you're ok with that, you might like it. For the price, you could get a much better tablet or laptop, but this gives you a little of both.Pros:- USB-C- Screen- Stylus- Size- Build qualityCons:- Speed/responsiveness- Weight (top-heavy screen)- Thickness- Price

  I've been using a chromebook as my primary computer for well over 5 years.  The last one I used was an Acer c720 with an i3 processor, I loved that thing.... I replaced the battery and it still works great but this deal was too good to pass up. $450 for a 7th generation m3 processor convertible chromebook with a dedicated stylus is a great deal.  Considering google is offering free note taking apps on the offers page also sweetens the deal.  In my opinion, this computer is a significantly better value than anything you'd get from a windows computer in this price range.I initially ordered this when it was priced $495 and a 3rd party retailer sent me an xe521qab (dark grey) instead of the listed xe520qab (light grey).  I'm going to compare both units at the end.I'm starting with reviewing the specs and hardware since I think mentioning overall build quality is important and why I chose this unit over others. I'm also going to compare both models since everyone needs to know what they're buying before they actually buy it. I'm also going to touch briefly on the capabilities of Chrome OS and its limitations so first time buyers have an idea what they're getting.Pros:- Convertible, able to run Android apps- Included stylus built into the computer- Fast, low power CPU (fanless computer)- Full HD screen (1920 x 1200 resolution)- Great battery life- Audio is great, just quiet- Linux apps available from within ChromeOS- Keyboard has good travel, very comfortable to type- Trackpad is a good size and is responsiveCons:- No backlit keyboard (some chromebooks in this price range have them)- Can't install any kind of Windows or Mac programs- Will not be able to play computer games, but it can play mobile games from androidProcessor:The processor in this unit is an intel core m3-7y30. To me, this is one of the best processors you can ask for in a Chromebook, but can be underpowered in a Windows laptop. The two specs I feel are most important are 4.5 W TDP and 1.0 ghz - 2.6 ghz clock speed.In layman's terms, this processor has extremely low power requirements which sips power and is able to increase its clock speed high enough to get tasks done. This chip can also hyperthread, basically making it more efficient per core and increasing speed as well.  Because of this low power state, the processor doesn't heat up too much and the computer doesn't need a fan.  The computer makes no noise.  I've noticed zero lag at all, even using the stylus.  This thing is overpowered for most tasks Chrome OS needs. It's a great balance between power needed vs maximizing battery life.To give you an idea on price, this processor's MSRP is $280.  Kind of already covers half of the price of the computer already.Screen:Incredible considering the wide viewing angles, I can see the screen from every angle possible. My old Acer c720 has the worst screen imaginable with a very narrow, low resolution display.  This thing is just as nice as a ""retina"" display in any macbook.Battery:As stated earlier, the M3 processor doesn't use much power compared to other processors, the lack of a fan also saves a lot of power.running a crosh battery test, the rate of decline without running anything is about 1% in 300 seconds, or about 12% an hour.  So I would say best case scenario, 8 - 8.3 hours of battery life.  This is good, not the best, but certainly good enough for me.  I got 3 days of solid use before I needed a new charge.  In comparison, my acer c720 sipped about 1.25% every 300 seconds, or had around 6.7 hours of battery life.  It is older and the CPU's are different, but overall it's significantly better.Audio:Great for a laptop.  Audio has good dynamic range, just no bass.  These are solid speakers and it feels premium, just not nearly as premium as a macbook for instance.Chrome OS:When you buy a Chromebook, you should primarily be using it for web browsing and simple tasks.  If you're tied into google's ecosystem it can do much more. On the other hand, if you're tied into Apple's ecosystem it can be a challenge to use.Chrome OS can't run computer programs built for Windows or Mac, such as microsoft office and photoshop. You can use an online suite of office or the android apps, but they aren’t the same. Setting up a wired printer can be confusing.  Downloading word documents may change the way they look when opened with google docs. Conversely, saving things from google docs to word format may also mess up the formatting, issues I wish would get polished out in the future.Overall, I think chromebooks are absolutely ready for widespread use.  Chrome OS is much more secure than both Windows and Mac's, the fact that you hardly ever download anything keeps the computer fast and secure.  The lightweight OS absolutely flies, for everyday tasks it's much faster than Windows or OS X and you'll notice a difference right away.Linux Programs:Back in the day (6 years ago), you had to sideload a linux OS in order to use linux apps. It worked but was clunky and made it much harder to keep linux up to date.  Plus it took up valuable space on the chromebook and you had to switch OS' completely in order to use them.Today, ChromeOS has a linux virtual machine built into it, and you're able to pull apps from the linux database directly into ChromeOS and run apps.  This is absolutely amazing to me, and I'm not sure when google decided to do this, but it basically makes ChromeOS a near complete machine with much lower limitations.  This gives you access to good program alternatives to photoshop and microsoft office, especially if you need something that does a little bit more than what google apps can do.  This is by no means as nice or complete as Windows or Mac as it still requires knowledge to do it properly and keep it up to date, but it's free and open source, and I think it's important to support that idea.  Linux and Android are the two most popular open source platforms, there's a lot of things you can do with both of them and it's great having both available within Chrome OS.Tablet:This is where ChromeOS is heading towards, so I wouldn't recommend getting a chromebook that isn't convertible at this point.  It's nice to have and makes it able to run android apps.Apps that would be useful on a chromebook would be anything that can take notes and take advantage of a stylus.  It's good for annotating powerpoints, drawing, or taking school notes if you enjoy writing over typing.  Everything else is just gimmicky, but It's still amazing to have an ability to flip the thing around and have a high resolution tablet available.xe520qab vs xe521qab:When I purchased this chromebook, a manufacturer sent me the 521 by mistake, so to get the lower price I had to return it and get the 520.  Amazon unfortunately wasn't able to price match.  I took pictures so everyone can see the difference.The 521 is simply nicer.  It has a darker body, metal keyboard deck, smooth edges; it just feels much better and more expensive. It's rounder in most places, tablet mode feels smoother and better when holding it.  The only two thing I like about the 520 is how it looks when it's closed and it feels better when opening it. The sharp edges are nice and clean, but the plastic keyboard deck just isn’t as comfortable.If you can find the xe521qab for the same price as the xe520qab, I'd pick the 521 in a heartbeat.  Other than that you're getting the exact same thing.  Both are fantastic computers and I'm sure anybody would be happier with either pick.$450 is an absolute steal for either of these computers.

  This is really a high quality machine. The price I paid almost reflected that quality, but I snagged it when an incredible deal was running. The m3 processor is more than enough power to do regular tasks that anyone does online plus all the productivity work that is needed in a workplace. My wife is a teacher and this was purchased for her, so most of this feedback is from what she's said as she's used it.First, let's talk about the display. It really is a beautiful display with accurate-enough colors. It gets a little over-saturated in some situations and under-saturated in others, creating some awkward hue on backgrounds of darker movies or webpages. But those are only noticeable while objects are moving (or when you're scrolling) and there's a lot of action on the screen. It gets bright enough for most situations and in the previous Pro model I wondered why it got as bright as it did. Watching reviews it seemed like you almost don't need to use a lamp to lighten a room, just turn the display face up and turn it up; that should be plenty to light an entire bedroom.Second is the quality of the material. The device feels like a brushed aluminum or other metal material with some plastic in some places. This is about right for the price, considering an even better quality of material would get you easily spending $900+. The keyboard feels fantastic and the touchscreen hasn't had a single hiccup yet after about 2 months of use.Third, let's talk about functionality. And, before we begin, let's remember this is a Chromebook. This wasn't purchased to play the latest games or sync with Microsoft or Apple services. It's a Samsung product running a Google operating system, meaning that it's meant to work with Google services. That said, it works wonderfully for Google Drive (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). This item is used almost exclusively to do lesson planning, grading, research, and other tasks that a teacher would do. For that, it's perfect. The only real issues we've had entail poor web design and a lack of websites switching to HTML5 instead of Flash.All in all, if you're wanting the performance of a Google Pixelbook and similar functionality then you won't be disappointed. If you want to get a loved one a computer that will really allow them to use the Internet without too much worry about viruses, then you're making a good purchase. If you're intending to get a laptop that can run Android apps without too much of a ""herky jerky"" experience, then you're making a good purchase. If you're wanting a computer that can run Photoshop, render 4K videos, or anything like that, then you're better off with other products.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 13"" Laptop, FHD (1920 x 1080) Touch Display, Intel Core i3-10110U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 64GB eMMC, Intel Integrated Graphics, Chrome OS, 82B80006UX, Graphite Grey",$397.12,5,"
  Best bang-for-your-buck Chromebook, with the beauty of a high-end yet overly priced Samsung, Asus, or Pixelbook. This little book is perfect in almost every way.In general, this Chromebook is perfect for what I bought it for: work-related tasks on the web, surfing the web, using Google Docs to type up documents & write lyrics for songs, and organizing thoughts and ideas into productivity apps and jotting down tasks in my Microsoft To-Do list app.  This Chromebook is lightning fast in powering up, connecting to WiFi & Bluetooth, and opening apps & browsers.The Screen size is non-jeopardizing; large enough for a functional workspace, but small enough to easily store away in a backpack. Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you're trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It's quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It's back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you're used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don't have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn't been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn't completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.

  Revised - 3/9/21As others have complained, the right hinge for the monitor is defective. I can't open/close the laptop unless I do it very slow using two hands so the monitor would not break. From what all are saying I guess I am SOL. I will contact Lenovo none the less to see if the will fix this.Revised - 9/30/20I must apologize to Lenovo. The issues I was facing was from my own doing. I forgot that I had set the OS to dev mode sometime ago and that was causing the device to act up. After setting the OS back to standard mode, it is running smoothly not freezing once.  All our headache went away.  Back to 5 stars!Revised - 9/24/20Stay AWAY!! Now the sound is going away during my daughter's virtual class.  We need to restart the device in order to get the sound back.  I would stay away from this device if you need something for school.  Our first Chromebook so not sure if this is normal for Chromebook.  Very dissapointed to say the least.Revised - 9/23/20Our device is starting to freeze daily and needing restart.  This is extremely frustrating for my 4th grade daughter when learning virtually.  It is not like she has too many files or apps open so I'm down grading this to three stars.With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14"" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3"" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We'll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I'm still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it's not that difficult.  It's no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of us：）

  After six months of use the right hinge broke and started flexing the screen out.Looks like a bad design. Lenovo repair has you fill out a repair ticket but no info as where to send it, RMA or any other info.I have laptops that are over four years old and dont have any problems with hinges.*UPDATE* Lenovo fixed the hinge but broke the covers in the processes. Looks like they used a crowbar to pry them off. Took three months to get the unit back.  I would look at the Acer Spin over this.

  I've used quite a few Chromebooks before (Samsung, Pixelbook, Acer, HP). This time I wanted something that had a 14"" Full HD screen and an Intel Core i3+ processor (main for my children to use), but also wanted something that was snappy.For $400, this Chromebook has been impressive and has a solid build and is fairly lightweight.- Keyboard is great with keys nicely placed.- The HD touchscreen is sharp- The unit performs well with a moderate amount of tabs open, streaming two Youtube videos is no problem.- The flip screen is a nice touch- There's a good # of ports as well (dual USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, mini-SD card slot)- The webcam is great for video conferencing (even comes with a neat built-in webcam cover ).- Installing apps from the Google Play store was simple enough.It is a great Chromebook this price point!

  What can I say it’s just as good as I thought it would be. It’s well made and very fast! My other laptop that runs windows 10 has a i7, 8GB of ram, and a SSD. This feels just as fast (or faster) for half the price and better portability.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"" Laptop, 15.6"" HD (1366 x 768) Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 128GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics, Windows 10, 81W10094US, Business Black",$359.99,3,"
  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it! Shipping was very fast, and the customer service I received from HALF TIME was executive level. I would recommend this machine for anyone doing lite gaming, or any schoolwork.

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install. Everything is working as intended. I would recommend This Laptop. I like the auto on feature and the 4 digit pin login, makes it easy to get to work.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

  Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it’s honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I’ve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME!

  Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back.

  Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I’m putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won’t make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again.

  Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn’t as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. – Happy Mommy!

  I bought this MacBook as I needed a well built (long lasting), fast, compact laptop that can handle day to day tasks in addition to creative work down the road (I am trying to get into Photography and Video Editing). This laptop checked everything off my list.In addition, I wanted a laptop that can seamlessly sync with my phone (iPhone 11 Pro). I love that I can answer calls, respond to texts, and read emails between all of my devices automatically without having to really set anything up or picking up my phone. The screen is also one of the best to look at in my opinion.I briefly had the 2019 entry level model of the MacBook Pro 13 with 2 ports but I quickly returned it as the 2 ports where quite limiting, I wasn't satisfied with the performance, and the butterfly keyboard was not my favorite and gave me anxiety. I am glad I waited a bit longer for this refresh before going for the higher end model as I am actually saving money as I did not have to purchase upgrades to get the 16 gigs of ram I wanted and I also get twice the storage as well which means I don't have to buy an external SSD, until I am much closer to starting creative work.So far I am very impressed with the MacBook Pro and it is so far my favorite laptop to date solely because it works so well with other gadgets I have. The only thing I could nitpick is it still feels expensive for the specs but you get what you pay for, this is a sturdy/premium feeling laptop and blows away any of the laptops I have purchased in the past that feel cheap. If I run into any issues I will update my review but I can't wait to dive in further.

  This is my first mac computer and coming from windows based computers this thing is amazing. I don't think ill ever go back to a windows pc. As with all apple products the quality and feel is the best. As for the computer itself it arrived in perfect condition and a day early. The new 2020 13"" works flawless absolutely zero issues with setup and initial operation as is expected with the apple premium paid. If you're debating on switching to macbook pro or upgrading your older macbook I don't think you'll be disappointed.

  Compared to laptop PCs I've owned, the battery life on this is terrible. I have to charge it a couple times throughout the day (I'm not even a ""power user""). Other than that, it seems to work okay. It's NOT as fast as I thought it would be, coming from using a 3-year old Dell XPS 13. I thought this would be so much faster than that, but it's only a minor noticeable difference. Not sure it's worth the price, since a PC with similar (or better) specs can be had for less money. There have also been issues with the ambient light switching between blue to ambient-- that's annoying (a quick online search will show that others have had this issue too). Also, when I try to update some apps it says, """"...cannot be updated because it was refunded or purchased with a different Apple ID"" -- maybe this was a returned machine? If so, that's not good either. IDK.

  This is first time I am posting review and I am very frustrated with amazon. Actually I am prime member since 2016 and I but almost every week from amazon. This is the first time i am very disappointed. Package arrived 1 week delay than guaranteed delivered date by UPS. I ordered new macbook with 16 gb ram and 1tb ssd but received 8gb ram and 256 ssd probably old released macbook. I opened laptop about 40 minutes and setup all necessary steps and it just blinked few times and shutdown automatically and didn't turn on back, I put laptop in charge but it didn't response anything.  I called to amazon technical support and one gentleman tried to help me out but didn't work and he connected call to apple store with export and finally that man asked me serial number and after checking serial number, he said it's not 2020 16gb ram, 1tb ssd laptop, than I checked laptop box and it said 8gb ram, 256 gb ssd.Because of covid 19, my all classes is in online so I tried to work whatever I got but it even didn't turn on. It's so frustrating. Finally I decided to return it and get windows from best buy.

  This review has to do with Amazon’s customer service during my entire experience with returning this laptop. Safe yourself the trouble purchase directly through apple and save your self the money and headache . I returned the laptop since it did this weird glitching twice and for a brand new laptop I did not feel that was a good sign so I returned it ....... then the nightmare started. After two week I called because I did not receive any correspondence. I called and found out the laptop was received a week earlier . The agent said they were testing the item , which I understand it’s a more expensive item and they have their procedures. I called back a week later and the agent was like oh that’s weird I don’t know why they didn’t release the funds so he went ahead and did it and then explained that because it was a “large amount” it would have to be in three releases.... $1700 for Amazon is pocket change . But I was like whatever as long as I get my money back . Now here i am a month later on the phone as I type this STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK!!! BUY YOUR APPLE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM APPLE YOUVE BEEN WARNED !

  As a long time Mac User, my old macbook is still holding up pretty well! I was expecting to upgrade to the rumored 14 inch Macbook Pro, but it did come.After window shopping a lot of PC Laptops, especially Dell XPS, I am still convinced making right choice buying this once I open the package. Apple still delivers the best quality product!PC vs. Mac?PC may seems offering better value, they are NOT stable, after 2 years usage, it would comes with millions of glitches.Mac = STABLE, No Hassle, functioning good for years!

  Heck, dollar for dollar this is the GAMING rig to beat.Item of Note:There IS a 2.5” hard drive caddy/cable with this model. Also the 2nd M.2 slot does show up if you put a NVME in there (not sure about SATA m.2 as I didn’t have one to test). It is standard 80mm size, same as the main slot, and seems to have extra room above/below it so I believe something double sided would fit, as would something with a SMALL heatsink on top (like say the Adata Swordfish one).Screen:Most of the other gaming laptops in the $750-1100 range have dim ~250 nit screens with awful <50% color gamuts. This one, 300nit rated (~330 actual based on reviews) 144hz and 100% srgb. It is striking, you won’t find a screen like this in this price range elsewhere.Power:Then you have a 8c/16t 4800H processor, which netted just under 4700 on Cinebench R20 in Performance Mode. For reference, my desktop running a Ryzen 3700X 8c/16t scores between 4600 and 4800 depending on background software and performance settings.Memory:The ram is ideal, 3200mhz, 16gb, you don’t want any less because that’s the lower limit for gaming and productivity, and you don’t want any more because each 8gb is about 3watts of power consumption. Not sure if it supports 32gb, I can’t see 16gb being the limit but the Lenovo Support responders in Q&A here seem to think it is.Battery.:It would be nice if they had any prebuilt options with the 80wh version, but they don’t, and I took a star off for that. Most of us would gladly pay an extra $50+ for that option. And I don’t feel like waiting 5+ weeks (2 months? 3?) for a custom one just to get it. That being said, with proper settings this 60wh can be sufficient.*Quiet Mode (fn+q until power led turns blue)*Battery Save mode on (click on battery icon, slide all the way to left)*Hybrid Mode on (this is ESSENTIAL, it shuts off the dedicated graphics card when not needed)*In Advanced Power Settings, adjust all of the AMD, Wireless, etc settings to their most ‘battery saving’ optionDoing all that I’m getting over 5 hours browsing the internet, longer if I have the internet open and am mostly working in excel or word (ie: normal school work/reports for office/etc). For instance, editting this review in the Amazon window, 4.1 hours remaining w/ 55% (7.5 hours total est). 7-8 hours watching Youtube @720p in Edge. Brightness at whatever battery saver drops it to when it’s on high to begin with. I intend on trying to swap in an 80wh when the parts are available.Build quality:The fit/finish and overall feel of the unit hits above its price point. The keyboard is exceptional for productivity, aside from the slightly cramped numpad. The touchpad is responsive. The rear I/O ports are great for desktop duty. But lets be real, Lenovo doesn’t exactly have a great reputation when it comes to customer service and turnaround times for repairs. None of the laptop manufacturers do though really, save Apple. My last Lenovo, a Y700, lasted over 5 years. I figure, get it, do some stress testing on the processor/GPU (Cinebench, Furmark), watch some movies and do some white/black backgrounds to check for dead pixels, and cross your fingers. To extend warranty through them is $50/100/175 for 1/2/3 extra years respectively, I personally am planning at least the $50 for an extra year.Heat:There is one drawback, this thing gets hot. I was expecting better thermals as I tested out a Legion 5 with the 4600H + 1650ti combo a while back. I would say this one runs ~5c average hotter across the board, and will spike to 95-100C+ if you’re doing something intense like Cinebench or Flight Sim 2020. In Flight Sim, average CPU temps over a 20 min flight were ~76c, CPU Die avg was ~85C. Temps are lower playing less demanding games, and even normally demanding games like AC Origins CPU avg was low 70’s, so not terrible. I spent some time looking into this, and apparently these hopped up gaming laptops hitting 90-100C is ‘okay’, even if I don’t really like or trust it. Also, the only option I know of that actually runs cooler than this with similar hardware is the Omen 15 AMD, so if temps are a priority may want to check that platform out. The Asus Tuf’s are as hot if not hotter, and the Dell G5 SE is a small portable sun. However, you do get something for this heat, the aforementioned Cinebench scores blow the competition out of the water, I still can’t believe it’s on par with my desktop processor.Final Thoughts:This thing runs warm, looks good (if you like the aesthetic), has a phenomenal spec sheet for the price, and has best in class screen for a non special-order low-mid budget prebuilt. Would recommend, with the one slight caveat regarding heat.

  This laptop is good, performance, design, screen and fast.However, something is wrong.First of all, I always check hard disk whenever I buy a laptop since I sometimes experienced receiving used laptop instead of new. It happened to this laptop. I check hard disk and it was turned on 208 times before.It might be program error but as far as I know, they are pretty accurate(crystal disk info) It looks new but might be not. Maybe I am unlucky. I will post another review later after I investigate more.update 1.So, My purchase date and warranty start date are different.Usually, warranty starts when I first install Windows and turn on laptop first time.This laptop had started warranty about more than 1 month ago, it doesn't any make sense to me.I talked about it with Amazon customer service and what they said is 'just return it',So disappointing so far.

  Edit 2: have been using the laptop for few month. No issues at all. Love it. Will move it back to 4 stars..........Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review. After 10 days, this vertical line appeared and it's constant through all applications, even in Bios. Meaning this is a hardware defect. Will change my review to one star for poor quality control. I have returned the laptop and Amazon honored 30 day return window. The new units doesn't have this line. Will see if the same problems happens in the next few weeks.............................If you're not willing wait to RTX 3000. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. The build quality is good. Fan is quite and powerful. Love it.I've been using the laptop now for a week. It's much better than what I thought. Super quite when you need it be quite. Powerful when you need it to be powerful. I actually returned the Helios 300, which I bough for 999 as well on a deal. Helios 300 has RTX 2060 which is not so different from 1660 Ti (Don't let them fool you). .With helios noise at idle is just unbearable, Intel heat is ridiculous as well and the build quality doesn't come close Legion 5.  Legion 5 Beats it at all the way. .

  I really like the new design. It looks like a workstation more than a gaming laptop!I'm gonna try and keep this short:PROS:- build quality is excellent,- specs are insane,- 2.5kg and the dimensions make it really portable,- screen is amazing! 144Hz and 300nits.- Ryzen 7 4800H...- GTX 1660ti is great for video editing and gaming!- laptop feels premium!CONS:- speakers are mediocre. Volume is decent but the sound quality is ok.-battery is really bad...less that 4 hours.- there is no international warranty (now this is Lenovo fault)!To be honest, this laptop is best buy at this price (999$). I'm really glad I bought it!Edit:There is a lot of problems with Linux...I actually thought Lenovo was the best with open source drivers and support for Linux...I was wrong.I can't run Linux, I can't have warranty in my own country, I can't have normal battery life. I guess I'll return it!Edit 2:I have random freezes. It just stops responding while doing random stuff. Returning it!

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS 11.6"" HD Intel Celeron Processor N4000 4GB RAM 32GB eMMC Gigabit Wi-Fi - XE310XBA-K01US",$186.05,2,"
  About Me/ExpectationsI purchased this chromebook after having a wonderful experience with the Samsung Chromebook 3. I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram—I had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can’t do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn’t had a chromebook or hasn’t updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn’t wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it’s far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine—this one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn’t because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn’t because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn’t break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don’t hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like—I did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn’t been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn’t worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don’t select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product.

  I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.

  This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life. The display is not as good as those laptops costing 2 to 4 times as much but it is fine for daily use and I don't find it be a problem even when using it for long periods of time.

  This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!

  Listen, this is a sub $300 Chromebook— they had to cut costs somewhere. Is the TN panel great? No. But this laptop cost me $302 with tax, has 6gb of RAM and 64gb of storage, will be updated at least until 2026,  also does what I need it to do (homework/writing). I have the Samsung Chrome book 3 too, and the 4 is a nice upgrade. This is a light laptop with a small footprint. so I can easily carry it back and forth to campus. Also, the new design is freaking sexy. Probably my favorite laptop of all time.

  I ordered this for my wife. It is perfect for her to surf the Internet and check email quickly. As others have said, the screen could be better. The screen is not good when viewed at from an angle. But then, it's an inexpensive item. It's the first Chromebook I've ever purchased. The speed is great. It boots almost instantly. It has great battery life. It is very light. The keyboard is responsive. It has to USB 3.0 ports and bluetooth. I connected an inexpensive bluetooth mouse to the system without a problem. My wife could not be happier.

  I bought 2 of these computers for my kids for virtual learning.  One works great, the other started having problems just 1-2 weeks after school started.  I tried to return/exchange at that time and I was connected with HP support.  HP support assured me this was a one time issue and not to return, but to troubleshoot.  I troubleshooted for about 2 hours and the problem appeared to be fixed.  But now, 3 weeks later (and now out of the ""return period""), and the same issue happening, plus it will not start up at all.  Now I cannot return and HP is requesting $$ for me to ship to them so they can fix it.  Extremely disappointed.

  Great little computer, I have only had it for 4 days, but so far so good. I purchased this for my son who will be doing remote learning when school starts back up next month. The set up was easy, the computer talks you through the whole process if you allow it to by selecting the voice prompt. My son loves it, especially the blue metallic color, its small but for an elementary school student, its perfect. Now the only question is will it last, I did get the warranty, just in case.

  Purchased as a gift for a student. She is so pleased! Highly recommended! Not for gaming and that sort, but working well for academic purposes!

  This laptop wasn't what I expected but it's functional. It has very little storage space so an external drive is a must unless you rely on storing in a cloud. Did not have room to install alot of the applications I use daily, like the Microsoft Office suite or Gmail. The windows system on it was very hard to manage making it impossible to install what you need without going through Microsoft Office store and getting a knock-off version of the app you really want so it was a bit of a nuisance.  Did not have the ports that I need for an Ethernet hookup. Even though it has wireless capability, I like the option to connect when the WiFi is not strong. I would recommend this for small children as a starter laptop.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Windows Tablet 10in, Ultra Slim Windows 10 Tablet PC - 4GB RAM 64GB Storage, 5MP and 2MP Cameras, 1280x800 IPS HD Display, Black",$240.59,2,"
  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  Yo he tenido laptops HP que me han durado pero lamentablemente en esta ocasión no tuve la misma suerte con este modelo y proveedor ya que desde el primer día tuvo problemas con la actualización e inicio para ingresar al sistema. Toda esta semana he estado llamando a soporte de HP y no se ha logrado resetear el sistema por lo que decidí iniciar el proceso de reembolso y devolución. Ha sido mucho desgaste mental en lidiar con una laptop que se supone que al ser nueva debe trabajar óptimamente. Solo espero que la resolución de reembolso y devolución termine bien con Amazon ya que el envío de devolucion desde Costa Rica costo mucho dinero por lo que ojalá este comentario llegue al proveedor que por supuesto no lo recomiendo. Ya lo pensaré bien en adquirir otra laptop desde este medio ya que se complica la devolución. Así que les recomiendo que compren con calma.

  I have had good luck with HP computers and this is not an exception. All hardware features seem good, though Bluetooth is sometimes flaky. Though not specifically an HP issue, on the down side MS Windows is too insistent that you use their browser, login to an MS account (why?), and download only their apps. Funny, I thought I paid for Windows when I bought the computer but I guess MS believes they have the right to nag the user forever.

  This is a good decent laptop for school kids or college students. Not for business use. The specs on the sellers site are deceiving. The screen quality is not what it says. It's just a typical LCD screen that has a little more brightness than it's older predecessor. It does not have backlit keys and the keyboard lettering can't hardly be seen.The laptop feels cheap and fragile. I get worried when carrying it. Hard drive is not upgradeable. The battery life does not last as long as stated in the Sellers site. We ran tests using several programs and browsing the internet. Overall, it is not designed for creative design. As stated it is good for home use, school kids and college students. Not good for traveling even though it is a little light and it is overpriced. We donated ours to a school.

  I've had this product for about a month and really have no complaints.  Boots up quick with no delay.  My only issue is with the on/off switch.  It's too small.  Also, I miss not having an indicator light showing when ""caps lock"" is on.  Other than these two issues I really like the unit!

  Great laptop. Even tho its a 3070 you still gotta mess w nvidias 3D settings and with the games internal vsync settings to really optimize each game. 360 hz is awsome but don't play demanding games at high settings with 360 hz cause the screen completely glitches out. Took me a week of internal pain to figure that out. They run smooth at 60hz w vsync (depending on game) though. For games that don't have a refresh rate option in their settings (weird but games such as Sniper Elite 4 don't have it) go to the razer synapses and change it in the performance tab to 60. Then when ur done playing go back and change it to 360 if you want. Kinda a hassle but that's what you get with a machine like this. You just can't win lol. Overall awsome powerhouse that's so slim and fits right in your backpack without taking much space. But omg the power supply is so thiccc. Battery life is awsome, given that it's an insanely powerful gaming laptop. Lasts almost 3 hours when using google nonstop. Look if you want battery life get a Mac. But for gaming this thing rocks. Just have some patience and once you set up everything you'll begin planning your wedding to this thing. Peace.

  I was actually surprised at how well this computer performs while multitasking. I use this laptop with an external monitor as well as a Bluetooth mechanical keyboard. Right now it’s my daily driver for a workstation until my new desktop comes in and it’s getting the job done. It is capable of getting 144fps in Fortnite I haven’t tried any other games on it though.

  First things first, I am writing this review on this laptop right now, and it's absolutely amazing for typing, the touchpad is nice and responsive, and the screen is vibrant and bright. My only gripes are with two things. One:  The battery management system, tries its best to switch between the Nvidia gpu and the integrated one, but ultimately doesn't pick the one I would have wanted 30% of the time, and I need to go into the Nvidia contol panel to change it, then restart the laptop. Also, due to the fact that drainning a lithium battery too quickly damages it, the laptop reduces the maximum performance when not plugged in. I can reasonably get 5 or 6 hours of use out of it when I'm not doing more than browsing or watching a video, but if you plan on gaming while on bettery you're looking at no more than an hour and a half.Two: The surface finish is impossible to keep clean. it looks great if you wipe it down with a microfiber cloth, but as soon as you touch it, there's fingerprints everywhere, and it looks like I just mashed a greasey cheeseburger all over it. I might get a vinyl skin for the lid and the palm rest, but i'll wait and see how bad it really is. This next part is not Razer's fault, but just a problem I had with Corsair's Icue peripheral service. I installed Icue to integrate with mouse and my headphones, and I noticed that I was getting only 2 hours of bettery life, which confused me. It turns out the driver was hitting the cpu with just enough requests that it was running at its full frequency all the time. I had to just uninstall it to get my 6 hours of battery life back. Other than that, this laptop manages to pack an insane amount of power and performance into a surprisingly thin but dense package, and I love that about it. It feels solid and has almost no plastic and no cheap feeling parts. When it's plugged in I can barely tell the difference bewteen it and my desktop at home which really shows just how far technology has improved in just a year. Funnily enough, the silicon shortage has hit other manufactureres so bad, that their cheaper plastic laptops with the same parts are actually more expensive that this much nicer product. I plan on keeping this for a long time, and I can definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a product that they plan on using for workstation or gaming purposes.

  I purchased this because my son needed my laptop. At first, I thought it was great. All I really did was search the web and visit sites. It's fast and nice for that. Once I downloaded my Silhouette Studio program, I have trouble now doing anything due to low disc space. This is pretty upsetting since this is the only program I have downloaded. I don't stream Netflix or anything like that. I didn't realize how bad it was until months later now that I need to work on projects with this software. I don't recommend using this for a cricut or silhouette.

  I purchased this computer purposely for school and web surfing. The computer has nice looking features and it hasn’t given me any problems. However, I would not recommend it for anything other than web surfing, reading articles, doing research and typing up documents. This computer has very little storage room. I am unable to save all of my school related documents due to this issue. Other than that, it’s great. Also, you’ll have to get a mouse. Using the finger touch mouse on the lap top can get annoying.

  I bought this laptop for my daughter to use for school.  She is ten.  We received it and almost immediately, it stopped charging.  I thought, no big deal, it's probably a defective charger.  I bought a new charger.  Same thing.  So I contacted HP Support.  They fixed the computer and sent it back to me.  However, they reinstalled Windows 10, which deleted my one year free trial of Microsoft Office.  I contacted them about this and they said that I would just have to download the one month free trial or purchase it for $69.99.  I specifically purchased this laptop for the one year free trial and HP refuses to fix the problem that is THEIR fault.  If it hadn't been for a faulty laptop in the first place, it wouldn't have needed to have Windows reinstalled.  I will never again purchase an HP product.  Buyer, beware!

  Honestly if you wanna computer for school with the basic needs this computer is for you. I don’t get how people complain about the storage but honestly you can buy the SD card and put it in your computer and you can have more storage at the beginning I was debating Whether to buy it but I ended up buying it and it works amazing and it looks fabulous on my desk. love the color couldn’t ask for more . The way they pack the computer to ship it to you is well done.I’m really happy with my purchase :)

  I really wanted to love this laptop but I am a bit disappointed. It’s great quality for such a low price. However, all of the apps I want to download, such as Facebook I can not find on the App Store.

  I have been looking at many models of laptops for gaming.  It was coming down to the blade, asus zephyrus m15 or the msi gs66.  I ended up with the blade because I just thought screw it and went with the most expensive one.  I have researched ALOT leading up to me deciding which to buy.  Ive seen and read the horror stories people posted on reviews and reddit about Razer's QC.  I also have seen very satisfied customers too so I prayed for the best.  Luckily my unit after I have been using for about 3,4 days now have no problem at all.  I see no major screen bleeding at all there is very small bleed on the right hand corner but basically that's it.The keyboards are not very to my liking.  I was using Lenovo Y520 before this and even on that cheap model, the keyboards were way better for me.  I think that the blade keyboards are abit too mushy for me.The speakers are also abit on the weaker side.  I wish they would just be a little more meaty.  I'm not sure how to explain it but even my old Lenovo was better and i hated those.The top part of the chassis near the screen gets VERY hot when under heavy loud like gaming.  I couldnt touch it for more than 3,4 seconds, but then again noone touches that area anyway so it doesnt really matter.  It also got cool to the touch very fast though after you stop gaming which really surprised me.All in all those are really the only thing I ""dislike"".  They really are nit picky but im actually really pleased with this device.  I will try to post here again if i encounter any problems later on.  For now i think they are great.  I also mostly see reported problems on last year's model with the i7 9th gen and this years 1660ti gpu model.  If I were you I would try to avoid those and get the more expensive one just in case.  All in all this is a good buy for me, just pray you get a good working model and you wont regret it!

  Shortly after arrival the laptop needed to be returned due to a fan issue.  It arrived back at the manufacturer one week ago.  Manufacturer support has been very polite in responding to my grandsons inquiries and informing him a new laptop would be sent.  He is disappointed and anxious and was told today that it will be shipped in 3-5 days.  He loved it for about 2 weeks before it had to be returned and what was supposed to be a special gift is now more concern than celebration.  As the purchaser, I'd like a definitive response to when it will arrive.  If that isn't possible, I'd prefer a refund for the laptop and the protection plan.

  Laptop is wonderful. well built, sleek and compact. the screen is beautiful and it runs very demanding games, albeit at pretty high temps. seriously gets hot, but it's a gaming laptop. only other gripe with the laptop itself is the rubber bumpers on the bottom are uneven and makes it wobble a bit. shouldn't be a terribly hard fix though.Amazon on the other had is what drags this review down. They have some false advertisements on the page. the main one being the store page says it has a touch screen, while it doesn't.  Had to talk to 4 reps trying to add the insurance to the purchase (store page says you can add it up to 30 days from purchase) only to be told they couldn't do it. 3 of the people just hung up without saying a word. The last one said all I can do to get what I wanted is to return the laptop, wait 2-3 weeks for amazon to receive it (even though I got it in one) and then wait another week for my refund, then repurchase the laptop and add the insurance. while I would like very much to do that, I need this laptop for work as well as gaming so I can't really be without it for so long.Oh, and as it's an expensive delivery, they require a signature for drop off. I took the day off and hangout waiting for the delivery only for the amazon driver to just throw it on my porch and leave without so much as ringing the bell.TLDR; laptop is great, purchase it if you see a decent sale, just don't bother purchasing through amazon. Too much hassle to deal with their incompetence.

  I could immediately tell from the packaging that Razer is not messing around. Everything was professionally packaged and upon opening, everything is high quality and created with love of gaming in mind.This computer runs great, plays all my games on max settings and doesn't get too loud. The screen, keyboard, speakers, trackpad, RGB, everything is top notch as I expected it to be. I bought a Bluetooth Razer mouse to go along with it and I now have the ultimate laptop gaming setup.Thank you Razer.

  This laptop was clearly not functional within an hour of setting it up.  It bluescreens constantly, and none of the typical things you'd do to diagnose and fix the bluescreens fixed it.  This included a total fresh reinstall of Windows as well as a number of software diagnostics recommended by Lenovo.  None of it worked.  This is clearly a hardware problem, so I returned it.  Amazon's return policy states that if they disagree with your assessment that the computer doesn't work, they'll charge you a fee ($165) for restocking.  That's what they did to me.  So they intend to sell you the same broken laptop they sold me.  Buyer beware!

  This is my 1st gaming laptop and I did a ton of research before pulling the trigger. For the price, it's a beast. Unfortunately mine is defective and drops 15-21% of frames in high resolution video playback. I bought it for 4k video editing as well as gaming so this is a BIG issue. I'm now wrestling with Lenovo to get it fixed or replaced. I 'd like to return it but at this point I wish I had researched the seller a little. Please don't misunderstand, their price was great, shipping was very fast but their return policy is so harshly rigid its clear they do not actually accept returns.  Words of warning: if you order from them, keep everything associated w your package and keep it in perfect condition. If you try for a return(good luck!) repack everything so that it looks as though the box was never opened, if not it will be rejected and you are paying shipping both ways. I will update this review once my machine is fixed or replaced.

  love the design not only is this laptop a beast at gaming ,but also looks and feels sleek and doesn't just look like a gaming laptop. The main games i play are rust and modern warfare , they run amazing at high settings. The fan noise isn't to bad either i have owned a older laptop before hand and that one was much much louder. screen is a bit small for me for gaming ,but thats because im used to a 27 inch monitor from my desk top. The only  thing i can think about disliking is the 512 ssd storage ,but you can always just unscrew the 11 screws on the bottom and plug a 2 tb ssd right next to it so not really a big deal. If you need a portable ,fast ,sleek gaming laptop this is the one for you.

  A vertical line appeared on the screen, I read reviews of the 1660ti variant and some users have had the same issue. I used this laptop very  lightly and carefully during 2 weeks, sometimes I opened it and the screen was black and sometimes I couldn't adjust brightness.

  The laptop shipped quickly.  It appears pretty sturdy, though a bit plasticky.  The keyboard is great, much better feel than my work laptop or my older samsung laptop.  The screeen is bright and sharp.  I'm impressed by the system speed.  Proper dual channel 3200MHz ram, fast 4800H cpu.  While running a few quick tests, the system was running 4.09GHz all core for the cpu-z stress test.  The fans are quiet and the keyboard and deck area were cool during ~20 minutes of gaming.  There are always better products on the horizon, but overall I'm pleased with this laptop.Update 5-10-21:  I continue to be impressed with this laptop.  It runs newer games very well and older games at ridiculous frame rates ( Portal and Talos Principle running at 200+ FPS).  The cooling system works very well and the integrated graphics can run many of my games at reasonable frame rates.  The battery life isn't that great, but long enough to watch a movie. Very pleased for the price.

  Laptop came factory sealed and in perfect condition. Beast Amd 2060 115w!*1 month update*I've traveled with it and used it pretty heavily and can say that this thing is amazing. Games run smooth, cyber punk on ultra with rtx on dlss on balanced I get about 55 fps, no rtx I can get 70+ on ultra. Temps are ridiculously low, gpu never goes over 70c at 97 to 99% performance. I'm coming from console so I was very skeptical of gaming on a laptop but I'm pretty sure I'll never buy a console ever again. After playing on ultra in a few games trying to play games on ps4 looks awful, I understand why pc players never turn back to consoles. This laptop provides the same games with better graphics at higher frame rates and its portable!

  This laptop has everything you need to game. RTX 2060 115W variant? Yes sir and also a chasis and cooling system good enough to handle it. AMD Ryzen 7 4800H? 8 cores and 16 threads? 4.2Ghz core speed? Oh yeah, best mobile CPU of 2020, yeah Intel i7 10750H can turbo 1 core to 5Ghz and gains like 3-5 FPS more, but its a 6 core CPU with heating issues unless you undervolt.

  This HP Chromebook looks and feels far more expensive and better made than its price led me to believe. The keyboard is outstanding with a soft but firm touch. My wife has never been a fan of touch pads, but she likes this touch pad so much that she no longer connects a mouse to use with this HP. The convertible and touch screen are just great added bonuses.We purchased this as an Amazon refurbished model and were thrilled that it actually did arrive ""like new"".

  I've been breaking in this puppy for a week now and feel motivated to write a review.  First off there are a couple of inaccuracies in the description--the computer DOES have a touch screen, and the RAM speed is 1600MHz, not 3200Mhz.  Beyond that all is described okay.I spent a couple of days burning in the computer with the freeware benchmarking program SiSoft Sandra Lite...no real surprises there.  The system outranked 87 percent of their database, with excellent scores for the processor, SSD drive and RAM (even though it's only 1600MHz).  It only garnered poor scores for its graphics, so if you're at all into 3D gaming look elsewhere.  For my uses it should be fine, though I would have liked to see a graphics score that wasn't bottom of the barrel.  My only other minor gripe is the color quality--initially videos appeared too dark.  I downloaded AMD's Radeon Software package, which allows me to adjust the brightness, hue and color temperature and I'm still dialing it in.So what do I like about it?  Lots of things.  I appreciate the backlit keyboard.  Though I use a mouse, the touchpad is better than many I've experienced.  The keyboard feel is good.  One reason I went for a 15-incher over a 14 was the numeric keypad, which I like.  Though I've used it very little so far, the touch screen simplifies some tasks.  I appreciate the full-HD 1920 x 1080 screen resolution--My last laptop was 1024 x 768 and this has much less eyestrain.  I like the 15.6"" screen much better than a 14"".  The screen is also visible from different angles.  I like the thin case and the light weight.  The 16GB RAM is overkill for me but it's nice to have it there for multi-tasking and video editing if I need it.This beast is a full-featured computer for well under $1000.  It's about the same price as those glorified tablets from Microsoft, Google and Apple with 10""-12"" screens, tiny drives and slower processors.  It hits a sweet spot in several areas for me...I spent a lot of time researching the purchase to include all the features I wanted.

  loving my new computer, the only thing complaint i have is that i can't use the fingerprint sign it. I've been able to use it once !

  I found this laptop to be very snappy & high quality. The specs speak for themselves. The screen is beautiful & the touchscreen feature is nice to have.

  It has been like this for hours, can't shut down can't do anything!

  What initially attracted me to the laptop was the price for the specs and processor offered. it's a durable laptop with a nice display and the laptop is very fast with an SSD. The fingerprint reader is also great I thought that was a nice touch. Unfortunately just like everything else in this world this item has flaws. The first flaw I would like to mention is it overheats very quickly.  Also, the battery isn't very good I assume the battery life is average though. It also isn't the best laptop for running games it does better on some games more than others. Just depends on what games you like. Granted, this laptop wasn't made for running games. Overall, I would still reccomend this laptop to a friend.

  I was so disappointed. This laptop had everything that I had hoped for except that the screen was so dim. Unfortunately I did return it because I couldn’t stand that even on full brightness it was lackluster. Other than screen brightness this laptop has it all.

  I needed a more powerful graphics card than my ancient desktop AiO for modern image processing software. This one fit the bill. One of the approved processors was a Radeon. Since I was getting a Radeon, I got a Ryzen 7 4700U. Plenty of power.My only real complaint is the micro SD card slot instead of a full size. I took an old 32 GB card and put it in as an additional drive. I use a USB adapter for full size SD cards. Waste not, want not.Add a wireless mouse and done. I'm still looking for a good prop to elevate the keyboard a bit. The power brick works. So does the umbrella from my briefcase. Both are a bit higher than I need, although the umbrella has a nice damped feel.5/12 Update: There were too many dongles, so I added:A bit more memory--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0887P21Z2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_3SB2H3CXT0H0F1JFN968?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1A Bluetooth mouse--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07C2NL5HK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_2RT9G4WET9CRGTEMPR1M?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1A USB-C card reader for full sized SD cards--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07ZKRM12C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_VYKCAADQWBETHN337JG1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

  I've only had this laptop for a few days so I am writing a review accordingly. So to start off, I'm not a huge tech person at all. I have a smart  Phone and have done everything from that period the last time that I had a laptop was probably  about 7 years ago.I recently started a business where I will be shipping products and printing invoices and  things of that nature. I knew I would either need a laptop or a desktop to do so. I figured a laptop would be perfect for now since its portable and I can take it anywhere.I initially ordered a chromebook off of Walmart.com and was so disappointed.  The screen and picture was so dim that it hurted my eyes. There was no way to adjust brightness.  There was no cap lock button and several other disturbing things...lol it went back the next day.Came to Amazon and saw this beautiful red hp laptop.  Took a chance and so far I'm loving it. Again,  I'm not a super tech gal or anything like that so I can't tell you how storage and all the specs will work. I like this laptop because it's semi huge. I'm a female with big hands and the keyboard is perfect for me.The Chromebook I sent back would load web pages super slow even when sitting right next to my modem.  As for this hp laptop, I'm out on my back porch and modem is upstairs and it's still loading with n0 problem at all.I wasn't quite sure what S mode was when I ordered it but it took 2 minutes to get it out of S mode. I went to gmail.com to check my emails and a message from gmail popped up in the right hand corner that said you are not using a Google browser and click her to get Google browser.  That's it that's all and my laptop is out of S mode.I have used it to create several word documents for my website so far.  Hooked up perfectly to my printer. Beautiful Color!! Keyboard is not backlight but its really nice so who cares. So far so good. Also shipping was really fast.  It was due on Wednesday but got her on Monday.

  My husband only likes HP computers. He had been wanting a laptop that he could use to pay bills, watch some youtube videos and surf the internet and not have to use his phone.I order this for him for Father's Day. It came in S mode but that was super easy to remove. The color is nice and its a nice size for viewing videos.

  I needed a notebook type laptop with built-in camera and audio to conduct meetings on Zoom, stream Netflix, surf/ browse the internet, compose Microsoft documents (I purchased and installed my own Microsoft office 2019)..... In other words nothing heavy duty/schmancy. Have had it a few weeks, is performing very well, good battery life lightweight and thin. Good screen quality/ resolution. It would be nice if the keyboard was backlit, but it's not.....

  It has been just over a month since I got it. For what I do, email, read articles, shop, play poker, this is a great machine. It came within a reasonable time. My only complaint is that it comes with Windows 10 S. It says it comes with Windows 10 (check the chart), but it was in the S mode. It seemed simple to remove or shut off but it would not and after repeated attempts and some foul language at the Microsoft site, I appealed to their Community and went to bed. The second response the next day solved the issue and after following the prompts I was able to get it out of S mode. Props to the Microsoft Community. Now I can add any App (hello Chrome, bye Edge) I want regardless of Microsoft's feelings. If the chart had been correct or this had come without the S Mode this would be a 5-star review.It is thin and has a large screen. It has a louder volume from the speakers than my older HP Pavillion. That is a good thing as the last one was not loud enough. It is also lighter than my last one and the battery lasts about 4x as long. If there is a fan I can not hear it, but there seems to be very little heat.  So far so good.

  Worse experience ever for two reasons..I was willing to pay for 2 day shipping and handling to get a laptop as quickly as possible..what I didnt realize is two day doesnt mean two days in seller and Amazon equation..mailed on 7/30 didnt receive until Aug 4th..open it up..doesnt work..hp support thinks it is adaptor or board itself..Never again..

  I bought this Dell laptop, and the day it arrived, the screen illumination dimmer stopped working, but only after I had dimmed it all the way down!  Then while was working, I saw an announcement that said something like, ""This computer is experiencing a problem,"" and it suddenly and without warning began a reboot!  Imagine if I had been on a Zoom call with a client!  Lastly, I decided to send the laptop back, and I've learned the seller charges a 10% restocking fee, and Amazon requires postage for the return (on a Prime item, nonetheless)!

  I am not interested in gaming or streaming movies, so I can't help with an opinion on those activities.  I am more into utilitarian things like internet access, spreadsheets, word processing and database.  Most of that comes along iwth MS 365, though I don't know if Access is included since I already had that in my subscription. Anyway, this computer came in good shape and a few days before promised and was all I expected.  Definitely acceptable and I'd recommend it for the sort of purposes I know about.

  This vendor (PCOnline365) had a laptop configuration that was what I wanted and at a price that was reasonable.  I bought it.  The process was easy and I was able to get it in a short time (not PRIME eligible).  I especially like not having it loaded with programs and applications I didn't want.  Their follow-up was polite and appropriate.  In the areas that matter - they exceeded expectations.  Recommended for your needs.

  Great overall.  This laptop is lightweight and slim, easy to travel with. Processor and memory are good and haven't seen any slowness in operation or applications.  Haven't noticed any overheating. Battery lasts, of course dependant of screen brightness and use. No problems so far.  Luckily, for the future, dell laptops are easy to work on if and when replacement parts are needed.  Will be planning on replacing the 1tb hd with a 1tb ssd.

  Loads Windows 10 (s-mode) quickly , about 25 seconds. Set screen brightness at 75% and tilt slightly back a little further than normal to correct washed out appearance. Battery life is running at about 7 hrs. with intermittent use. I did shut down all unnecessary apps from running in the background in the settings. I'm not a fan of Windows 10 s-mode which limits the user to apps from the Microsoft Store. You can switch to win. 10 home for free which does not require this limitation, however I have a 250 gb ssd in my unit so I have not switched and I'm trying to work with  the S-mode, I may switch sometime in the future. I do recommend this laptop for general use around the home, my only complaint is that the graphics could be better., Ok I used this laptop for about 2 more weeks and I would add that I have switched it out of the Windows 10 s-mode without any problems. There was no significant issue or change to the amount of used space on the 250 gb hard drive and it is operating normally in the Win 10 standard (home) mode which is a free switch so it will now accept apps from outside the windows store.

  My old 2012 ThinkPad, that I used for a few things to keep those things off my newer computer, finally died. I selected this Ideapad as a reasonable option for those uses.As most people know, ThinkPads have the best keyboard in the business. This machine can't meet that standard, but it is pretty good for a laptop. I'm a fast touch typists and I got along with it.The screen looks good but is only 1366x768 which isn't very inspiring for a 15 inch screen. This machine is not meant for gaming or high class photo and video editing!One very nice feature that many computer makers don't provide: The top row of keys has shifted options for various features of the computer. This machine, like most competitors comes set so the those extra options are not shifted. You have to press Fn+F key to get a function key to work. Not very good for people who know Windows short cut keys or who have software that regularly uses function keys. Fortunately this machine has an option in the BIOS to restore the keys to the proper function. I almost never use those extra key features but routinely use the actual function keys, so this makes the computer much more pleasant to use.In comparison to the old ThinkPad which I had downgraded to 4gig of ram and an old 360 gig HD, this machine is blazing fast with 12 gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD. It is also very slim and light so it is much easier to carry. However I was surprised it didn't charge via USB and the power brick has fixed prongs, not folding prongs. That is a minor complaint but still surprising. I haven't used it long enough to test the battery life.Big warning: This machine comes with Windows 10S which I thought I heard had been withdrawn by MS? If you don't want to be limited to using only apps from the Windows Store, be sure to Google how to switch from 10S back to Windows Home. I would have returned this machine if I couldn't switch back to real Windows 10.Also, if you prefer using local accounts on the machine, rather than a Microsoft Account, be sure to ignore the option to link to WiFi during the setup. Only if it doesn't have a network connection will it allow you to set up a local account. You can always connect to WiFi after finishing the setup.

  After spending a couple hours on initial setup, I attempted to install my primary software, and discovered that this machine came with Windows in S mode. Say what?  I had specifically bought this particular model over some other choices because it did NOT say it was coming with Windows S mode. So I figured, ok, no big deal. Switching out of S mode is supposed to be fairly simple. I follow the instructions on Microsoft's site, and it directs me to the Windows Store to get the ""Switch out of S mode"" app. Weird, but okay...So I try to ""get"" the app, and instead all I see is a vague error saying ""something happened and we couldn't start the upgrade"". Lovely.I tried for the next few hours everything I could find online to fix it, but with no progress.I called Lenovo, who basically told me to pound sand, unless I wanted to pay them for ""premium software support"". Oh no, I'm not paying you to get my brand new laptop working!I finally got on the phone with Microsoft directly, and spoke with a nice lady who was able to remote into the machine (using Quick Assist), and verify the error.After trying everything she knew (including setting up a new user account with a Microsoft account auto-login), she finally gave up and we performed a clean install of Windows 10 Home, using a custom config file she helped me inject into the iso file I downloaded from MS servers.So now my machine is finally up and running regular Windows 10 Home, version 20H2, without all the Lenovo bloatware.All-in-all, this was a truly painful process, and a complete waste of time. This machine never should have come with the pointless S mode enabled to begin with. I blame Lenovo for that, since I have 2 other Lenovo laptops (an S340 and another Ideapad 3), both bought within the past 6 months, and neither of them came in S mode.

  Negative- The battery lasts an only an hour even when in battery saving mode.  I'm constantly having to plug in.  Camera quality is very poor, looks extremely grainy and dark in virtual meetings.  Graphics are not great. Poor ventilation.Positive- touchscreen works properly, plenty of memory, good processor; moves pretty fast.  Overall, for the price I paid I am satisfied. I was not concerned about graphics when I purchase but disappointed mainly in the battery life.

  After my previous chromebook died, I was in a bit of a pinch to find something decently powerful with at least 4 cpu threads and 64gb of storage.this machine was the best value I could find at $250~. running chrome apps, the thing is quite snappy and responds well.6-8gb of RAM and a higher resolution screen would be my only two asks to make this into the perfect machine. other than these items, the computer does everything I need.I can run Steam Remote Play to play games from my desktop (little to no lag), with linux (beta) enabled, you can install flatpak and the flathub repo and use all the flatpaks you want. Most flatpaks work without issues, however some may be a bit buggy.Running AppImages also works fine, you just have to start them using the terminal emulator vs double clicking on them. (note you have to run chmod a+x to allow them to run).Running the Ultimaker Cura AppImage works well enough, but this doesnt quite have enough power to make it run the smoothest. Despite this, it will certainly get the job don if you are mildly patient and dont get click happy.Huge plus of this device is that the usb c ports are 3.1 and displayport 2.1. with the displayport 2.1 ports allow you to use a USB C docking station like the ""HP USB-C Dock G4"" docking station will allow you to use up to 3 displays (including the chromebook's built in display) at the same time.I did test this with a Dell WD19 docking station and can report that it will not output a display signal with that docking station despite all of the other functions of the docking station working.TL;DR not sure how I would have done better on short notice with similar money. I highly recommend this product if you are in the ""sub $300 - $350 chromebook"" price range.

  Took a very long time for the Google and security software to update. Was about to give up but then it magically completed the process and now this chromebook works very well. Keyboard is a little on the cheap side but for the price it is perfect for my son's remote learning. I have been able to load a couple of security related extensions to monitor my son's usage where the school computer would not allow me to do. Battery life appears to be as advertised. This chromebook serves its purpose.

  This computer is a renewed product, but I would never have guessed by looking at it or using it.  It arrived packaged as if it were brand-new.  It looks and operates as well as a new computer as well.  It charges fine and holds a charge too.  I have had it for a week and only charged it once.

  Chromebooks are great for daily tasks on a budget. Choosing a refurbished product makes it an even better deal. I got this for my mother in law who needs to check email, watch some online videos, and play spider solitaire.

  This was a great price for a refurbished device.I will say that it does exactly what I expected it to do.

  ive seen people say that the battery life isn't good, but I don't think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on, youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop. the picture quality is ecxcellent. the specs overall are great for under 1k. its upgradable. it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd.ive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on. ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO. with no use, the light goes off. all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they'll come back on. im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked.

I like the thin, sleeker design. The battery is pretty good depending on what you’re doing and the light up keyboard allows me to see what I’m doing even in dimly lit rooms. I’ve had no issues whatsoever with it. Very happy I bought this laptop

  This has been a great computer, plays everything that I've thrown at it, not at top specs but more then enough for me.  Thermal control is better then expected, it can be a little loud but nothing near my last asus ROG machine.  I upgraded to 16GB ram and windows ran better but didn't notice a ton in games.Pros:-Bang for your buck-USB-C-easy to upgrade-Looks like a gaming laptop without being obnoxious-Power brick is really compact for this type of computerCons:-The middle hinge is a little scary, you have to open it from the middle.  If you open it with the corners it flexes the screen a lot.-Wish the power button was on the side so I don't have to open it when it's plugged into my monitor-Battery life is good for a gaming laptop but realistically 3-4 hours of normal use.  1-2 hours of gaming maybe.-USB-C isn't thunderbolt

  So as you all know, earlier this year I bought the HP Pavilion Gaming 15 core i5-8300H and had a hiccup that was resolved if you read my review on that one.  This time I bought the newer core i5-9300H model for a friend and I must say I love this new design.  It has larger vents for better air flow; 2 settings for the light in the keyboard (dim and bright green); the monitor is a bit more sturdy then the first which is a plus.  Overall this machine is definitely a 5 out of 5 for the price bracket.

  Pretty good, for those that are wondering. When I received this laptop, it only arrived with an M.2. No sata. Housing for the sata, but no sata only a blank box so the housing could mount. Still a solid computer, good for gaming and strong fans. Easy maintenance, thermal pads and paste are easily accessible. All though this was bought at walmart and everyone including these people have upped the price, but still a solid computer for the extra $200+ they slapped on it. This is an hp originally sold at walmart for around 545 dollars. Hope this review is helpful, enjoy the laptop.

  Aspire 5, Ryzen 3, Vega 3 Graphics, 16GB RAM DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD:On mine, the upgraded boot SSD came as a Kingston and the memory modules were Crucial brand. I was happy to see brand names that I recognized.I installed an expansion 1GB WD Blue SSD myself and am extremely happy with this little PC. The boot SSD does indeed run at NVMe speeds, 1646/929 MB/s sequential read/write. The WD Blue SSD that I installed runs 392/303 MB/s. I am pretty sure that the motherboard is the limiting factor on these speeds.The Windows 10 Task Manager shows the GPU as having reserved 2GB of RAM and is sharing 7GB Ram with the system. That seems reasonable to me.You can just buy the base model Aspire 5 and add all of this stuff yourself, saving some serious $. I had already upgraded the boot NVMe SSD on a different PC and just did not want to deal with that again, too many headaches for me getting Windows 10 uefi BIOS set up. The RAM and additional SSD are fairly simple DIY projects. This was a good purchase for me.

  I have zero negatives about this laptop or seller. As everyone does I researched the hell out of laptops before I made my purchase. The best recommended product was this exact Acer laptop & Thrilled it was selling on Amazon, MY FAV!I also made certain to read as many reviews as possible here on Amazon before putting my money down. I have never been happier purchasing a laptop. It came earlier than scheduled & packaged like new so I am giving high marks to the seller!It was larger than the company laptop I was working on but thinner & lighter, Yeah! The set up took less than 20 minutes & I have been loving it ever since. I highly recommend this laptop even if you have a large budget to spend.I did spend the extra money to get the warranty but did not purchase any of the additions they recommend, ie office, adobe, etc. Since I read the reviews & saw how many people were unhappy with them I chose not to purchase & happy I didn't. I have not needed any additions, my Acer has everything I need already built in.

  We bought 2 of these with the 16gb and 512 ssd for school and work. This laptop doesn’t disappoint it’s quick and responds  very quickly. The only thing is one laptop says it has Alexa built in which I can’t find and the other one doesn’t say anything.

  this computer is expensive to get the bigger hard drive 1TB. and it comes loaded with old software from2014 mostly and is STUCK in Windows ""S MODE"". sure there are ways that are SUPPOSED to remove it but they dont work - so you are stuck with lots and lots of Microsoft pop=ups constantly trying to sell you things thru Microsift Store AND bombarding your email which you must provide to activate Windows at all.  S MODE allows you opnly to add apps that are sold and ""approved"" by Microsoft. I've been thru all of their help garbage, talked to them and Acer, but still stuck in S Mode. its crap. its annoying. I'm not paying Microsoft for every little thing I may want to add to this computer- It doesnt even let you run Microsoft Office with paying for an additional upgrade.  almost $700 to have my privacy constantly invaded and my every movement tracked. ridiculous. stay with your old laptop and just upgrade the hard drive and save yourself 100's of dollars.

  The other reviews do not understate the quality of the webcam - it is horrendous. Much lesser of quality than I would expect for a $1600 2020 laptop.Love the keyboard. I'm a mechanical-keyboard type of person, and while I typically hate low-profiles, I liked the keyboard on this laptop enough that it was the decision-making factor when it came down to a few options. Handles smaller games great, professional looking and would recommend to anyone using it for non-webcam related purposes.Update: Some serious graphical glitches came with this laptop. It's behaving like motherboard failure. Seems like this is a problem with XPS's in general. Returning and not chancing it - I suspected the laptop was a return to begin with, and the packaging was pretty badly damaged when it came (previously ripped open multiple times). I still like the laptop, but I'm replacing it with a unit from the manufacturer.

  I received an open box product. It struggled to function with a wireless mouse and keyboard combo via USB hub.  Several times it crashed if I unplugged it and closed the lid.  Also, recently the fingerprint reader and IR camera for face recognition are no longer recognized.  too many issues in the first two weeks to keep.  However, i am very happy with the laptop as a whole and will be ordering from Dell.  I am sorry that Amazon would send an open box of an obviously defective product to a long-time consumer, especially at this price point.Sorry to return. I saw several other reviews about open items.

  I’m not too keen on this. It’s the same computer as the one I bought in 2017 except it’s different. One thing I loathe is that I needed to buy a dongle so I could hook up my monitor, my keyboard, and my mouse. Didn’t have to on the other one. The fingerprint reader is finicky, which is annoying because I keep logging in and getting that error message, but my biggest issue is the keyboard. Idk what they did with it, but it’s not chiclet style like the older model it’s almost too flat for my preference it feels like I’m going to break the keys. And the hinge feels subpar kind of cheap. Just not happy that I paid all the money for this.

  Purchased fully loaded, Dell XPS 13 (11th gen).  Everything as expected EXCEPT the micro SD slot does not allow the micro SD card to eject.  After researching on the web, this has been reported to Dell as a problem on the XPS 13 (9300 series) as early as 2019;  obviously still a problem.Updated 5-May-21:  Never Dell again.  Sent to Dell for repair, Dell said that, as the microSD port on the Motherboard was damaged, and as not covered by BASIC warranty, I had to pay 259 plus tax to get repaired.  I am having them return the laptop, and am investigating how to return to Amazon as ""received as damaged"".

  The good: I like the back lit keyboard, the fast, quiet solid state memory, the long battery life, the big 15.6 screen.  Used as a simple school or business tool it is a perfectly good computer.The not great: The 4gb ram is a limiting factor on this unit.  You cannot ever install additional ram to handle modern software or games, as it has no slots for ram at all. The 4gb ram is simply soldered in to the unit.Be aware of this when making this purchase.On the plus side, You can easily greatly expand on the 128gb solid drive by plugging in an internal m.2 SSD card.  An empty m.2 slot is provided. The speed of this computer is only slow when used for multi tasking with intense business software. Regular use is fine, in fact its pretty snappy with good performance. I did have to disable the windows 10 S mode. Disabling 10S is a built in option, allowing a return to regular windows. 10s would not function with the business software and non microsoft add ons I require. I am now running regular windows 10 with no issues.

   The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you're using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. I'm evaluating my replacement options right now but it seems it's hard to get an unit without this or worse issues.Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works.Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue.Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is really bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google: ""flex to click xps 9500""). BTW the technician visit on update2 was never scheduled and the ETA was moved up twice. If you're picky with touchpads or quality of your purchases don't buy this model.

  I love everything about this laptop except for the webcam; it is embarrassingly bad. Like...really REALLY bad. A brand new premium laptop in 2020 should have a webcam that at least looks sorta close to 2020 technology. In a world where Zoom calls are the new norm, this webcam simply doesn't cut it.

  This laptop is fantastic, and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  But let's talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: ""Is this a new product?"".  Given the $2000 price tag, it's only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving.  I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself.For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before.  With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival.  The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place.Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from ""Dell Returns"" located in Lebanon, Tennessee.  So I did some quick investigating.  I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee.  These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns.  Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these ""new unused"" products at a cheaper price tag.  So yes, I believe this product is ""NEW"", but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards.  This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of.For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon.  Now, considering all of these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL!  You are getting Dell's UHD+ touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro.  If you were buying this same laptop configuration off of Dell's official website, it run you close to ~$2500.  On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on a Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly.  The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel.  The display is gorgeous and crisp.  The touchscreen is super responsive.  The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop.  I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having.Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning pretty hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings.  Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks.  I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender.  And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is definitely a fingerprint magnet lol.All in all, this laptop is absolutely stunning.  The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out.

  I was a little nervous reading reviews that stated that computers come used, not working etc. I can confirm that Amazon delivered to me a pristine machine - working perfectly, is new and exactly to the spec Amazon advertised. Very happy with the purchase. I purchased UHD+ Touchscreen 10th gen i7 - the screen is perfect, on par or better than new MacBook Pro that I also use. Overall new XPS 15 is well designed, solid machine with fast processor and outstanding UHD+ screen. I also like that I can upgrade it to 64GB or RAM for about $300 (2933MHz DDR4 CL17 SODIMM Laptop Memory).P.S. For non technical people, please run both Dell updater (lots of drivers / bios updates there) and Windows updates.

  I had a chromebook for a couple of years because it was cheap.  When I finally got tired of the limitations of that laptop I started searching on-line for the best reasonably priced computer.  I looked at all the big name models  with touch screen and without.  My wife had an ASUS for several years and I was impressed with the features.  When I saw this one with a 17 inch screen, solid state storage, fast processor and windows 10 not 10S I jumped on it.  I bought it for less than $500.  Can't beat that.  Couldn't get a better one cheaper at Costco.

  In the past two months I have purchased and returned a Lenovo (highest volume was maybe HALF of any other computer I've had and boot up was incredibly slow); an HP (despite reload of Windows10 with HP tech giving instructions by phone, still couldn't get laptop to recognize internal DVD drive and I bought it to load music on to) and now I have come to the conclusion I need to return this ASUS.

I think it has to do with the auto updates. It freezes for as long as 5 minutes and Ctrl/Alt/Del does not work. Maybe I should call ASUS support but I'm so disheartened, I may not waste my time. If something brand new doesn't work properly, do you want to fix it or do you want something that is perfect right out of the box? I returned the Lenovo to Office Depot up the street. I had to pay $40 to return the HP to an Amazon seller who did not provide for free returns. This one was purchased from Amazon so I am hopeful the return will be free.I bought this laptop because I wanted the largest possible screen (17.3) for my heavy-use streaming (Hulu, Netflix, Prime, HBO, etc.). I also wanted to finally load all my music on one of my computers and it might as well be the newest one. This one is going back but here's how I would rate it:Pros: the screen is large enough for good viewing, the color and clarity are sharp and the volume is great. It boots up quickly and I like the large keyboard buttons. I like that the weight is moderate and not too heavy. The appearance is okay, although I like the look of my old (2013) red ASUS better. My old ASUS had TERRIBLE wireless connectivity and I was happy to find this one had no connectivity issues.Cons: I HATE Windows10 and I believe the issues with this computer are due to the OS and not the equipment itself, but I am not a tech expert and I don't care WHY the problem is, I only want a working and reliable laptop with a 17-inch screen. So here I go back to shopping. Don't know if I'll stick with ASUS or try a fourth brand since, apparently, getting a good product has more to do with luck than with brand name or reputation.

  Computer boots fast and operates quickly. Those are pluses. The big negative for me is the battery life. I have had the computer for just about two weeks, and the longest it has stayed on with a full battery is 90 minutes. That's inconvenient when I am in a meeting that lasts more than that time.

  Seems great, everything installed correctly and booted up normally. Bought this laptop for my father who is going to be using it for work after having back surgery.Laptop is nice in size, but the reason I rated it only 2 stars is because there is a mark on the top side of the laptop which makes me believe this is a used model? I’ve never purchased a tech item that is scratched before, and the listing showed new.Pretty disappointed and cannot return due to this taking almost a week to get to me and he needs it for work. Next time I will look somewhere else for a laptop.

  Product description says this has backlighting for the keyboard; it does not. The lettering is difficult-to-impossible to read in any kind of lighting. Looking at the keyboard it is easy to believe it was INTENDED to have backlighting in the original design but someone forgot to include it in the construction. To 'see' the letters, I had to shine a flashlight at an angle to the keyboard. Tech support responded this was not a glitch, the computer doesn't have it. Can't say much about other features as this was a deal-breaker, and I re-boxed it shortly after starting it.

  I needed a laptop with an i7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and 500 GB storage for my Master's in Business Analytics program. Most other laptops that meet these requirements cost $1,200 - $2,000. This laptop is very smooth, and is easy to use and customize. 10/10 would recommend for business and daily use. This is the best use of $900 I have spent.

  I've had this laptop for a couple months now. Here are my pros/cons, especially where the laptop differs from my expectations. Overall I'd definitely recommend this laptop to people, though.The screen is great. I love the full HD 1920x1080 resolution. At 15"" that's a bit dense, and if your eyes are getting old you may find things too small. But it's a beautiful screen overall! Bright, high contrast, sharp.The solid state drive and lots of RAM make this very fast. I can't believe how fast it boots.The power button feels flimsy. This button is not going to last 10 years if I'm pressing it every day. Mostly I put it in ""sleep"" mode when not using it, and can wake it with any key on the keyboard. I end up using the actual power button maybe once every week or two, so hopefully that makes it last longer.Sometimes when I put it in ""sleep"" mode, it wakes up on its own. I don't understand why. It's probably some setting somewhere. I did discover that the external USB mouse I had attached was automatically configured to be a device that can wake the laptop from sleep, if the mouse moves. I disabled that, and that reduced how often the laptop wakes up on its own, but didn't entirely eliminate it.The keyboard is generous, for a laptop. It even has the 10-key on the right side. Some of the key placements are not what I'm used to, but laptop keyboards always make compromises. And the keys are very comfortable. The function keys (F1-F12 across the top) default to a *different* use (e.g., bright/dim the screen, volume up/down, etc.) and to use them for traditional F1-F12 functions (e.g., F2 = rename, F5 = refresh, etc.) you have to hold down a new ""Fn"" key down by Ctrl/Shift/Alt. I find this unfortunate because 9 times out of 10 I want the F1-F12 functions, not the others.The laptop has 4 rubberized feet on the bottom. However, when you flip up the screen, the hinge extends downward and actually lifts the laptop up off its back two rubberized feet. This is obviously by design, but wow that's a weird design. The laptop spends most of its time sitting on the hinge in the back, and the front two rubberized feet.Only two USB ports is a bit of a disappointment. I immediately bought two Sabrent 4-port USB hubs, one for each laptop port. Now I'm good to go at home, and when on travel I rarely need even the two built-in ports. Having USB-3 speeds is sure nice if you have external hard drives or other devices that can handle it!Only one HDMI port (and no other external monitor port) makes it hard to have this laptop drive two big monitors. I had to end up with one external monitor plus the built-in screen, which I don't like because they are such different sizes. There are external USB-C ""docking"" stations that solve this, but I have not tried one.

  First laptop I've bought and I must say I'm very disappointed. I bought it because of the Specs yet it doesn't perform much different from a $300 laptop. It froze completely on the 1st day just playin a game called League Of Legends for those who don't know its not even a game that requires much power to run yet it has happened several times(I have videos). Now overall the laptop lags from time to time specially when I plug in the charger which on top of it the battery is not that great but I could live with that. The Laptop is updated I have good internet and I've only had it for like 2 weeks now. Build quality is nice but that's about the best thing about it, for the cost it falls short on every other aspect. I'll look for options when it comes to returns cause I'm definitely not satisfied.

  I really wanted to love this laptop, as the specs for the price are a great value. However, the fan is very loud and it wouldn’t stop running... and it was brand new! I called HP and they suggested that I ship the laptop to them and I would get it back in 2-3 weeks. Who can be without a computer for that long nowadays? Not me! Anyway, I returned it. :( Still shopping for a new laptop now.

  MAJOR SCREEN ISSUES, see other reviews.  Touchpad is comparable to popping the bubble in the board game “Trouble”.  Extremely unresponsive (have to press hard to register a click) and inconsistent (clicking in the same spot will register a click one minute, nothing the next).  Screen is very dark after setting all possible brightness to maximum.  Very dark when placed side by side with my 3 year old HP.  Simple game with no lag on 3 yr old HP lags on this one.  If you don’t use Microsoft email the email interface is the most basic I have ever seen, you are better off going to through the browser.  The keyboard layout is very awkward; they shifted everything left and off center in order to add a number pad on the right (there are still numbers above the letters.  Before you buy, line you hands up centered, at a normal laptop, then slide them 3 keys to the left and see how that feels.  Mid-range price wise but serious design/usability issues.

  Good performance.  Annoying HP bloatware.  Bought to do video editing and it excels at that.  Fast boot.  Decent keyboard.  Paired with blutooth Logitech M585 mouse that works well (only 2 regular USB ports).  My main complaint is the misleading USB-C port.  Yes it will connect and charge my cell phone,  but any $3 hardware store adapter could do that!  I bought a USC-C to HDMI cable to support a 3rd monitor... worthless...NO display thru USC-C, just data or charging.  I have bought HP for decades but this is just ""made in China"" mediocre crud that I  wouldn't have purchased had I  known. Last test will be to connect to 4k/3820dpi monitor thru HDMI port.  If it can't do that,  it will be Ebay ""dump it"" computer.  There is no DVD player/ recorder but they are  $25 at Walmart for LG / USB unit that worked well.  Windows 10 has no software to play a DVD  movie so hunt for that.  Price?  3x price any laptop I ever bought as I like desktops for a REAL computer. Fast enough.  Hope it lasts. Apparently laptops are in short supply this year... this is better than most but it's still a compromise.

  Set it up initially and went through Windows update to make sure I had the latest versions of everything. After about two weeks, Win 10 would say the Bluetooth  hardware was not installed even though it had been working properly.  Tried reloading drivers through Win 10, but it said I had the latest drivers. Eventually tried the Dell support site and downloaded their SupportAssist. It loaded different drivers than the Win 10 ones and that fixed my problem.  Don't understand why the laptop didn't come from Dell with the correct drivers. Also would have saved me a lot of time if the SupportAssist was already on the laptop and available to use.

  Love this laptop.  Had a 8 to 10 year old Dell and when I got this new one I was prepared to take some time to adapt.  Not at all!  Only a few things gave me pause, but overall I went straight into using it as if I had had it for years.  I am 7over 70 so it was a very welcome experience.  I love this laptop and with the addition of a separate disc drive, it is perfect.  It is much lighter than my old one, too which is a big plus. The display is great, and since I do a lot of Zoom, I appreciate the camera quality and the sound.  The storage size is much greater than I will ver use, and since it was such a small increase over the smaller storage, I was really happy to be able to afford it.

  This has been the absolute worst buying experience that I’ve had in years. I order this on July 27th and it arrives in a timely fashion on the 29th. After three hours of the mildest use possible (loading programs, etc - getting it ready for an editing job), it is dead. Simply plugging the power supply into the laptop will shunt the power supply, forcing the power supply itself to shut down.Dell was and has been utterly useless to talk to. Amazon has been running me around in some recursive “support” loop for 13 hours now. I’ve offered at least five times to hand deliver this defective laptop to the Amazon facility that shipped it, in return for a new non-defective unit. “Support” has been all but supportive. I am going to lose this job over this.If this problem isn’t rectified by the morning of August 4th, I’m going to dispute the charges against my card and let Amazon and Dell bicker over who will come and get this expensive doorstop.

  Update: Returned the laptop. Would constantly overheat and shut off within 15 minutes of moderate gaming. Can't call this a good gaming laptop if the laptop can't property handle the hardware.This laptop has quite an impressive spec sheet for the price, but with some issues within an hour of unboxing, I'm not sure if the laptop will last.The laptop came out of the box without WiFi drivers, so I had to run to the store and grab an ethernet cable to finish setting it up online. After a few programs and Windows updates installed, I restarted the PC and got a Bitlocker recovery screen requiring me to input the key. I thought ""Okay, good thing I went online and signed in with my MS account"" and got all that fixed.After installing two more programs (MS Office and Notepad++), I restarted my PC and got an light error code (power light blinked 7 times white, 2 times amber) and looked it up online, which told me it was some LCD screen failure. After about 15 minutes of just letting it sit there thinking of what I'd have to do, it started up fine and is working without any further issues now. I have no idea how it fixed itself, but somewhere in those 15 minutes it figured out how to turn itself back on I guess.I've had a number of issues in the first 4 hours of having it today, and am a bit afraid of it just not turning on some day with how it's going so far. I'd say it's a good price, but the hardware/software is abnormally horrible for a new PC.  Only other grievance I've noticed so far is how hot it can get on the bottom of the PC. I know it has a dedicated graphics card in it, but coming from my previous PC (the Dell Inspiron 15 5000 5577), it never got too hot to touch & was very quiet.

  It's taken me a week or so to fully digest the functionality and pros/cons of this laptop. Overall, if you read the product description (and know anything about electronics) it's pretty straight forward what you're getting. That being said, I feel it's important to outline a few cool features as well as drawbacks you may overlook.Initial Impression: Materially, this is a really solid piece of equipment. Though somewhat heavier than I expected, this is typical with a gaming laptop. The power adapter is massive however, and unnecessarily so. I don't know if this has anything to do with requiring more energy for intense gaming, but it's literally a quarter the size of the laptop itself. The keys are backlit (which can be turned on and off with the press of a button), and there are ports for virtually everything you could imagine. The screen itself is somewhat of a matte texture which is something I'm not used to, but after a few hours of use I appreciated how it prevents glare. As with most laptops, the brightness is adjustable on the keyboard - something to take into consideration when trying to preserve battery life. That being said, startup was a nightmare... but this was due largely in part to my internet being down - an essential requirement to get up and running. I'm very much a ""plug and play"" kind of guy, so you can imagine my frustration when the computer repeatedly froze on a black screen until I was able to get online to download essential updates and software components (all of which should be pre-installed for a device this new). Trying to add a secondary user was equally frustrating as it also needed to re-download many of the same components as my setup, once again freezing repeatedly. Once past all the initial turmoil, everything was a breeze.Extended use: After a full charge, the battery lasted roughly 2.5-3 hours while I browsed the internet and worked on documents. With streaming and game play, the battery life is surprisingly close to the same (roughly 2 hours depending how much multi-tasking you're doing). The dual fan system is incredibly quiet and kept the laptop from heating more than say your average smartphone after prolonged use.Cortana is your virtual assistant (similar to Siri). While she is accessible from your desktop, you can also enable ""Hey Cortana"" in the settings which will allow her to respond to voice commands.Link your phone using the edge app. This allows you to sync browsing history, favorites, and alternate seamlessly between devices (simply by logging into your Microsoft account). It is worth noting the functionality for Apple products is more limited than Android (which allows you to see/sync SMS, MMS, pictures, and video). I have an iPhone, so I cannot personally attest to whether or not the additional Android features actually work, but the information showed up while setting up my device.Game Shift, a function controlled by a button on your keyboard, is said to increase the fan speed to cool the processor, and prioritizes game data over annoying popups or background apps (and updates). Basically, it is supposed to optimize the resources needed during gaming (processor, video card, memory, etc). I attempted to test this function with several games and did not notice a difference or receive the on-screen prompt that it was working. Perhaps I need to update a driver for this? It wouldn't surprise me given the number of essentials I had to install during setup. That being said, the gaming I did was pretty seamless and ran without issues.It's worth mentioning there is no CD/DVD drive. I completely overlooked this prior to ordering, and the vast majority of my software is on discs. This is easily resolvable with an external drive which costs virtually nothing nowadays.The webcam has an indicator light next to it to ensure privacy (so you know when it's on). The resolution is average, but consistent with other laptop cams on the market.Lastly, a few quick notes. As an avid gamer and video editor, I will say one thing I found discouraging is the computer's memory. Though this is something easily resolved with an external drive, all of these ""plug in"" devices begin to defeat the purpose and simplicity of a laptop. Additionally, the included manual indicates a fingerprint reader on/by the power button... this is NOT a standard feature with all G3 models.Summary: When utilized for office use (or basic functionality) this laptop is superior in terms of speed and software capabilities. For standard gaming it's average, and for the professional gamer it might be underwhelming in some of the areas outlined above. Still, when put to the test it's a reliable laptop that I'd consider a nice addition to Dell's product line.

  I've had the laptop for about a week know and it's been working great. The screen is really good, my previous laptop had a 60hz screen and the difference is definitely noticeable, if it were a bit brighter it'd be perfect.  I've mostly been playing borderlands 3 on it, running the visuals on high. The game runs smoothly, the only catch is that the laptop gets pretty warm. So if you're planning on gaming with this machine I'd definitely recommend a laptop stand.

  Best laptop I have owned.  A lot of tech for the money.  Runs smoothly no matter the task.  Games like Microsoft Flight Sim and Halo run great.  I don’t find that it gets too hot.  Fans spin up, but that is expected.  Beautiful screen.  I had low expectations here, so surprised. Movies look amazing.  Very user upgradable.  I added a second HD (1 TB).  I upgraded to 32G RAM.  Super easy.  Battery life is just ok, but didn’t expect too much from a gaming laptop.  Keyboard and backlight is nice.  Dell software for updates and maintenance is a nice plus.  Alien Software also a nice surprise,.  Laptop is nice just for web browsing, personal/business work and when want to play games it performs.  Highly recommended.  I like the design.  Plenty of ports and I find they are well placed.

  Got this for my wife since she needed a new laptop BADLY, and was starting a new job where she wouldnt have her work laptop for about a month after her start date. This machine is plenty fast, the screen is very good quality and the laptop is thin and light. Everything you would need in a laptop you need for work or travel. My wife absolutely loves the laptop and being the tech nerd husband, I was the one who picked out the options based on specs and she picked out the style/color/size and everything else about it. The Ryzen 7 4700u is the best ultrabook low powered processor on the market, 8 cores 8 threads, and with 16gb of RAM your ready to go in handling all of the normal tasks youd need to with ease. I especially recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a powerful machine, but likes the lightweight and small size convenience to be able to take it with you when traveling no problem.

  It's taking some time getting use to it, since I had a15.6"".  I'm use to having the numbers on the right side of keyboard, big adjustment. Dislike the type c charging cable since it has a round point power port. Have no use for the HDMI port.  Wish it had a Ethernet port instead. Only 2 USB ports, I bet the cable mfg love it selling adapters and docking ports, and adapters. I don't use it for games, and haven't tried touch screen. Over all I like the unit beats the old HHD.

  Really great little laptop. My son wanted a smaller laptop he could flip and write on for engineering. He uses it with an additional portable monitor and it has all the power be needs for all his projects.

  I bought this laptop so I could work at places other than my office. My more device-savvy kid picked the laptop and the specs, so if you’re looking for a technical review, this isn’t it. I’m running Office in whatever version they’re calling it these days. 365? My bread & butter is running QuickBooks Desktop (QBDT) and that program can be a bit of a resource hog. My new ThinPad has handled it beautifully. I liked that I could add the Lenovo app and customize my settings even more than what windows offers. This laptop is super light and thin - she’s practically a supermodel. I love that I can toggle a slide and a red dot shows me the camera is closed. The slide is a little hard to see because it’s black in black so I took a metallic silver sharpie and marked it. Problem solved. I like the feel of the 10-key, but I have smaller hands. Someone with larger hands might not find it roomy enough. The matte surface is pretty, but it definitely shows fingerprints. I was cleaning the cover pretty much daily. That got old quick so I got a cute skin. Always a work around.  Keep in mind, I’m not an expert, I’m an end user and I think this laptop  will do nicely. When the box arrived the charger was missing. I immediately emailed the seller and they sent one right out. Mistakes happen, but they were very responsive.

Now I can't run for more than an hour without it CRASHING again and again with the same error message.

  I got this computer specifically for the keyboard.  4 months into it, the bracket breaks on my ""k"" key.  It's under waranty, so Lenovo will fix it, but it will take 3+ weeks and I won't be able to wor.  I can't get a loaner, because I didn't purchase the laptop directly from Lenovo, so I have no way to mae a claim.  It's pretty frustrating.  Outside of an obscenely long repair job from the manufacturer, the seller who purchased it (Issaquah Highlands Tech) from Lenovo is washing their hands because it lasted more than a month (lol) which is the minimum that amazon requires (lol).  So I would avoid using this seller, and I would advise considering buying directly from the manufacturer purchases like these.  This is my second Lenovo, the first being a Yoga 910 that lasted many years.  The eyboard on this one lasted 4 months, and that's specifically why I got it.  Pretty frustrating to say the least.Also, the camera is very low quality, the screen is not very bright at certain angles, and while the layout of the keys is very nice, the quality of the eyboard is questionable at best.  If I could do it over, I would definitely not have chosen this computer or this seller.

  I am VERY disappointed especially for the money. I mainly got this to work with my pictures at the same time I upgraded my camera. I only got this laptop was because my computer tech son did the research for me and suggested it.

  The unit I received (16GB RAM, 512 GB NVME SSD) was unable to wake up after going to sleep due to idle. If you use the [Start]->Power->Sleep menu option in Win10, it was able to wake up. This was also a 1st gen E15, not the latest 2nd Gen E15 that is widely available. The SSD was an aftermarket brand ""OEM Genuine"" with what appears to be a solid Silicon Motion controller. Otherwise the keyboard was comfortable and the design looks and feels sharp. I am just very disappointed with the inability to wake up from sleep - and I wonder if this has anything to do with the aftermarket upgrades.

  It's a good laptop. I was nervous because of the 4 GB and worried it will run slow. I had to download Zoom and had to switch out of S mode....then I realized the computer was running extremely slow.

So when i opened the box the color of it Had me right there. a beautiful Red. i was scared to get it out but i finally did and have been on it constantly. Easy to use perfect size (for me) it is a beautiful wonderful laptop. It came with all the bells and whistles. and is easy to load new apps. has up to date apps also. But i did my research and wanted an HP. they are reliable constant and keeps growing.

  I had a 2016 MBP and noticed that when editing 4k video it was almost impossible. I am not an editing pro but its been a hobby for 18 years. I was very hopeful that upgrading to the new M1 chip would help that. my old computer was only an 8Gig so I upgraded to a 16Gig. even though Adobe PP does not support the M1 chip yet. it still was lightning fast. rendering video that used to take 4 hours now take on average 20 min. Now when I think about doing a video project I get excited and not discouraged. If you are looking for an upgrade. you will not be disappointed.

  What was once a difficult thing to accomplish on a Mac is now a dream! This thing plays games just like you would on your ps4. Comparable quality for sure. Not sure about ps5 since I don’t own one. But definitely enjoy it now as much as playing on my ps4.

  This is the perfect laptop for me. Extremely fast bootup, actually very fast everything. I do quite a bit on Excel, it loads almost instantly. Browsing speeds are very good even with my mediocre ISP. I really like this computer, It does everything a laptop should very well.  I haven't tried any gaming on it, but it's not a gaming laptop.

  This thing is complete garbage. I bought it for my dad, and I spent an hour setting it up, but it immediately disabled the touchpad (as in completely wiped it from the system). Any effort to restore it failed, so I had to do a complete reset on it just to get back one of the most basic features of any such device.This is the last time I will ever buy a Lenovo product. Not remotely worth the frustration.

  The 10th gen i3 gets the job done. We're not using it for gaming; just needed a replacement for my wife's aging Chromebook. It's super snappy and smooth with everyday web browsing, Office app usage, etc. I do wish they put a backlight in the keyboard, but not a deal breaker. Have also seen a few reviews online complaining about screen ""wash out"" but we have seen none of that. I'm not sure how many people use their laptops outside.. the brightness is perfect indoors but no clue how it would perform outside (not something we'll ever need). Good purchase, great seller.

  This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.

  The FHD (1920x1080p) version of the Lenovo S330 definitely does NOT have an IPS display. The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients.Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's. It'll work...but why?

  ... you receive a written promise from Lenovo quality control that they'll pay YOU for the time you'll need to spend doing their job for them. I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue.The value proposition for this Chromebook is that you can simply open the box, and get started working, hassle-free.  Value has not been delivered. If I wanted this much aggravation, I'd run one of my old Dell's with Vista.UPDATE: 4/23. Ran powerwash two more times. Spoke with Amazon. Spoke with Lenovo. Ran complete recovery of Chrome OS. Still freezes and crashes. Just ordered a second one for arrival 4/23, and am returning this one. Perhaps this one is just a lemon. If the second machine works as it should, I'll update here. If it doesn't, I'll return it also and post a second review. Total time wasted so far: 12 hours and counting.

  I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. However, it arrived as scheduled in great condition. We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it. Would recommend!

  UPDATE March 23, 2020:It's been a month-and-a-half since my original review (below). I still very much love this laptop. Admittedly, the ""Bad"" list (below) might sound overly negative, but I'm just being real. The laptop isn't perfect, but *for me* the pros still outweigh the cons and I'd still buy this again in an instant. It's totally understandable if some of these things are deal-breakers for other people -- but if you still get the laptop, hopefully this review helps you understand what you're getting.Good:- Still love the large screen and light weight (doesn't feel bulky to me)- Still enjoy the keyboard layout and number pad- So far, no bends or dents. The lid hinge is still tight/stable.- Trackpad works well, feels good.- The screen and resolution are bright and crisp enough for me.Bad (although none of these are deal-breakers for me, some of them are annoying):- The included charger charges SOOOO slowly. The laptop takes hours to charge. Even going from 20% to say 70% takes forever -- it's only a little better if you shut it off/standby/hibernate first. This is my biggest complaint.- The WiFi takes forever to reconnect when resuming Windows from standby or hibernate. This is my second biggest complaint. It seems to happen on different WiFi networks and a none of my other laptops have had this problem on those same WiFi networks. I Googled a lot to try to fix this, but nothing worked -- including latest drivers. This is probably more of a Windows config/driver problem, but it's still happening on my laptop and I can't fix it.- Battery life isn't great. When studying I get maybe 5 hours before draining to 20ish%. Obviously this will be different for everyone because we all run different apps or have different things running in the background, but I'm surprised it isn't better.- Speakers aren't very good. They're not super loud but not very clear either. Pretty disappointing. They sound like they vibrate/resonate when playing particular frequencies. The speakers aren't blown for sure, they just rattle in those very specific instances for some reason.- I've resorted to only using hibernate when I close the laptop lid (versus just going into standby). The laptop doesn't seem to handle standby well and still runs for quite a while before actually going to standby (if at all). Sometimes I put the laptop in a fitted soft case and I later find out that Windows never really went on standby and I now have a dead battery or I find that the laptop is really hot from running while trapped in the case. Hibernate is fine and it's not slow, but it's annoying that standby doesn't work like it does for other laptops. Probably a Windows issue if anything, but I couldn't find any fixes for this -- and I've tried a lot.- I wish the track pad was centered relative to the keyboard's home row and space bar, i.e. a little bit more to the left.- The CPU has throttled down to 0.4 GHz (400 MHz) on occasion. Not a lot though. I wasn't doing anything intensive. Maybe Windows was indexing? Generally, doesn't seem to thermal throttle much though.=====ORIGINAL REVIEW February 4, 2020:I decided I wanted a lightweight, large screen laptop so the LG Gram 17 was really the only option -- other light laptops aren't 17"", and other 17"" laptops aren't lightweight. Because of this I admit that this laptop is on the pricey side, but that's to be expected if there are no direct competitors. I've been waiting for the 10th Gen Intel processor. It runs at a lower clock speed than the previous 8th Gen processor, but according to benchmarks it's faster and has better power efficiency. The 10 nm vs the 8th Gen 14 nm manufacturing helps. I haven't had this long enough yet to comment on everyday use, but I'll tell you my first impressions.Similar to the previous model, it's lightweight with a large screen. The CPU isn't super fast, but that wasn't what was important to me. I wanted long battery life and a large screen. I'm a student so both of these benefit me more than a super-fast processor. The processor is fast enough for what I need it for. A lot of YouTube reviewers don't like this laptop because they think the CPU is under-powered -- they think the only people who want 17"" screens are content creators like them, but they're not understanding the audience that actually appreciate what this laptop has to offer. My previous laptop had a 4k 15"" touchscreen. I'll have to say that I thought I'd use those options more than I really did. I appreciate that this laptop has a lower resolution (but still high enough to be crisp) to help with battery life. Also, I didn't find the touchscreen useful at all so I'm glad this doesn't have it.Some of the things I've read from the previous year's model is that the laptop would consume more power than it could charge when under load (maybe high CPU-intensive tasks? or charging a phone on USB?). So essentially people would say that their battery would drain even while charging, which I think is pretty bad. Hopefully the power-efficiency of the new CPU will help with that, but I don't know if that's still a problem. Also, people said that the CPU would thermal throttle with the 8th Gen Intel. Again, not sure yet if this model will do that, but I'm hoping that the lower clock speed and the better efficiency of the 10th Gen will alleviate that. Also, an LG spokesperson somewhere said that this laptop has ""better cooling"" than the previous gen. I don't know if that's true, but if it is, hopefully that helps as well.Here are my other first impressions. The keyboard keys are quiet but a little mushy. Not the best, but it's good enough. Also, the new keyboard layout with the expanded backspace and enter keys and the four-column number pad seem better than the previous model. When I first typed on the keyboard, I, like a lot of other reviewers, wasn't used to shifting my typing to the left of the screen, but I'm confident that I'll get used to it. I don't use the number pad a lot, but on my desktop I do use it from time to time, so I think the laptop having it isn't a con. Having the proper number pad layout was important to me though because I type by muscle memory and am really fast with the number pad when I need it. The screen is bright enough. I don't like how glossy it is, but this is easily fixable. All my previous laptops had glossy screens and I always covered it up with anti-glare screen protectors. If you can install them correctly, then it's just as good as having an OEM anti-glare screen. People who complain about glossy screens don't usually know that they can correct the issue pretty easily. The trackpad works really well. It's smooth and has a good texture and feels similar to a Macbook Pro which is a good thing. The clickiness of it though is a bit mushy and soft (meaning the travel to push down on the trackpad to click isn't super-deep and it doesn't have a terribly satisfying click to it), but it's adequate and not horrible. I think it's fine. The fingerprint reader worked well, just as good as other laptops I've had. One thing I don't like is that it has Windows 10 Home instead of Pro. Personally I use Bitlocker and would have preferred Pro for this. I may upgrade, but it's an extra cost.Spec-wise, here are some things that I noticed that some people might find useful. The memory is faster than the previous model's. It runs at 3200 MHz instead of 2400 MHz (see screenshot). The CPU base clock speed is slower (1.3 GHz vs 1.8 GHz) and the turbo is slower (3.9 GHz vs 4.6 GHz), but according to benchmarks if the 10th Gen has better processing power, better efficiency, runs cooler, and contributes to longer battery life, then I think this is a win. People would say that the 8th Gen would thermal throttle so getting the max turbo wasn't attainable anyway, so hopefully the new CPU will fix this. One thing I didn't like was that they include two 512 GB M.2 SSDs. Why not just one 1 TB? I saw that another store has the same LG model but with only one 512 GB for $350 cheaper. Looking back on it, I should've bought that and use the difference to upgrade to one 1 TB or 2 TB SSD and sell the 512 GB. I was really hoping they would have at least set up the two SSDs in a RAID 0 configuration so I could have one logical 1 TB drive, but they don't. I included a screenshot of the SSDs that are included (Samsung MZVLB512HAJQ, M.2, 3000 MB/s seq. read, 270K IOPS ran. read, PRIe Gen 3 x4, 1800 MB/s seq. write, 420K IOPS ran. write -- according to Samsung's web site). I also included the TPM information that's listed in the BIOS. Again, because Bitlocker is important to me, I was interested in the TPM. My family's phones and WiFi router all use WiFi 6 (802.11ax) so I'm glad this laptop has it to take advantage of my home network's infrastructure. I can confirm that this laptop also supports the new WPA3 which my router and phones are also using.The things included with the laptop are just the tiny power brick and an Ethernet to USB-C adapter. I love how small and light the power brick is, but I guess we'll have to see if it's under-powered. I've also read that you can charge this laptop using USB-C power delivery. I'm not sure of the wattage it allows, but this is something that I'd like to look into.So all in all, it's too soon for me to really give a long-term review, but I did want to give some information which isn't really shown anywhere else (LG's website, etc.). Yes, the laptop is pricey for what it is, but again, it's the only lightweight laptop that comes in 17"". LG probably won't lower the price until there's more competition in this area, so the high price is expected. Also, this is a niche product. Only certain people want the big screen, the light weight, and moderate processing power. All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase so far. I really do appreciate the better keyboard layout. A non-standard keyboard layout (3-column number pad) is a deal breaker for me, which is why I waited for this version of the laptop rather than getting the previous version.

  Initial impressions of the laptop (weight, battery life, size) are great as written by other reviewers. But after service, driver support and warranty (which no reviewers wrote about) are where the problems are with this laptop. I learnt all this the hard way.Warranty is void on this computer the moment you open the back cover to upgrade your SSD or RAM. This is an up-gradable laptop with an empty SSD slot, and a removable RAM slot.All the Youtube influences talk about how lightweight and configurable the laptop is but they don't tell you that the warranty is void when you open the back cover.Also, if there is a problem with the laptop, you need to send it with the SSD inside to their Michigan repair center, and it will take ten business days for them to ship your laptop back. If you want to remove the SSD (it contains all your information and passwords), before sending a defective laptop, warranty is again void.I learn't all this by speaking with their call center agent. When I asked them why have an empty SSD slot then? The answer was, ""You should upgrade it after the warranty period is over! "".What they are doing is illegal in the United States. This is a violation of Magnuson-Moss Warrany Act. Companies can't void a consumer's warranty or deny warranty coverage solely because the consumer uses a part made by someone else or gets someone not authorized by the company to perform service on the product.There should be a way Amazon forces these companies to clearly state the warranty of their products on Amazon's website for their customers benefit. 1800$ is not chump change.Four Months after Use:1. Update drivers are not present on LG Website.2. Customer wait times are horrible when you call technical support. Email support is non existent. You cannot reply back to the email, technical support will send you. You will be directed to a chatbot, that doesn't even automatically take you to the right division in LG - In this case computers.3. Computer has a Windows App called LG Update Center, where you can update drivers, software etc for the laptop. The issue is, they don't tell you the release date, release notes, or anything about the update on the App.4. When I emailed technical support about this issue (was trying to update the BIOS, and I asked the release date of the bios, as it wasn't present in the LG Update Center App), they directed me to go to Phoenix Bios website and download from there directly the latest drivers. Problem is Phoenix bios makes you install spamware and charges your credit card. Do not install the biosagentplus spamware. You will waste another one day cleaning up the LG computer.I do like the weight of the laptop. But after service doesn't exist. Warranty is useless. Company is good at making Washing Machines and Dryers and they tried to make Cell-Phones, and failed. Now they are trying to make laptops, and don't have a clue of how to go about software updates, customer support and Warranty issues.

  I use my computer to work, listen to music, stream movies.  I'm hard of hearing and often have the volume all the way up.  You can't do that with this one, the voices sound like they are in a tin can.  For as much as this cost ($1700), I would have expected better speakers.  My previous computer, at less than half the cost of this one, had better speakers.Update: I also watch education webinars for work.  Every since video from here, netflix or amazon prime, doesn't line up the video with the audio.  I can go to 2 other computers in the house and have no issue.  A new computer should not work like this.

  Laptop was delivered within a week. Arrived as described. Windows setup has certainly improved. Almost idiot proof. On the other side, I thought I purchased windows operation system without the Win S mode. ( This allows app download only through Microsoft store.

I had thought about getting a mac but price wise it was out of range. The pavilion is very smooth and crisp in a way. I use it for online class and I have to run some programs for my science classes. It has NOT let me down. I've been using it for about a month now and it still works like new. The setup took me like 15 minutes when I first got it. The only things that I believe could be a con for some is that the battery will not last a whole day. I start class at around 8:20 am and around 12 pm the battery is dead, there is a battery saver button tho and it usually let's my battery last an extra hour or so. Tablet mode is fun, I don't usually use it so I have no comment on that. Regardless, very good product for the price. Would 100% recommend for college students. I don't think this would be a good choice for gaming tho. (sorry for the stickers!)Edit: it has been almost a year since I bought this laptop. It's very sturdy tho it seems light, I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. I take it with me on my backpack (usually besides my tennis racket) again, no dents or scratches. I dropped water on it too a few times, works like new (not saying that it is waterproof, maybe I was lucky) but very strong overall. I've taken a few coding classes that include python, HTML, and CSS and it runs it with no problem. It is very fast, very very fast, personally I keep photos, music, documents and such in an USB which leaves my laptop pretty empty so it could be because of that. Camera is pretty good, gets you through zoom, speakers are good as well. Overall, a year later and I still think this laptop is a 5/5.

  Many things I love about this laptop. Great battery life, it is lightweight it is touchscreen and has tablet mode. I picked it because it had a backlit keyboard in the specs but it does not (but not bugged enough to send it back). I am annoyed at the placement of the power button it is on the side where you grab the laptop to move it and I keep bumping it and turning off the computer. Getting knocked out of Zoom meetings is really annoying. Again I will deal with it but will definitely think about his when I am looking for a new computer.

  HP Pavilion x360 14-inch 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD Storage, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Amazon Alexa Voice Compatible (14-dh2011nr, Natural Silver)Look and FeelWith the exception of the hinges, the laptop shell is entirely made of plastic.  The finish on the top (opposite the screen) is painted to mimic the look of  brushed aluminum.  It looks pretty convincing whilst it's new but I expect that as it gets scratched over the course of its lifetime it will be very obvious even from a distance that it's just painted plastic.The hinge is very nicely designed, moves smoothly and holds sturdily.  There's no wiggle or play, it's just very solid.The whole thing weighs in at 3 lb 9 oz. not counting the power adapter.KeyboardThe keyboard layout is comfortable and doesn't have any unusual key placement or size.  This may not seem noteworthy if you've never used a laptop that did something strange with the keyboard (I'm looking at you Lenovo), but trust me, it matters.Another nice thing about a fairly standardized keyboard layout is the ready availability of keyboard covers.  Although this model is not specifically listed as compatible, this cover fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KKYXXR.  I've had more than one device saved by silicone keyboard covers like this and I strongly recommend them for anyone buying one of these. (I'm not recommending any cover specifically, merely providing an example of one that perfectly fits.  This way you can take the model numbers from that listing and look for others if you like)The keys themselves are well-designed low-profile keys. They're quiet and responsive.  I don't have any problems with bounce and the (mostly) full-width keys are still comfortable under my large hands.The keyboard backlight is very well designed.  Each of the keys including its alternate function (punction etc...) are illuminated cleanly.  There are three backlight levels, though I find the lower intensity unnecessary as the default setting is bright enough to see in a brightly lit room and not overpowering in a dark room.TouchpadThe touchpad is basically standard fare.  It's designed well enough that I didn't find myself accidentally moving the mouse pointer while typing.  Though I still prefer a USB mouse, the touchpad is very serviceable.DisplayThe screen is extremely glossy and will reflect absolute anything remotely bright behind you.  It's not terribly noticeable when you're working with bright/white content on the screen - such as in a word processor or reading most web pages, but when there is darker content on the screen as often happens when watching videos it's surface becomes like a mirror.  That didn't seem like a good design choice to me but maybe having a mirror finish is necessary because it's a touch-screen?The edge-lit IPS does offer a bright and clear image, though it's not as bright as I would like.  Since I don't have a reliable method for measuring nits my evaluation of its brightness is going to be subjective. In summer noontime daylight it's noticeably dimmer than other 300 nit screens I have tested, though it is still somewhat readable if you stay in the shade so I would guestimate it's brightness between 230 and 250 nits.  I would consider this screen as being mostly for indoor use though, as I said, it is marginally usable outdoors on a sunny day provided you have ample shade.  If used in a darker environment the screen is bright but does suffer from typical LCD uniformity problems (see the image of a blank screen attached to this review).The refresh rate of the display seems to be locked at 59Hz.  Being an IPS screen it has very fast switching so it passed the blur-busters tests just fine - motion blur is all but non-existent making it great for watching video.The capacitive touch screen is very responsive and feels accurate even with my giant fingers.  I don't have a stylus to test so I can't comment on compatibility or accuracy of that.Real-Life Windows 10 (Not S Mode!)A lot of this 2-in-1 style of laptop come with an operating system called “Windows 10 Home in S Mode”.  “S Mode” is a highly limited implementation of Windows 10 that only allows you to use the Edge browser and only allows you to run software from the Microsoft App Store.  The inclusion of “S Mode” rather than a real-life Windows 10 is usually an indication that the vendor was not confident that the hardware provided would actually be able to run Windows 10.  Thankfully this laptop comes with a fully enabled implementation of Windows 10 Home and in my testing it performed just fine.Included SoftwareWhat would setting up a new machine be without going through and removing all of the pre-loaded garbage vendors always like to cram in?  This machine comes with a pretty standard complement of bloatware, “free trial” and offer software.  In case those terms don't mean anything to you, it basically referrs to apps that are more about getting you on the hook for paying fees for services than they are about increasing your productivity.Some of the trialware/offerware is built in to Windows 10 itself, some of it comes from HP.  I can't really provide a comprehensive list of what I think you should immediately remove from this laptop upon powering it up, but I will recommend two that you should immediately get rid of.  First is McAfee LiveSafe which is a waste of space that will soak up resources without actually protecting your computer then expire in a year or six months or whenever and beg for more money.  Just uninstall it and reboot – your machine will automatically switch to the built-in Windows Defender anti-malware which is free with Windows, won't kill your battery and actually does a much better job stopping and cleaning malware.  The second thing I recommend you immediately get rid of is “WildTangent Games”.  You'll need to remove both the “App” and the installed program to get rid of it entirely.  I'm deeply disappointed that HP thinks so little of its customers that it would ship this machine with WildTangent Games pre-installed.  During my days as a PC tech WildTangent Games were a universally despised vehicle for spyware.There were quite a few other things I removed right away like Express VPN, Dropbox Offer, Microsoft Office etc... If you don't remove these they will periodically pop up and annoy you by either trying to talk you or scare you into signing up for new services.  If you want cloud-based backup signing up for a Microsoft Account gets you some free “OneDrive” space and if you need more it's worth paying for it – you don't need both Dropbox and OneDrive. The Microsoft Office stuff gives you minimal access to Microsoft Word and tries to get you to sign up for paid services to get the rest.  I switched to OpenOffice years ago and have never looked back.  If you need a VPN service and don't already have one, I suggest you shop around a little rather than just go for Express VPN.  But I digress.  I strongly recommend you go through the installed “Apps” and remove anything that says “Offer” next to it.Convertible / 2-in-1 featuresThe ability to use the “convertible” features was the thing that most attracted me to this machine.  I enjoy watching movies without having to be tethered to any particular room (and when traveling)Laptop ModeIn laptop mode this is just like any other slim-line laptop.  This configuration offers the best/clearest sound as the speakers fire up from the far side of the keyboard, and the best overall ergonomics.Tent ModeIn Tent Mode the laptop is folded into an upside-down V shape and propped up on a surface.  This is by far my favorite mode for watching movies and TV with this machine, but it does come with extra considerations.  In this mode the speakers are pointed away from you, though in my testing I was still able to hear things just fine.  It would have been nice if they had included some silicone or rubber bumpers on the edge to keep the laptop from slipping or to keep rough surfaces from scuffing up the edge of laptop itself.Tablet ModeTablet mode is a bit of a mixed bag.  Essentially you fold the laptop closed backwards with the keyboard and screen on the outside.  The keyboard is disabled in this mode.  While you can use this laptop sort of like you would a tablet, its extra bulk is a definite factor.  The larger difficulty I had, however, was in holding it in a way that did not result in accidentally activating some control or scrolling to the bottom of a page because my fingers tickled the edge of the touch screen.  Switching to ""Tablet Mode"" in Windows 10 did very little to alleviate this.  Also in tablet mode it's difficult to adjust the screen brightness or volume.  I think this mode would be much better if they would provide volume and brightness controls on the edge of the machine and some software adjustment to move controls away from the edges where you're likely to accidently activate them while just trying to hold the ""tablet"" in place.SpeakersMuch is made of the ""Audio by Bang and Olufsen"".  For such small speakers they do sound remarkably clear and present a wider dynamic range than I would expect, but that being said don't expect miracles.  I had to max out the volume in a couple of instances while watching shows in tent mode and even then it did not sound particularly loud.Battery LifeWithout trying to apply any scientific process to judge battery life, I noted while using it that I was able to get about 4-5 hours out of a charge when just browsing the web, watching the occasional YouTube video and writing in a word processor.  It was only about 2.5 to 3 hours while watching Netflix or other videos at full brightness.  At 3470mAh the capacity isn't terribly impressive, but for such a lightweight system it seems just right.WiFi speedThe multi-function Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in one chip provided with this laptop provides thoroughly average performance.  In practice I was able to get transfer speeds of almost 10MB/s (Bytes not bits), which is more than enough for most day-to day activities, but doesn't come close to the performance tuned chips in some of the other laptops I've reviewed, some of which were able to more than double that throughput.  Again, I don't consider this a drawback because it provides perfectly adequate performance for general purpose computing.Webcam / MicrophoneThe built in webcam is very generic with a 720x1280 sensor.  Like most generic webcams, it has a very low ISO sensitivity and therefore requires a decent amount of ambient light to show a clear picture.  In a darker environment the image becomes grainy and video smears as the camera tries to compensate for low light.  I wouldn't try to record for YouTube on it, but it's perfectly serviceable for web conferencing as long as you're in a well-lit room.The built-in microphone on the other hand actually sounds pretty good, picking up voice clean and clear.  The documentation doesn't say for sure, but it's possible the mic was also designed by B&O. In any case I think they did a terrific job for a built-in mic.StorageOne of the things I look for in a laptop is the ability to upgrade the primary storage.  In general if you see ""eMMC"" listed on the description it means that the primary storage (i.e. hard drive) is soldered in and is generally more trouble than it's worth to swap out.  I'm happy to report that this laptop actually has full M.2 NVMe SSD which can, if the need arises, be replaced with a larger capacity drive, though the 512GB drive it ships with is plenty big for my needs. This laptop was clearly not designed to be upgraded or serviced by end users as evidenced by how annoying they made it to take apart, but once I had the back off it looks like it was designed to incorporate a full SATA SSD as well with a spot carved out under the right palm rest and an unpopulated ribbon socket labeled ""HDD1"".  I could not find any documentation on this (as of the time of this review), so I'm not sure if it's an either-or where you have to pick one or the other or if you can use both a SATA and M.2 drive at the same time. I was unable to test this because I don't have the proprietary adapter to connect the drive to the board.The supplied 512GB NVMe drive perfomed adequately but maxed out at ~1GB/s writes and  ~1.5GB/s reads.  This is somewhat normal for a budget drive but about half the potential of the NVMe spec.  As it would have involved re-installing Windows 10, I did not wish to try out a faster NVMe drive to see if the limitation lies with the drive itself or the controller.  Since you're not going to be gaming on this laptop, the drive speeds are absolutely fine.CPU/GPU Performance / ThrottlingSo does this laptop throttle the CPU?  While my default is to assume that it throttles the CPU/GPU until proven otherwise, most of my attempts to verify one way or the other have been stymied by the unavailability of system hooks used by the Intel XTU (which flat out refuses to install) or MSI Afterburner (installs but can't actually see anything). With a base frequency of 1GHz the machine runs pretty cool most of the time.  The fan isn't really capable of moving much heat so I seriously doubt that you will ever see a ""burst"" to 3.6GHz, but again unless you're trying to game on this machine that's largely immaterial.In my testing what games I was able to get running ran reasonably well at medium to high settings - older games ran fine at high settings, newer ones needed to be dialed back.  Even though this isn't a gaming machine it's a good indication of what its capable of.I had no trouble editing large images with GIMP, including computationally complex operations such as perspective shift and de-noise algorithms.The full-sized HDMI port makes it easy to connect a second monitor up to 4k@60 (it will default to 4k@30, but can be switched to 60Hz and in my testing works without any issues).  Likewise it was able to render web pages and video in 4K just as smoothly as it did in 1080p.GamingThis isn't a gaming laptop – which is probably obvious to anyone reading this, but even the most businesslike user may be tempted to dabble now and again.  I had considerable trouble getting games to run reliably on this.  Most titles crashed to desktop after one to five minutes without so much as a helpful error message.  What I did have some luck with were older titles like BioShock, Deus Ex Human Revolution etc...Watching VideoFor video playback I tested a variety of scenarios.  Playback of H265 10-bit 4K (HDMI Outputs 4K) content was basically smooth and flawless as was Blu-ray playback via VLC and libaacs. Both YouTube and Netflix had occasional stuttering on 1080p content but I'm being very nit-picky.  If I was not paying specific attention to how smooth playback was I would probably not have noticed.Miscellaneous- Unfortunately the 14-dh2011nr doesn't support Power Delivery which means that it can't be charged via the USB-C port like some of the higher-end x360's can.  In my opinion this is a huge missed opportunity as the ability to charge via USB-C makes it easier to purchase extra power adapters (one for home one for the office, etc...) and opens up the possibility of extending runtime while traveling by using a large power bank that supports PD.- Had to use compatibility mode to get certain apps (OpenOffice) to properly scale fonts etc... This is generally caused by the display drivers not being full featured enough to support the DPI mode being set from the app.- Like most laptop power adapters, there is no obvious way to wrap the cord to minimize the space it takes up inside your bag.- The USB ports had no trouble delivering enough power to power external spinning hard drives and optical drives without needing to use a second power source. This also means that if you use this laptop's ports to charge other devices over USB they may charge faster if the device is designed to take advantage of higher-amperage power sources.Conclusion:The 14-dh2011nr isn't the most powerful, doesn't have the brightest screen, isn't the fastest, but it has all around great features and performance for this price range.  It's perfect for surfing the web, web conferencing, editing photos, and watching movies or shows.  It's one of the best priced 2-in-1 laptops I've seen that's capable of running ful
-blown Windows 10 Home and doesn't feel sluggish in the slightest.  It's quiet, has good battery life, lightweight and an all around pleasure to use.  In short it's exactly what I was looking for.Pros:- Lightweight and thin- Full-sized standard keyboard (compatible with available keyboard covers)- Full-sized HDMI socket - supports 4K@60 just fine- Full Windows 10 Home (NOT ""S Mode"")- Good battery life- Convertable has great options for watching video or working without a keyboard- Quiet fan - even going full blast it's barely above a whisper- Decent amount of storage - 512GB- Legit M.2 drive (so it's upgradeable)- Great built-in mic- The full-sized USB 3.0 ports deliver enough amperage to support power-hungry devices like external hard drives and external DVD/Blu-ray drivesCons:- Shiny reflective screen surface can be really distracting  (mostly during dark scenes in videos)- No ""bumpers"" or rubber feet to protect the edge and stop slipping in Tent Mode- Screen is only around ~240 nits makes it only marginally usable in daylight - this is really an indoor screen- Pre-loaded with bloatware/nagware software including the spyware ""WildTangent Games""Neutral Observations:- Can't really game on it (newer titles seem to run okay but almost all of them crash out in the first minute)- Tablet mode is novel but difficult to use because controls are on the edge where you're holding your fingers- The GPU is extremely basic and lacks any options for monitoring- The CPU lacks the normal system hooks for monitoring

  After two weeks of use, I like the feel and action of the keyboard and that it is lighted. Everyday light computing will not tax this machine but I am not sure how it would be for gaming or intensive graphic manipulation. Battery life is less than 3-4 hours of light computing. I'm not sure I'll keep this machine, mostly because of the battery life and feeling unsure of whether it truly has DDR 4 ram.

  The first one I received quickly locked up and prevented downloading items from Microsoft store or even windows updates.  No matter what I tried, it would not work right.  During discussions with Amazon to return item, It was recommended that I try another one.  I did and that one has worked really, really well.  The start up time is pronominal, everything seems to work very well except for the battery life.  It goes quickly.  However, I am so happy with the rest of the laptop that I have chosen to ignore the number of times I have to hook up to charge.  Overall, it's a very good laptop which I did not think I would say based on the first one I got.  I gave it four stars because of all the problems with the first laptop.

  I love that it is lightweight and smaller. It's not tablet size, but its not bulky like other laptops. I bought it for my home based business and it works great. The down side is that when you first start it up and set it up it is set as Windows 10 S and you are unable to install apps that are not Microsoft approved like Chrome, Firefox, Facebook Messenger, and Adobe Acrobat. However, you can find similar apps on the Microsoft store. If you would rather have Win 10 then you can switch to it from either the Microsoft store or your settings. You will lose some of the Windows 10 S features like the extra security protection. Another reason I gave 4 stars on storage capacity is that there is only 5 gigs of one drive space. You can either upgrade or if you have a family or business version of Microsoft Office 365 then you'll have the full 1TB of one drive space. I plan to upgrade the hard drive in the future to a 1TB.Overall, it is a great buy and perfect for what I need it for. I chose to keep the Win 10 S as the operating system. And I just transferred my files to my one drive account I have associated with Microsoft Family so I have all my files. I just delete what I don't need from my main account after it has been uploaded to my secondary account. Just a word of warning you are not able to link Microsoft accounts to each other so make sure when you set up your laptop that you choose the account you want to login with because once it is set it cannot be changed.

  Update - The seller came through and now I have the correct AC adapter. As I stated earlier once I switched to the standard Windows 10 Home, everything is working great and much faster than my old laptop.I had to switch to windows 10 home, that was simple so I could install quickbooks.

  Laptop was good but incredibly basic and too much money for its limited capability, also too small for my interest, so I returned it. The seller made me pay a $100 restocking fee!!! I've never seen something like that before and its ridiculous. It was deducted from my refund. Definitely don't buy unless you're sure. Its a good laptop you get what you ask for but the seller is unreasonable in the refund aspect. And It took 10 days after they received the item for me to even get my heavily deducted refund.

  On the advise of my son I upped the features of my new laptop. My last laptop was 6 years old and cost $250. I got my monies worth. This new computer is lighter, faster and works as soon as I turn it on. I guess I kept my old computer too long when I think that is one of it's best features! This keyboard does not have the number keypad on the right hand side so I will have to get used to that. I used a flash drive to move all of my files and pictures over. So far, I would say it is a great purchase.

  I use this for personal and business computing at home - currently independent contractor.  Screen size is good - can use stand-alone (when I travel) but add larger screen at home for second screen.  Keyboard is also fine for travel, which again I supplement at home with separate key board.  Could have used more ports but extension ports seem work fine.  I am not a Google fan so the Microsoft suite (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc.) work fine for me - although Edge I am not crazy about.  Google and other aps work fine.I only gave 4 stars as every new computer set up is a pain.  Dell has been a reliable partner of mine for years.

  I am very happy with the laptop. Since all of the wireless mouse, that I have gotten, were not a success, it was great to find that, all I need use is a finger. Plus, it does have USB 2.0 (socket) that allows me to my corded mouse, and my printer.

  The Dell model 3583 is specified (Dell Specs p.12) with an 8th generation Intel core i3, i5, or i7 CPU. I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD.  That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream! In addition - 3583 comes spec'd with Win 10 Home (not S mode). S mode sucks and the time it takes to dump it is a pain. 2cts.

  Do not waste your money or your time and energy. Please! I felt like everyone else who gave this a chance. I was nervous buying a refurbished computer, but this site had pretty good reviews overall. I was definitely wrong. The laptop shipped quick, but as soon as I pulled it out of the box- it wouldn’t turn on. I tried everything, eventually the following day I brought it to the Apple store to just make sure it wasn’t something as easy as the charger not working. NOPE! That’s when they were able to tell me the laptop had this weird covering on the bottom of it- which covered all the computers info. Turns out, it came from a school. They said it was definitely sketchy and had a hardware issue. I sent it back- it’s taken almost 2 weeks since I sent it out to get my refund- they issued it today, but it still says it would take 3-5 days to get in my account. What a freaking headache and waste!!

  I was expecting a computer with scratches and obvious wear, but there were only two scuffs on the side of the computer which are barely noticeable and well-hidden with a plastic hard-case protector. The computer is rather small and light-weight. Think: iPad Pro with an attached keyboard.The battery life is pretty good for this kind of computer, but that’s just coming from a college student who only uses it to write essays and browse the internet; I don’t use it for more professional tasks like video-editing . Someone previously said the screen is yellowish but that wasn’t the case for me. All in all, it’s a really good, functional computer for the price. I’ll change my review if I encounter problems.

  I was nervous about buying a refurbished Mac after reading so many negative reviews, but I'm glad I did!  This is a great computer, updated with the latest OS and from early 2015.  For me, this is great for what I need it for.  I purchased the additional warranty just incase.  So far, I'm happy with my purchase!  My best advice is to read the seller's feedback page before buying.

  I ordered this Mac Book Air, and reading from the description, I was thinking it would be wonderful. It was a good price, and I'm very familiar with Mac Books. I ordered this sometime in July, and it has worked perfectly. I decorated the outside with some of my favorite stickers, and I had all my information on there. It was my favorite thing I bought.""Oh, well why did you give it one star?"" you're probably wondering. Well friend, you see, this product came without 2 essential parts on the backside of the keyboard. When December came, my keyboard stopped responding to the computer completely. I called Apple about the issue, and what they told me over phone did not work. I had to visit Apple in person, so they could look at it. I was there for hours, and nothing got solved. So I then visited a Professional Computer-Repairman, and when he took apart the backside of the keyboard, he saw nothing wrong, until he looked deeper. He found that I was missing 2 essential parts to my laptop. He tried ordering these parts from China, but they have not responded.I have tried contacting Amazon many times, and they're not willing to help me out since my computer was purchased months ago, so it passed the 90 day rule. I feel as though this special situation should grant me a refund. But nope. Next time I order a laptop I will go to a Repair shop, have them take it apart, and see if anything is wrong. If there is, at least I can send it back within 90 days :).Ohhhh wait, I can't order a new laptop! I'm a poor college student and only had enough money for a laptop when I originally bought this one. And it was a complete dud! Can't wait to spend the rest of my college days in a computer lab. I don't think I'll ever buy from Amazon again. I'm sorry.

  After conducting research, I chose this laptop for my business purposes: both running day to day online operations, but more importantly powerful enough to use in 3D modeling for new development of physical products and additive manufacturing.The machine arrived quickly, but I should have expected something to be wrong when I noted there was no packaging material in the shipping box.  I opened the interior package containing the laptop and the factory packaging appeared undamaged as well as reasonably robust.Then I began the process of starting up my new device.  In the middle of the screen the system was clearly having problems.  Note the attached pictures.  I went went to the manufacturer's website and made sure the latest drivers were downloaded and installed.  I conducted the manufacturers online tests and this did not remedy the issue.  Sadly I would have to return/replace this.Here is where it becomes absurd.  I drove to the Amazon store at Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree, Colorado.  I wanted to expedite the return process, and I conceived of Amazon being interested in getting a replacement to me quickly.  I offered to come back to this location the next day if they could replace it quickly.  They would not be able to replace it quickly. Not only was this not possible (and I may have been too hopeful for this outcome) the Amazon store would NOT accept the return at the location.  Instead I was required to drive to a UPS store to make the return.Along with this laptop I ordered a laptop fan to aid in keeping the device cool and performing well.  Since I was not keeping the laptop I returned this item right there at the Amazon store.  However, I was not allowed to turn return this broken laptop costing over $2000 in the same location.  This makes NO SENSE.  Why would a company that sold a product require the customer to use more third parties rather than its own agent/location in order to return it?  The customer service person on-site had no explanation.I drove another 9 miles across town to the nearest UPS store.  Just before it closed.  I re-initiated the return process via my smart phone.  Instead of being providing a scan code to provide to UPS... I was required to email myself, and the UPS store a copy of the shipping label, then pay the UPS store additional money to print Amazon's return label.The process was absurd.I was really looking forward to using this device as the online reviews (not necessarily Amazon's) led me to believe this was a great computer.  I do not know if the damaged screen was caused by shipment or a factory flaw.I do know that Amazon made this process difficult.  I will now be waiting for ""7 days"" to get my refund issued, so that I can find a replacement and it will not be from Amazon.I will not be taking the risk of buying high-end electronics through Amazon again.  At this point it may be better to buy directly from the manufacturer or a local store.UPDATE:  Between Amazon's absurd return requirements, and UPS incompetence, my time and money were totally wasted.  After two weeks of waiting, worrying, tracking and nonsense, I still do not have my money back for a defective product.  DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.  They are the 21st Century version of ""The telephone company"".  Too big to care.

  I have always wanted an Alienware and was happy to choose this one. When it works, it works very well. It's also beautiful to look at.The problem is my PC crashes all the time - generally daily. I get the dumbest errors like Hard Drive - Not Installed. Dell support is useless. They try to funnel you to automated systems rather than humans and leave you wasting your time until you get frustrated and give up. It's almost like they're trying to frustrate you long enough with crappy tech support that your warranty expires before you recover your mental health.

  I gave 4 stars Cus its wrong description. As same as the first man who reviewed this item. the description didn’t match the description in terms of graphics, only a 2070 rather than a super! (Originally it showed 2070 super, now it changed) the laptop is good, but can be better. It can run most 3A game smoothly. The temperature of CPU runs as 76 degree centigrade, but it will not decrease frame rate. Cannot feel pretty hot on the keyboard. The other thing I have to mention that I paid $24XX for the laptop. However, it has $230 off discount now. Ready to return it in a few days! Already buy another one from Alienware website, which is 2080s. Generally, I like this laptop, and it can be better!

  First the big big pro is the weight is way lighter than the old 15r2 way less that is great, the only con on this is that there is no metal frame anywhere.So far I have noticed the temperature and fans action when installing some games and primarily with the battery charger plugged in. I have not yet evaluated the battery usage, I will prefer the dark one but this was with almost 400 usd discount so I took it. This does have the 2070 super inside as advertised. I will review some more in a couple of months. But alienware is my preferred gaming brand of laptops.Also this does not have SB audio card nether the Klipsch speakers it is a sad thing but how can you light weight ?

  What else can I say?  I did nothing more than run the suggested Windows/Dell updates and play World of Warcraft.  The machine ran the game very well, though it did run a bit hot as other mentioned.  I experienced the occasional screen-tearing, and some weird hangs where whatever applications were running would stutter for about a second.  This is already behavior I had not experienced in another laptop, but I mostly ignored it.Then the machine bricked.  Just shut down without warning and would not turn back on... sad.

  Fantastic product, handles everything you can throw at it with ease. Beautiful screen, keyboard is nice and responsive as well. Only concern is the heating. To play some high end games at max graphics quality it is imperative to have it on the full speed settings for fan. CPU temps even with this sometimes high north of 100 celcius. Recommend buying a cooling pad for extended gaming sessions. Otherwise, 10/10

  This is the slowest computer I have ever messed with. I literally recieved this 40 minutes ago and have gotten so many unresponsive pages and had to force close them. I thought it was my internet even though it is running as usual. I was able to do everything I needed on my other laptop before this one even loaded the page I needed to be on.

  The Lenovo Ideapad 3 14 laptop is a very solid laptop and a must-buy for just $450.To start off with the pros,This laptop is very light, portable, fast, and powerful. I'm a college student going into I.T. and I edit videos a lot. The RAM, GPU, and CPU can easily handle that type of workload for 1080p video. The Ryzen 5 3500U with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics is more than capable of handling light gaming, 1080p editing, Unity/Unreal/Blender rendering, and absolutely blazes through everyday tasks.The keyboard has a phenomenal feel to it. While it's definitely no Thinkpad keyboard, it feels much better than most laptop keyboards out there. The membranes give a nice, tactile, solid feel to each large key, providing a comfortable, solid, satisfying typing experience.The 256GB NVMe SSD gives the laptop a very snappy speed, with a near-instant boot time. While the storage capacity is definitely not vast, it makes up for it in speed. The Ideapad 3 also includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, so an external SSD/HDD is definitely a viable option if you want more storage on the laptop. (it's what I did.)The 1080p display is crisp, sharp , and beautiful (if you spend some time color adjusting the screen in the Radeon settings.) It's definitely more than viable for watching movies, streaming TV shows, or editing videos in 1080p.Now for the cons,The Ideapad 3's battery is definitely not a poor one, but it's far from great. On max performance mode, I rarely get more than 2 hours of battery life out of this computer on full brightness. However, running this on the ""better battery"" mode barely sacrifices any performance for me, and I've been able to get a significant 4-6 hours of battery life when running that mode.The trackpad is a very smooth experience, yet moving your finger around on it produces a weird knocking sound occasionally, but I've found this to quiet down as the laptop is used more often. Minor gripe.I know a lot of people have complained about the screen on this computer, but honestly, it's far from a bad display. Sure, it only goes up to 220 nits (from my testing) so it can't realistically be used outside on a sunny day, but for indoor use, even in a bright room, the display is easy to look at and is bright enough to be very clear. Now, keep in mind, the screen comes with all the downfalls of a TN panel, with viewing angles being rather lackluster, but while looking straight at the computer, there's few displays you can get that beats this one for a sub $500 laptop paired with this powerful hardware.In conclusion,If you're looking for a good laptop for under $500 that doesn't look or feel cheap despite the (very solid in my opinion) plastic construction, this Lenovo is an absolute no-brainer. The Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 provides performance akin to laptops over double this one's price. If portability, power, and convenience are what you're keeping an eye out for, I can easily highly recommend this computer.Qualifications:- Information Technology Major-Computer Repairman for 4 years (both desktop and laptop)-PC system builder-Overall Computer EnthusiastThanks for reading my review!

  I normally don't do reviews but, if you're like me you also scoured the internet and found nothing on this laptop based on the model number provide or the pictures. There's conflicting information from the representative and the photos/specs provided so this is the specs as it sits in my hands.Specs:All plastic shellIdeaPad 3 14ADA05 81W0003QUSRyzen 5 3500u3 USB-A ports, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, there is no USB-C on this device. Do not use the answer from the representative as correct on this one. I even asked a more clarifying question and was told there is a USB-C, but you cannot charge over it.The screen is a 1920x1080 TN panel, no touch screen256GB NVME drive - no spinning HDD, so disregard the section that says 7200rpm on the description page8gb of DDR4 ram at 2400mhz3 cell battery - seems okay power saving options gives it roughly 8hrs depending on what you're doing and your tolerable screen brightness (but your mileage may vary)There is no back lit keyboard. The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it.Review:This appears to be Lenovo's answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU.Compared to my wife's Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that's not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the ""New"" model and $699 for a used model.Conclusion:If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you're getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait.If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point. Even if they come at a higher price point it will drive the price of the 3500u down.

  Note, there are 3 components of this REVISED review. The 1st regarding the product, the 2nd regarding the vendor. And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty.-----TL,DR: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. With a very low effort refurb process there appears to be a higher than average number of purchased units quickly failing, and the vendor fails to honor the warranty by providing false or misleading correspondence to warranty inquiries.-----1.) I admit I wasn't expecting much as far as the Chromebook itself. I was specifically looking for a decent, stable, used/refurb older Chromebook, modestly priced unit to use for testing, debugging, and experimentation in an educational environment. It is not my primary machine, so I didn't need it to be super snappy. This model is particularity geared towards the school/student market, so I figured it would be reliably sturdy. I was pleased to find that this unit was extremely clean, well functioning, and very speedy and responsive even beyond my basic needs. The only drawback of using an older refurb unit is battery performance. This one doesn't last very long, or hold a charge well. But I'm pretty proficient with this tech, and already knew that this battery design is only optimally rated for an approximate 18 month window, after which a steady decline in battery performance should be expected. It's just part of the territory. Replacing these batteries is not very complicated. Anyone considering a refurbished model that has more than a couple of years under it should consider doing the same. This unit (true to the model line in general) has sturdy, solid feel, a responsive and snappy keyboard, a clear bright screen, and nice audio.2.) As far as the vendor, I initially could not have been more satisfied. Not only was the price lower than I expected to have to pay for a modest refurb unit, but shipping was almost immediate, and FAST! I expected a 2-day shipment via Amazon Prime, but my delivery arrived less than 23 hours after placing the order. I don't live in an area where faster than 2-day service is typically an option, so this was an especially great surprise.--------HOWEVER.......3.) After less than two months of very sparse and careful use (a combined use of under 3 hours) the unit simply died, no longer booting up.After ensuring the battery was fully charged I applied the 3-key reset method (esc-refresh-pwr) and the screen flickered the ""Chrome OS is missing...."" message before pixelating into random lines and colors, quickly seizing up. Repeated attempts produced the same results.Being proficient with this tech (I am a Chromebook administrator on a school site) it was quickly evident the unit was suffering logic board failure. Presuming that any tech support will still want to go through all the paces, I still proceeded with an attempt to freshly install Chrome OS, but it continued to freeze, flicker and pixelate upon any attempt to boot up. A call into Amazon's tech support to isolate symptoms confirmed my diagnosis of logic board failure. This is despite having very light use of this unit for less than a total of 3 hours since purchase. I was not worried as the unit has died well within the vendor's 90-day warranty, and after having been so thoroughly surprised by their very speedy purchase fulfillment, I fully expected them to honor that warranty. However the several communications I have had with this vendor have produced confusing responses with no indication thus far that they will honor the warranty and replace the unit or refund the purchase.I initially notified the vendor regarding the failure of the unit, and hoped to elicit information about their warranty coverage. I also attached the transcript of the chat with Amazon's tech support identifying logic board failure. Their response was the following:""Your message has been assigned to me, and I am reviewing it as a high priority. I will follow up with you very soon. Blazing Prices is committed to your satisfaction, and I will make every effort to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. Thanks for choosing Blazing Prices!""Have a great day!Thank you,Blazing Prizes""That is all good and well, but I took note that their response did not include an actual service representative's name to correspond with the noted ""me"" in their response. An actual contact person is usually identified in context of following a ticket through a tech support chain. This was an early indicator of a pat automated response.Two days later I received a followup email that appeared similarly automated, but with the additional note that I should contact the manufacturer for warranty assistance, stating that the manufacturer has been notified of my query and that they stand ready to assist me.Now, at this point I knew that the response was laughably suspect. Not only did they not provide any identifying contact information about whom (or how) to contact ""the manufacturer"", but I knew for a fact that this manufacturer (Dell in this case) was absolutely not poised to offer warranty assistance for a 3+ year old 2nd-hand low-end Chromebook. In short, Blazing Prices outright lied.I responded to their email about ""the manufacturer"" to see what they would say if I I asked for more information about following up with the manufacturer. I received the above-mentioned automated reply.I knew by then that I would get nowhere with the vendor. Still, I have continued to follow up with additional queries in the weeks following. As I post this I still have a few days left within the 90-day warranty period. But each response from the vendor has likewise mirrored the previously noted automated response.They are not necessarily a scammer. They sold me a product at what on the surface should have been a very competitive price. If it continued to function at least beyond the warranty period the vendor would have met their obligation decently. However it is clear by my experience, as well as those of other reviewers, that this vendor has falsified some of the claims on the product page. They certainly are not able to account for the integrity of the product  - and in such cases that is what gives a supposed 90-day warranty its value - but this vendor also has shown no indication that they will honor that warranty - so having added it to the product listing constitutes fraud.I already have a tech support ticket in to Amazon regarding this purchase, and am following up with them regarding Blazing Prices fraudulence in skirting their warranty obligation.Do not purchase from this vendor.

  At first I was very pleased with the computer, but after one month it started flickering on the screen. I contacted the seller who responded quickly. After a few informational email exchanges, I have not heard back from him about resolving the issue. I was leery about purchasing a refurbished computer and now wish I had not.

  These Dell Chrome Books are really nice! We got them for our boys ages 13 and 11 for Christmas. They use them for homework and playing games! It’s one game that they really play that they can’t play on this chrome book because it doesn’t have windows. Rowblocks is the name of the game I think! Lol.... about two months after getting the books we noticed that they wouldn’t charge and they could only use them if they were plugged in. We contacted the company and sent them back and two weeks later they sent them out knew books. These are working great! Turns out the both of the books had bad battery packs. Customer service was great and I would definitely buy from them again!

  I thought that when you got refurbished that it worked. I had to replace the battery, the only way you could use this is if it was plugged in. It was also very scratched. Not someplace I would use again.

   This detachable magnetic keyboard two-in-one tablet computer is adorable in that it is so much smaller than any other laptop that I’ve owned. This Haobook106 has Micro USB port, USB3.0 port, HDMI port, DC jack, earphone jack, mic and TF card slot. It has a super thin 1280x800 IPS 10 inch high-definition touch screen display that works so effortlessly! Some of the specs are it has a 2GB RAM, 32GB of storage when support of TF card slot which can expand the storage up to 512GB! It has a very decent Camera 0.3MP+2.0MP (front and back camera). The battery is 6000mah and lasts me for days because it works so well.  The Operating system is Windows 10 which works like a charm on this device.My favorite aspect of this product is the detachable magnetic screen. It comes off so easily and quickly becomes a tablet for convenience of doing many things, but then it can fold up and be put away with added protection unlike most tablets that are exposed.I have a lot of future use in this product and look forward to experiencing it’s full potential. I would highly recommend this for a college student or for someone who likes and appreciates the multifunctional tablet to laptop capabilities. You must stay aware so that you do not pick it up by the screen because or disconnects so easily, which is a huge part of what I love about it. Just be aware.

  I ordered 2 of these tablet/laptops for my kids for Christmas. I was looking for a Windows based machine as the Google Chromebooks can't do some of the online games that they like. So, I researched and this one came up with pretty good reviews. It was a nightmare! First, just getting it set up was a pain but we got through all that and got the kids going. However, even though they weren't doing anything with major graphics or anything, the machines were SUPER slow. I have good internet and use multiple devices on it without this issue, so it isn't that. It was only slow on these machines. Additionally, it was so slow that many things wouldn't load or function at all. Really, just didn't have the capacity to do much of anything. I asked the kids and so now the laptops are on their way back in (For a $43 restocking fee per laptop btw). Cost me $86 for useless machines. Will never do again!

  We purchased this as an extra tablet to use with our label printer for our ecommerce business.  The sole use of this computer was to use the internet to generate shipping labels and then print the labels.  It stopped connecting to the internet after about 6 weeks and stopped connecting to the label printer (via USB) after about 7 weeks.  Extremely slow.  Honestly very painful to use especially considering we were only using it for one purpose.

  It stopped working and it over heats. The ROM and RAM is too low, and it frequently hangs. It’s keyboard is so small and gets jammed after 10 days or using it. I would rather go buy an acer or chrome book which costs the same price, rather than buying this China useless product

  Don’t buy it!  If you do, be very careful when opening it in “laptop” mode.  The tablet/top portion has 2 flimsy plastic tabs and one of them broke the 3rd time we used it.  Because one of the tabs broke, the top portion will not connect to the bottom/keyboard portion.  As such, it is useless.

   The days of paying $400 to $500 for even a entry level laptop is definitely gone. With these brands that are coming out, not only you can afford an entry level laptop for less than $300, they perform as good as some of the $500 laptops out there.This is one of the reasons why I bought a second laptop as our children are homeschooled and the technology seems to accelerate faster and the devices get outdated quickly. This laptop is very fast for its price range and it can do just more than light gaming as well as daily surfing and work-related tasks. The screen is nice and bright and can play HD videos and was able to play Roblox which seems to be very popular with kids nowadays without it lagging.The Wi-Fi also has the standard 5 gigahertz and 2.4 GHz antenna as well as Bluetooth connection so most modern devices will connect to this laptop perfectly fine. The surface area for the the touchpad is also large outside of using a mouse but it's nice and lightweight, it's thin, and for the price you can't beat it 😃👍

  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it! Shipping was very fast, and the customer service I received from HALF TIME was executive level. I would recommend this machine for anyone doing lite gaming, or any schoolwork.

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install. Everything is working as intended. I would recommend This Laptop. I like the auto on feature and the 4 digit pin login, makes it easy to get to work.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

  Revised: 05/29/21Laptop completely froze - non responsive keys, mouse, even Ctrl-Alt-Del non functional.Had to turn off and back on. All my windows were recovered at least, but this is concerning. Also noticed some periodic screen flickering.  I have not yet used this for any gaming or heavy duty processing - just emails and web surfing so far. About 30 hours usage since new.---Note there are 2 models - one with touchscreen, one without. The Galaxy Book Pro does not have a touchscreen. I currently have a laptop with a touchscreen and found I used this feature very rarely. It always seemed awkward on a laptop sized screen. I use my tablet when I want/need to use this capability. I've only had this Galaxy Book Pro a couple days, but so far am pleased with it. Amazing how light it is. And so far my downloads, internet work, and Office applications are performing better than any previous computer I've had (and I've had a lot.)  Screen is clear and bright. Sound is good. For my go to, everyday computing needs, I rate this 5 stars. I may even purchase one for my 90+ year old  Dad who spends much of his day web surfing. :)

  I did a lot of research before buying this laptop and I am extremely satisfied with it.  The only difficulty was with MS Windows needing to do a lot of updates before things stabilized but that is true for ANY new Windows PC.  Some of the online reviews had negative comments but I found them not to be a problem.  Here's some examples:  Some said the display was too dim but I felt that it was plenty bright in daylight or in a dim room.  Yes, there is some flexing in the keyboard but for normal typing it was not even noticeable.  The speakers, though not fantastic, I found to be better than I expected.  Granted that my previous HP laptop had up firing speakers which sounded better and the Samsung speakers are under the laptop body firing down but they sounded pretty good.  Based on the negative speaker reviews for the Samsung I was expecting the sound to be terrible but it was actually pretty good.  Another reviewer had problems with the Wi Fi speed he was getting but I ran a speed test and got the full speed I always get from my Wi Fi.The overall performance and graphics is very good and the light weight and size are excellent.  I had to wait a little longer to get the Mystic Silver but I really didn't want the blue one.  The wait was worth it!!

  The screen is amazing. Laptop.is extremely thin. Lightweight. Only con, is the the mousepad ""click"" is horribly loud and feels extremely cheap. Beautiful laptop. Very satisfied. Charges with USB type C 65w charger. Had a issue with the $100 gift card you're supposed to get but Amazon realized quickly.

  (5.20.2021)I feel I may need to update this review, for the 15.6"" Galaxy Pro i7, later at some point because currently I am not impressed.The display is nice, the laptop is lightweight and its performance seems to be quick - boot time is satisfyingly quick.It is the overall build quality that I am unimpressed with; the bottom of the laptop bows out a small bit.  Laptop body feels like cheap plastic - if you're purchasing this, get a protective sleeve for it.Samsung will be releasing a clear case for this at some point, but it currently is not available for purchasing.If you are not careful with how you pick up the laptop, the body can flex just enough to click the trackpad as if it were a mouse click.Only reason I may change my review is depending on the quality of productivity-levels I can get to with this as well as using a Samsung Galaxy S7+ to operate as the second monitor for the laptop.

  Coming from a Pixelbook, even after just 1 day of using the Pixelbook Go, I am finding that I prefer so many things about it, particularly the excellent keyboard, speakers, and battery life. The trackpad is also very good. The screen seems very good to me with plenty of brightness and good resolution for internet browsing, documents, photos, spreadsheets, and the like. I like that the Go is a bit smaller and lighter than the Pixelbook. It feels very solid to me, more so than the Pixelbook. It's a keeper for me. I have the cheapest version with the M3 processor and it seems perfectly fine for general use. I haven't run into any slowdowns yet, but I also don't do any gaming or video editing, just general internet use.

  Let’s be honest, a laptop is a laptop, at the end of the day not much to them except screen, looks and how it all is put together.  I have a windows pc for gaming, but when I want an easy to use all arounder I love using chromebooks.  I have a pixel slate but wanted a regular laptop for school work to take with me anywhere I am going to go.  Rather than go over another typical laptop review I mean there is really nothing I can add except tell you why I choose it over the competition.What I want in a laptop:  looks, good battery life, good keyboard, nice display, thin/light, reliable, good price and decent performance.The go versus:Asus 425/433/434:  these are probably the biggest competition in price, looks and performance,  The issue with the 434 is the lack of reliability with numerous reports for users. At 3.2 lbs it is kinda heavy, and the 433 has a cheap keyboard deckHp/Dell 14 inch:  I put these both together because they are similar and they both are very heavy approaching closer to 4 lbs.  To give you an idea my 15.6 gaming laptop weighs 4.8 lbs. The dell is not very attractive to me and more bland.  The HP is attractive but still heavy, not a bad choice, but not the best option IMO.Acer Spin 13:  very premium,  but more of an industrial design, also heavy, great performance though.  UHD display.Pixelbook:  probably the best alternative, and checks a lot of boxes but I find the large bezels very dated. Still expensive if you want to buy it new.Samsung plus V2:  another good alternative with a metal lid.  Under 3 lbs and not bad looking.  The bottom portion is plastic and it does feel like it.  Plain 1080p panel.The pixelbook go has a good 1080p panel which you don’t find often in chromebooks unfortunately.  Outside of the pixelbook the go is the only other one under 2.5 lbs.  It is also thin.  Slim side bezels.  Great speakers and keyboard.  The go checks all my boxes for a laptop perfect for this my masters program.When I first heard the go announced I was upset in the pricing, but then I compared it to the competition.  At regular price almost all the competition sells at $599.  The base pixelbook go that I bought is $649.  The go is $50 dollars more but compared to the rivals it has a leg up on build quality and looks with many of them.  Now most of the other laptops I mention they have been on sale for significantly lower than msrp so you might want to consider that.  There also is no fold-able display like many of the others, which for me has less meaning for the way I use the device.What google did was refine the basic laptop and wrapped it in a pretty bow, which is the same thing that surface laptop, macbook air have done.

  Brilliant laptop! The build quality is top notch and everything from the keyboard and track pad to the full HD screen is a very pleasant and premium experience.  I got the base model and I think for most people that's all you need unless you need more storage. Chrome OS is lightweight already, so the laptop has absolutely zero performance issues with it's configuration.  The battery is stellar, I'm getting nearly 12 hours before having to charge, and it has fast-charging capabilities when you do have to.  The only limitations are Chrome OS, which isn't a problem for me since I'm only using things like google docs and sheets for school. If you need programs for heavy photo or video editing or if you're planning to play anything more intense than an android game than this laptop isn't for you. But if you need a beautiful, fast and simple OS that allows you to answer emails, write a few documents and watch some Netflix with ease than look no further than this machine.

  I really wanted to love this unit but it's got a screen flicker bug and support is refusing to provide a timeline for updates.  As with most things google, if it works great, if you have trouble expect to get lost in a maze of different departments all of whom have no real answers.  You get the software when they deliver it and if there is a problem you wait months for them to resolve it.For those that might be using this as an alternative to linux.  There is still a lot of things you can't do.  You can't attach USB devices to the linux container ( unless it's android ) so things like Ethernet or other devices are right out.  You can't have inbound port access without 3rd party chrome apps which do port redirection ( and clobber the originating IP ), while they claim GPU support it's pretty lackluster at this point.  They are making movements to removing hyper-threading totally from the software which would be a 30-40% negative impact on performance compared to similar outfitted notebooks.EDIT:After nearly a month they appear to have corrected one of the flickering issues, the most annoying one at least.  Raising review two 3 stars for the time being.

  Want to sort some data in Excel? No.Want to open two Word documents at the same time? Nope.Want to right click on a misspelled word? JK. LOL. Nope.Want to save a file and then attach it to an email? Not today my man! (Note: There is a weird workaround where you can save things into the Download folder on the hard-drive and then attach from there. Otherwise it's useless.)I cannot begin to image what makes this an expensive computer. It is alarmingly difficult to perform the most basic functions. I'm a graduate school student and bought it for online classes. It fails so miserably that I have to do all of my work at the office.

  Very nice laptop. Had to turn off ""S Mode"" to install software other than Microsoft apps. Camera is good quality and output on Zoom meetings. Wish it had more USB slots so I had to purchase a separate adapter to get more. Plenty of RAM for what I do, great processor as well. Very light weight now that you don't get CD/DVD drive. Would recommend and purchase again. HP laptops are great quality.

  It is a nice external looking laptop, but I am really disappointed with its performance, it was bought for educational purposes, in order to give opportunities for low-income artist children in Venezuela to learn design applications, but from the beginning the computer came with pixels dead on the screen and unfortunately the processor has not been enough for tasks that our old i5 computers that we have if they could do. I hope in the future the HP brand can recover its prestige, at the moment we are considering buying another pc for next year

  I just received the laptop today and was very excited for the sleek design and touch screen feature.  However, after the initial set up is completed, while I and my wife were happily enjoying youtube movies, the laptop crashed multiple times for no reason - I made sure all the windows updates are completed (e.g.., accepted the windows updates and restarted multiple times). Made sure the laptop was using power cord, and also tried with a battery power only...  The symptoms are either the screen went frozen completely & no response on keyboard.  I had to press and hold the power key for like 10 seconds to force the laptop to reboot!!  Such crash happened like 8 times or more.  Frustrated!

  It is a great 2 in 1 laptop for the price. There are only a couple of issues. Firstly, the battery life is not as long as other high-tier laptops. Secondly, the graphics card also is subpar in comparison with other high-tier laptops. Nevertheless, these two aspects are to be expected from a mid-tier laptop. The touch screen is great, and also the cpu, ram and storage. It is a great product for personal and professional use. It needs to be noted that if you are into graphic design, the colors in this laptop are a bit opaque.All in all, an awesome laptop at an awesome price, 5/5!

  I purchased the above noted computer and used it a few about 12 hours over 6 days.  This morning the screen failed to come on.  At first I thought it was not turning on, but when I started to pack it into the box for the return, the laptop was hot.  I got it powered down and packed it up for return.I do not think this laptop was new.  The box had a shipping label from some distributor (not HP), shipping it to a Best Buy in NJ.  The Windows build on it was nearly a year old so I think it is likely this was a refurbed machine or it has been sitting on a shelf for quite a while and acquired by the Amazon seller.I'm out $100 as I paid to get the files from my old laptop transferred to the new one and had to pay for shipping with insurance.  I understand why Amazon doesn't include many of these laptops under Prime - I'm sure you can figure it out yourself.

  Well, here’s what 1000 nits looks like.I was expecting super bright, and that it is. Here are the positives of this laptop:  *Thin and light  *Virtually edge to edge screen (did I mention, it’s bright?)  *Plenty fast  *Fingerprint reader works really well  *Half a terabyte SSD  *Privacy share screen can be turned off (really dims display)  *Getting awfully close to Spectre quality  *Keyboard has short but good tactile feel  *About any sale $$ makes this a darn good value  *Charges really fast  *Backlit keyboard helps (low-contrast) keys  *Newer Iris graphics has a punchHere are the negatives (to me):  *Movable lower ‘lip’ on USB-A ports are certain to break off (but at least it has a USB-A!)  *Battery life definitely not 11-13 hours, but good (not sure what EVO was supposed to guarantee)  *No pen or HP leather case came with mine  *No advanced power option sucks (but that’s a Windows thing) so can’t adjust fan or stretch out battery  *That nice screen shifts backlighting emphasis as you adjust the screen angle (annoying). My Dells don’t do this.  *Dells just seem a bit more ‘solid’, but that’s subjectiveVery nice laptop—especially at this price level. I don’t do gaming, so I can’t speak to that. The ‘high’ is the screen—SO bright! The low is that screen—brightness ‘rolls’ in intensity as you adjust screen angle.

  This laptop is light and fast. The keyboard is responsive. Its backlit function starts working once you type, so I haven't had to switch it on to get it to work. the fingerprint function is very efficient. If you have difficulty getting all your print in for one finger as it prompts you, it allows you to enter print for another finger. Once you do that, your access every time takes only a moment. You can type and do a lot of work with it for several hours without having to recharge. The ports are accessible and there are enough ports for all identified uses. I compared its specifications with those of the same model at HP and the match was perfect. In other words, it's like ordering it at a much higher price directly from HP. I haven't used it for gaming yet.

  Como pro, es un modelo bastante practico por ser de 13"" aunque el panel dice ser de 1000nits. cuestion que no se ""siente"" realmente.  creo que es lo unico que me dejo un sinsabor. sin embargo, en rendimiendo, es brutal. se enciende en menos de 5 segundos, sale de invernacion de manera instantanea. el teclado es muy preciso y la retroiluminacion es suficiente.la bateria, algo que me tuvo con mucha duda. efectivamente llega a las 8/10 horas segun el uso (uso continuo)Materiales de muy buena calidad. y el touch no se raya ni ensucia con facilidad.lastima que no venga con el Pen.

  I purchased this laptop September 15, 2020 and received it on September 21. It took me a few weeks to get everything like I wanted it, and then in mid-October I started getting a black error screen stating that the cooling fan on the computer was not operating correctly. The computer would shut down and I could log back in with no issue.  At first this only happened rarely, then began to do it multiple times a day, and also the fan would make a very loud sound. I contacted HP Support and they arranged for me to send it back for repair.  I am pretty disgusted to have paid so much for a laptop and have to send it back for repair less than 3 months into using it.  I have owned several Dell laptops and never had an issue like this.  I'm not impressed with the laptop, but the customer service was #1.

  Well, the laptop overall is awesome!! For more details just go to the Asus page or Youtube.Now, for the hard part. I am currently living in Mexico and this model won't be available here and that is why I decided to get this laptop from a third party seller (more $) trough Amazon (+ import fees $ + shipping cost $). I know there are probably cheaper ways to get this but I decided to go with Amazon convinced they will handle all the paperwork and the import process.Unfortunately I was wrong. For my particular case, Mexican government has a set of rules called NOMs (Mexican Official Norms), and those apply for any foreign product with a cost higher than &1,000.00 USD. There are several NOMs a product has to comply with and getting the certificates is a rather long process that involves sending the product to a specialized lab for testing and a really long time waiting on the federal agencies for any response. The NOMs are in place to ensure a foreign product can be used with out harm within Mexican territory.While I was researching all these ""fun"" rules and their applications, I got to realize that they are aimed to the big importing companies. The ones that get a foreign product to be sold in Mexico, and in my case I am just a final customer looking to buy an awesome laptop.In my opinion, getting this certificates is the job of the ones like Amazon or the third party seller I got the laptop from: Michael Electronics; since they are selling and importing this product to a foreign country.I went trough a rather worrisome process where my laptop got hold on customs office for over 10 days. During this time I was in constant communication with Amazon and Michael Electronics and although they were super polite, they were NOT helpful.In order to get my laptop released I had to obtain an especial letter from Mexican government to exempt 2 (of many) NOMs. Surprisingly, Mexican federal agencies where extremely helpful and they got me the letter in 5 business days. I then submitted the letter to the customs officials and finally got my laptop.In summary:I don't believe this laptop should be sold by Amazon without the required documentation, the risk of the product getting stalled in customs offices is very high and there is no warranty that Amazon will issue a full refund (according to the representatives I spoke with). I could complain about the NOMs but foreign country laws are way out of our control and then again this is WHY we use big selling companies like Amazon. I believe Michael Electronics shares responsibility too but I also believe this is WHY they choose to sell their products trough Amazon. According to Mexican government agencies Amazon has A LOT of issues related to Mexican NOMs so to them: PLEASE, it is not a new topic and I am NOT the only one.For everyone looking to import this awesome laptop from America beware of what happened to me.Best regards!

  I won’t write a lot because it’s a great laptop with a competitive price!And for me it’s the best you can buy write now!About my expectations:1. I didn’t expected a small scratch from the back!Which seems that I could have got an open-box piece. And if that is the case, it would be a disappointment!2. The battery 🔋 has a long lifetime which is good of course. But if you were doing your research without trying the laptop your self, you could find that they were exaggerating a little bit3. I really didn’t expected that there are versions do not include anime matrix but that didn’t bother me anyway because I would not go for it with an increase in ( price, available date, weight, thickness and whatever small wattage amount it would take)4. Finally, webcam. The second day I received the laptop, I needed to make a video call. Guess what, I spent almost an hour to check where is the cam 😂I mean it would not bother them to add one even in keyboard like HUAWEI matebook d14 for instance!

  You get a ryzen 9, an rtx 2060 and a 1080p 120hz display, this is one of the combinations with the best performance per dollar. Out of the box, the PC worked perfectly for me without much tweaking, only problem I had was that it came with windows 10 home rather than pro, which for my case, needed an upgrade; hope it's possible to ship pro versions in future. For the power it packs, this pc is thinner than most, definitely not MacBook pro thin but not much thicker than it, which is a definite plus; it's also a lot lighter than my MacBook with markedly better performance - that ryzen chip trades punches with the i9 in the Mac and gpu performance isn't even a question - for meI also like the fact that the pc comes with minimum bloatware, I didnt have to Uninstall anything at the very beginning, it's a clean, well designed and properly executed piece of hardware, gold stars to AsusI love this PC but I objectively have two issues with it:1. The success rate of the fingerprint scanning-caching function is abominable - 6/10 times I genuinely have to enter my pin and 9/10 times I have to rescan my finger, usually a different finger to get through windows hello. I really hope that Asus has a fix coming in soon, if it's a software related issue2. The backlight for the keyboard is uneven and if you're in a well lit room, then it's easier to see the keys with the backlight off. In my case, I use it late at night when I really need the backlight but otherwise by default it's offFor price to performance, it's a buy, right now prices are going down due to the upcoming 5000 series cpu and 30 series gpu models, if you'd want to wait for those, absolutely - from the looks of it, Asus has made a great pc even better in 2021, but nothing would beat the price for last year's model.

  I really like this computer. It is powerful and can run programs I could never run on my previous laptop. Just two main complaints...it does not come with a built in camera...that one is my fault as I should have read the details more closely but cameras are such standard issue that i did not bother to search that one out...second, the keys are nearly impossible to read at certain angles...it's like they purposively sat down and determined angles at which the markings on the keys would just disappear...it is not horrible as I am a touch key typist, but there are times I need to read the keyboard and this laptop is just not very friendly on that aspect...great computer otherwise...haha

  EDIT: Ya i got a bad model, but IMO Microsoft has more than enough money to make a laptop reliable especially as its competing with the most reliable laptop brand there is. The surface laptop isn't bad but it's not worth a thousand dollars or more when your own phone will likely out-live it. Also for the same price you can buy a laptop with almost twice the specs. Save your money don't support them and they'll have to get better if they want to compete.Update: it took about a month but they contacted me back. I have received a refund.  I will never purchase hardware from microsoft again. I will only support them through ms office and xbox. These laptops are too much design and way too little quality (minus aluminum case.) Expect a working model to work for only 2 years.Brand new started up kinda laggy and glitchy then suddenly I go through the start up process and change my wallpaper and everything seems kinda odd and slow for a brand new device.. so I go to restart it in a proper manner and boom. Now the screen glitches out and you cant do anything. Once you're able to log on with mininfreezes every 3 seconds and screen blinking, the desktop is empty and wont load any icons or even the task bar. Will stay like this for minutes and do nothing but blink on and off, and then most AMAZINGLY return to the log on screen. I lightly tap the underside of the laptop and notice the screen flicker more as I do it. It's like the hardware is so close together its touching and shorting out everywhere. I was hoping that microsoft would build laptops that actually do compete with apple but a quick google search shows 25 percent failure rates in microsoft laptops within 2 years, compared to 10 percent apple (leading competitor for qc and the surface laptop in my opinion.)

  I got the matte black lowest configuration 13.5"" for productivity purposes only. No gaming. I do plan on uploading a review video on my tech YouTube channel in case anyone is curious to know my user experience. But as the title says, so far so good, no issues. I will give it more time and will adjust my rating on this product accordingly if anything changes. The only thing that bothers me which also seems to be a common complaint regarding all surface products is the random adaptive brightness that you can't turn off. I've browsed many forums and other sources for solutions, people going as far as editing the registry... you should not have to jump through that many loops to toggle this display feature. Microsoft, PLEASE GIVE US THE ONE UPDATE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT. Other than that, I do like everything else about the Surface Laptop. Because I can't give half a star, I'm going to give 5/5 hoping Microsoft can just fix this one issue.

  Works good no problems. Matte black will show fingerprints easily but I don't care if you do get a different color. People complaining about the laptop being ""laggy"" need to change the power saver mode to performance the laptop auto sets it to save battery life which will make the computer slower. (This is on all Microsoft laptops now and has been for awhile) I would not recommend this for gaming thats not what it's intended for its a work laptop. If you want to play games get a desktop.

  Love this product. I got it in Matte Black, and I was expecting much worse for the finger print issue. This is very light and doesn’t bother me.I also have not experienced any lagginess as shown in other reviews. I have the i7 version.My screen does change brightness automatically from low to high without change in room, which is annoying but will get fixed soon hopefully.Overall, very stylish and capable, the keyboard and trackpad feels nice and I love the format of the screen (higher than your regular 13”).Also love being able to charge it with USB C!

  Buying this laptop was a bad mistake. I bought it in Jan and did not open it until late Feb / early march, I now realise that not opening it and checking the computer as soon as I received it was a huge mistake. When I did open it about 4 weeks later I realised it was faulty and now I'm stuck with the laptop as the refund option has disappeared from my Amazon purchase history.Upon turning on the laptop I noticed a thin blue vertical line on the left of the screen. I tried to find a solution on Google only to discover that the likely culprit is a hardware issue either with the display or graphics card. Today I logged into my Amazon account only to realise that the ""return/refund"" button is no longer there, so I am stuck with a new laptop that has a blue line down the screen. I tried to do a screen capture to show the blue line but the line does not appear in the screen capture, so this to me indicates that its the LED itself which is faulty. I have never heard of or seen this before. I decided to take some picture with my phone, here you will see the line, it looks black in the photos but its actually blue.Amazon or seller please help as I need this laptop replaced or refunded.

  When a mouse is plugged into a USB C hub the laptop just can’t handle it. The mouse lags and jumps around. Other laptops handle the hub fine, so I tried another hub and the same issue persists. Seems like I’ll have to plug it in separately, defeating the purpose of USB C.

  This is a very good laptop that is very capable of AAA gaming at high settings. It was packaged well with seals to prevent any kind of tampering during shipping. Included was a very basic, but free neoprene sleeve for the laptop. There are no straps or pouches but it is soft and will protect the laptop during travel better than if it were left exposed, but I would still suggest getting a carrying case or a backpack if you do plan on being portable with this. Also included was an HDD upgrade cable and screws in case you want to add a your own 2.5'' drive to the empty bay on the motherboard.The 1080p 3ms 144hz IPS display looks great and also has great viewing angles. If you've never used a 144hz Panel before, you can never go back to 60Ghz monitors for gaming again. 144Hz ruined my last gaming laptop because the difference is extremely noticeable (in general, it feels smoother when you move in games) compared to 60Hz panels. The webcam is passable at 720p. It's fine for chatting with friends or zoom meetings but not recommended for anything beyond that. It also cannot work with Windows Hello. The 10th gen Intel i7-10750H 6core 2.6Ghz base clock speed processor is very efficient, powerful, and has decent integrated graphics (which the laptop will prefer to use when you aren't playing games or doing any kind of intensive work that would require more GPU power). There's a lot of value in this laptop given that this CPU alone is sold for $400 and the laptop also has an RTX 2060 6GB. The RTX is the newest architecture that has the ability to do ray-tracing. If you don't know what that is, it's realistic lighting effects that developers are putting into games now, but you need a card that has the ability to process it or you can't take advantage of the feature.The RTX 2060 GPU is very capable. My average FPS with very high settings on Assassin's Creed Odyssey was 70. In GTA V on high settings, it was 115. Interestingly, this laptop has a button called Turbo. Now, there's no overt explanation for what it does when you take the laptop out of the box and don't read the manual, but it essentially overclocks the GPU for you and kicks the fans into hyper-drive to compensate for the extra heat involved with overclocking it. In terms of performance, on the two games I tested the FPS on, it gave me an average of a 10FPS increase. It is noisy though when the fans are on full blast. I have to give credit to the fans which Acer advertises as ""4th Gen AeroBlade™ 3D technology"" and the thermal management of this design because even when the CPU and GPU are being stressed, the laptop stays at a reasonable temperature, and by that I mean you can game with it on your laptop while sitting down without it becoming too uncomfortable. Aside from the Turbo button, there's also a Predator button on the keyboard. Pressing this opens an application that shows you the current temperatures of CPU/GPU and even ambient temperature inside the laptop itself overall. You can customize your lighting profile here, overclock your GPU with 3 speeds (normal, fast, extreme), and you can set your fan speeds to a custom setting or leave it on automatic. Because Acer has this application that controls these settings from OS, the UEFI BIOS is pretty sparse. You can't customize voltages or do any kind of manual overclocking, but since the application does all that for you, and many gamers don't overclock their system because they think it might be too complicated or risky, this makes it easy to do so with a simple click of the turbo button or drop down menus in the application. Speaking of the BIOS, you're going to want to go into it (spam F2 when the laptop is powering on), and disable the annoying POST sound. By default, when you turn the laptop on, it plays a sound file that sounds like a jet engine firing up for some reason. I turned it off because I found it incredibly annoying, but I'm thankful the option to do that existed in the BIOS. Other than that, there isn't a whole lot of customization to do in the BIOS. It also has WiFi 6! It comes with 16GB of RAM (two @ 8GB) but the DIMMS are user serviceable so you can put 32GB (two 16GB) if you wanted to with no issues.The OS comes per-configured somewhat, using performance metrics for the OS (such as not using the Aero theme). There is some bloatware which I recommend removing.In terms of build quality...this is where the laptop starts to show its low price point. The entire laptop is made out of plastic, and it flexes really easily, especially the panel. The plastic trackpad is just OK, it will function for web browsing and light tasks but it's not that responsive overall. The two small cutouts for the sound underneath the laptop is a really bad design flaw I wish more laptop manufacturers would get away from. Please just include top facing speakers. The speakers themselves are already not great, so when they're shooting downwards it makes it even harder to hear some games even when the volume in game is at 100 and the operating system volume is also at 100. For this reason, you'll want headphones to go along with the laptop.The ports available are:Left side--Kensington lock, RJ45 ethernet, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, 3.5mm audio jackRight side--Mini-displayport, HDMI, USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port (gen 2 adds charging capabilities even when the laptop is powered off), and USB-C using 3.2 Gen 2.Behind--Charging port. Kudos to Acer for putting the charging port in the center behind the laptop.Acer rates the battery as being up to 6 hours, but don't expect to do heavy gaming on this laptop while you aren't plugged in. I got about 2 with some minor downtime between games.One thing I want to talk about is the design of the laptop. It does look good, but I think Acer needs to think about the type of person buying this laptop. It's going to be mostly students who want a gaming laptop that they can also use to bring to class. I don't think that gaming laptops necessarily need to look like ""gaming laptops"". A more subtle design and the removal of any kind of LEDs on the exterior of the laptop would appeal to a much wider audience in my opinion.Overall, this laptop is an incredible deal. For what you pay, you're getting an incredible capable gaming laptop

  I bought this laptop as a last second mobile CAD workhorse (I'm an Engineering Technician). I did a TON of research on laptops close to the $1K mark that were also prime available on amazon. There are a few configurations of this laptop on Amazon, this being the entry level RTX version. So far, I've been blown away by the build quality and performance of this Helios 300. ACER has been my go-to for reliable computing for awhile now. Let's get to it:PROS:X2 M.2 slots for storage PLUS a SATA bay for even moreRGB zoned keyboard (and a great feeling one for gaming / everyday tasks)BIG vents on rear and sides, PLENTY of intake area on bottomThe thing just looks awesome, props to the design team for making a gaming laptop that looks professionalPredator sense UI is clean, loads quickly, and easy to useWith ray tracing on I saw around 60 fps on COD war zone with settings maxed.Not so much CONS:Fans get loud under load, but they react quickly and bring temps down FAST. It's an RTX machine, what can I say?Audio could be improved, especially BASS... but you've read this before with any laptop ad I know you'll be using headphones for gamesPower connector is in the rear center, you have to account for hardware layout here howeverBATTERY LIFE - probably the biggest complaint here, I would have absolutely spent an extra $100-$200 for better battery life if possibleSTORAGE CAPACITY - Would have liked a configuration on Amazon with 1TB + of this amazing nvme SSDIncluded case feels nice, but should have an extra pocket for the power brick (considering you'll almost always need it)All in all a lot of this goes without saying, but what is worth repeating is that this computer has 100% exceeded my expectations. This is the laptop to get mid-late 2020 if you want a 10th gen Intel chip and RTX. Thank you ACER!

  If you’ve heard of the Helios 300 then you’ve heard it’s one of the best, if not the best price to performance machines you can get. For $1,200 you’re getting a beautiful 144hz/3ms 1080p display that’s very crisp and looks great. The aesthetics remain similar to last year’a model with the exception of the back vents look way more aggressive, very nice looking. It has in take slits above the keyboard for increased cooling. The 10th gen intel and rocking a 2060 or 2070max q depending on your configuration. Well, let me get to the meaty parts. Easily upgradable, non soldered ram, dual channel, WiFi 6 non soldered, two nvme slots and one 2.5 SSD slot. The cooling is PHENOMENAL. I was going to repaste but I wanted to see how it performed with factory paste. Well, the highest it reached was 91c and dropped down to 88c immediately. It was averaging 80-88c while gaming for over an hour(far cry 5 max settings). I will repaste just because I like tinkering with my stuff, but the average user not need worry about this. The GPU stays even cooler. Those intake slits they added above the keyboard makes all the difference. Let’s see what else... the sound is good, typical laptop speakers, use a headphone. The material feels very nice. It does not feel like a “budget” gaming laptop at all. In a sea of overpriced gaming laptops with similar or higher price tags, this one is truly the winner. Also, I know ryzen is great, and you’ll read all about “8 cores vs 6 cores maaaaan!” I went through 3 ryzen laptops. While the extra cores and threads were nice, they’re meaningless for gaming, especially when they run slower and hotter.

  This laptop has a lot of bang for the buck.  I searched for a long time and have not seen another laptop with this price that was loaded like this.  Every other laptop had something that made it not as good.  When I got it, it exceeded my expectations.  It's fast!  It runs all of my games at the highest settings.  I love it!

  When I received this macbook and turned it on for the first time, it displayed an error message indicating that it was not able to find the mac operating system. I'm not sure what happened but I ended up having to call amazon who then transferred me to apple who then transferred me to someone else at apple who the had to talk me through reinstalling the OS. Overall, I had to spend ~4 hours of my life trying to fix a problem that this product shouldn't have had in the first place. I'm not sure what happened but I am extremely disappointed. You would think they would check to see if the OS was on the laptop before sending it out. But maybe I'm expecting too much

  So I was hesitant to buy a refirbushed computer but it arrived today and I am so happy I did. I read through the other reviews and checked all the negatives first. USB port works, runs fast, its 8GB as listed, not a scratch on the computer. Not one scratch!  No issues with set up. Camera works. Doesn’t come with extra long charger cord but description did not say it did. I’ll update again in a month but for the price you cannot beat this! Mine looks new. :)

  Bought a Macbook Air for my son - supposed to be refurbished and ready to go.  His current laptop died and he needed a new one urgently for college.  This one arrived on Sunday and when he booted it up it was showing that it was still under remote management of some public school system.  No way any quality control was done on this laptop before being shipped out - it would not even boot to a usable state. Extremely disappointed - had to send him to best buy to buy a brand new one on Sunday for an extra $250.

  Arrived with many distracting scratches or something in the middle of the display. Little black marks that won't come off. 90 day warranty says they won't accept returns for ""cosmetics"" so I figured we would just have to deal with it. I spent about 7 or 8 hours transferring all of my gf's nursing school stuff from the PC to the MacBook. Today, we discovered that we can't sign in to iCloud, iMessage or FaceTime (even with a valid Apple ID). After several hours of trying troubleshooting from the internet, we caved in and called Apple support.After about a half hour on the phone with them, they found that whomever ""refurbished"" this macbook formatted the SSD incorrectly. I had to completely erase the SSD in order to reformat it to the correct format. I lost all of that time spent transferring yesterday.....but it gets worse. After having erased the drive, reformatting it and trying to ""restore"" it to an older OS so I could properly upgrade it, it bricked. I now have a $700 paperweight that I can't return.

  Nothing much to complain about really. It's good. Just felt suspicuous about it. Like it felt like someone was trying to track where the computer went or something. The blue tooth was left on and the laptop turns on as soon as you lift the top up. I found that wierd. Very weird.

  Yo he tenido laptops HP que me han durado pero lamentablemente en esta ocasión no tuve la misma suerte con este modelo y proveedor ya que desde el primer día tuvo problemas con la actualización e inicio para ingresar al sistema. Toda esta semana he estado llamando a soporte de HP y no se ha logrado resetear el sistema por lo que decidí iniciar el proceso de reembolso y devolución. Ha sido mucho desgaste mental en lidiar con una laptop que se supone que al ser nueva debe trabajar óptimamente. Solo espero que la resolución de reembolso y devolución termine bien con Amazon ya que el envío de devolucion desde Costa Rica costo mucho dinero por lo que ojalá este comentario llegue al proveedor que por supuesto no lo recomiendo. Ya lo pensaré bien en adquirir otra laptop desde este medio ya que se complica la devolución. Así que les recomiendo que compren con calma.

  I have had good luck with HP computers and this is not an exception. All hardware features seem good, though Bluetooth is sometimes flaky. Though not specifically an HP issue, on the down side MS Windows is too insistent that you use their browser, login to an MS account (why?), and download only their apps. Funny, I thought I paid for Windows when I bought the computer but I guess MS believes they have the right to nag the user forever.

  I bought this machine to run Linux and did not wait long to install the latest Ubuntu 21.04. It works well and so I proceeded to upgrade it to 16GB memory with modules I already had as well as with an extra disk drive in the form of a 2.5 inch SSD to complement the built-in NVMe SSD. After removing the back cover this was easy to do and I am perfectly happy with the result. Couple of warnings, though:* battery life under Linux is poor. I cannot comment on Windows but I get only about 3 hours of usage out of it before I need the charger again. I turned off Bluetooth and activated the 'power saver' setting in Ubuntu. I have not yet played with other power management options in Linux as these tend to be more involved.* Because I need to run virtual machines, I decided to try and upgrade memory to 32GB. Some websites suggest the machine can take this. I was aware of the risk that it would not work and only proceeded because I had another box that I could stick the memory into. Turns out that with 32GB installed the machine would not proceed past the power on self test. It reports memory issues with two orange blinks followed by four white blinks of the power LED. The memory works find in another machine. Btw. Dell documentation states 16GB max and question here on Amazon says it is 8GB per DIMM slot.* I made the mistake of booting into Windows once and connecting to the network. After this I tried to install windows in a VM using the license key from the BIOS (can be extracted under Linux, google it). Microsoft's crazy policies foiled the attempt. If you buy this and intend to run Linux better never boot the pre-installed Windows!Things I like about this laptop:+ matt display, which has a decent 1080p resolution that works great at this size+ extensibility, will add more storage later on once 2TB SSDs are more affordable+ Ethernet port!+ plastic case is actually not as flimsy as some reports made it sound+ pretty good value for moneyThings I don't like:- sound is thin and for video conferencing a headset is needed - business laptop!- USB 2.0 port only on the right-hand side.- can get pretty warm underneath - this is an Intel/AMD box after allHope this helps.

  The laptop my wife used mostly was starting to show its age.  The power cord was looking twisted and like it was going to fail, and came out of the laptop way too easy.Then recently, my wife was getting prompts that CHKDSK was running when she started it, and sometimes ran for about 10 minutes before she could use it.I'm a retired IT guy, so I calculated that with the age of the current laptop, its processor speed, RAM, video etc., that it was time to get a new one.My wife does some web searches, eMail, and plays some card games, so we didn't need a gaming computer.  This one is very affordable, and even folded, it's half as thick as her previous one.With that said, this is far from a business class laptop.  It is worth what you pay for it, but that is not a bad thing.  The processor is good, plenty of RAM for her needs, fingerprint logon (she now loves), and a solid state drive (no moving parts).The monitor is nice and bright and very easy to read, even in our sun room.  Battery life is about 3 hours.Also, understand that there is not a CD/DVD drive in this computer.  If you need to install something, you will have to put it on a thumbdrive from your desktop or other computer.  If you know networking like me, I just shared a drive on my home office PC and connected to it.This comes with Windows 10 Home.  You can go into the System settings and you can do an update to Windows 10 Professional if you need an OS that you can connect to a work network.  Price for that is $99.Everyday since we got it, my wife has thanked me for getting this for her.  That may not seem much to some, but from my wife, that's a homerun!

  All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it’s clean, and it’s perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details.

  This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it.

  When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time.

  It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks.

  Really enjoying the duo screen for my graphic design needs. Very helpful for keeping and viewing multiple documents or pages simultaneously. Video rendering time much improved with this device. Only thing I'd like to see improved at this time is battery performance, although I do get a few hours out of it in performance mode while rendering or saving large files before need to plug in again.

  I was so hesitant on purchasing this laptop because I never had any Acer equipment. I am beginning a work from home and needed a laptop with an Ethernet port. I’d seen many laptops without an Ethernet port and a need to purchase an additional connector. I did not want to do this. Eventually, I came across the Acer Aspire 3 that had all I needed! It’s was delivered extremely fast; much sooner than expected. The set up was fast and easy. It looks and works great!!! No complaints as of yet.

  I use it primarily for internet, video, audio and Office. Multiple web pages load quickly and the Intel processor is slick.  Battery test shows it at 100% capacity.

For gaming I read it runs games from 2016 and earlier just fine.For my purposes it's an excellent value.

  When the computer arrived we unpacked it.  Came back later to set up and found the cord missing.  Thought maybe like printers, it doesnt come with.  So I left a three star rating.  Then the seller connected and said it did come with and it was misplaced on our end when unpacking.  So sorry for that initial bad review.  I like the computer.

  Okay wow! I am so pleasantly surprised and so glad I took a chance. Even if I received a faulty one, I could just exchange for another but based off of negative reviews I was still a little nervous. This laptop is nearly perfect! Hardly any scratches, none that are even noticeable unless you’re looking for them. Keys work perfect, battery power seems great so far. Seems like a brand new laptop for a fraction of the price. Win, win

  I was very concerned about buying a refurbished item from Amazon, but after received the MacBook Air yesterday I have changed my mind. First of all let me tell you the item is in great condition, small scuff and dins in the back due to the normal use, display in excellent condition as Keyboard and trackpad. Battery hold the charge for 4 hours, better than expected and described on apple website. I was able to upgrade to IOS Mojave last night without any problem. I've bought a Mosiso plastic hard cover with Keyboard cover for $13 as you can see in picture. In conclusion, despite some bad reviews I can say I got an amazing Macbook for a very good price, that means an excellent deal was made, so I recommended 100% and you can return it anyway if you are not satisfied. Happy customer

  Best equipment I've ever purchased.  MacBooks are very expensive and I cannot afford a brand new one.  I am beyond happy!  the response time on this refurbished macbook air is so much faster than my HP laptop.  I don't think I'm ever going back to a windows based platform

  Item arrived in blank discreet packaging and was well packaged and well protected.  The physical appearance and condition of this MacBook was as close to new as could be and the performance the same.  There was not one scuff mark, scratch, smudge, or dent whatsoever.  There were two factors that gave away that it was refurbished--battery life doesn't seem to last as long as it should which at this point is not a huge deal, but within 6 mos to a year, may become problematic and require a battery replacement.  This isn't a huge deal for me because my husband and I own an iPhone/laptop repair shop and if need be, can perform the replacement of the battery fairly easily and inexpensively.  The second is that if you look really closely, it appears possibly that the screen had been replaced due to the rubber around the outside of the screen being slightly out of position and when you open it up, sometimes there is a lot of play and is a tad bit loose only at certain angles, which might actually be normal for MacBook Air laptops.  This is my first MacBook so I don't know much about what a brand new one would perform like but far as I am concerned, this was a 100% success and I couldn't be happier with it! I would highly recommend this product by this JemJem Renewed seller to anyone looking to purchase a Next-To-New as possible refurbished MacBook Air or Mac product but not willing to pay retail or Brand New price for it.  It is a great bargain and I would definitely purchase it again from there-in fact, I probably will never purchase a brand new Mac product if I can get the same item or similar item for a fraction of the price and basically same condition.

  Love, love, love this new laptop.  I work from home, and needed a faster, more reliable computer.  It is the best HP laptop I've owned so far.  The keyboard has the numerical keyboard also, which is a must for me.  Fast loading files, quick internet connectivity,  beautiful screen resolution.  Also, the red color is a matte red that reminds me of my favorite Christmas ornaments.The price was well within an average person's budget, believe me I shopped around for days before deciding on this one. I do not impulsively purchase electronics, my last HP laptop was 10 years old.  It's still working, slowly and updates are not working.  My last cell phone (Note 3) was 7 years old.  Upgraded that to Note 9 finally.  Point being,  I expect my electronics to last.  I normally don't write long reviews either, lol.  For what it's worth, I really do recommend this laptop.

  The screen color is hard for me to see even when I change the settings due to being too light on the website I use for work.

  As a writer I wanted space for my works to be saved on and this is amazing for it. It fits all of my programs and is really easy to set up. The battery life is amazing so far and the screen is bright and easy to read from (and I love that I can adjust mood as well as brightness). It's thin and compact which is great because I can fit it in my bookbag, no problem.I got two of these; one for my friend. It is a beautiful piece of machinery and is very recommended; the touch or regular. It is worth the money, it shipped to me fast, and the computer was wrapped tight, so no scratches or problems. Now the only issue I have is speed, but because most of it is for my writings that's not a big problem.

  I am happy enough with this laptop; it is fine for my needs. However, I had no idea what ""Windows 10 S mode"" meant. Now that I have used it awhile I am not 100% sure I like the ""S mode"". It does have it's pros and cons, so read up on Windows 10 S before you buy this computer. You can turn off the S mode and run full version of Windows 10, but there is no going back if you do.

  The specs said 8GB RAM and also specified 2GB Graphics memory.Actual - 4GB in a slot and 4GB soldered.

  I just received this laptop so I'm just giving my initial thoughts. So the weirdest thing about the Vivobook is that the speakers are on the bottom, so the sound is muffled. The keyboard has a ""soft touch"" in comparison to my HP laptop. Personally I like the sounds of a clacking keyboard. The graphics aren't as crisp as my HP but it's not horrible. The number pad is rather slim, so the home and end prompts have been added to the 7 and 1 key (hopefully I explained that correctly lol). The battery life is alright so far. I've only been using the laptop for roughly an hour and 15 minutes and the battery is at 55%. Essentially this wouldn't be a laptop to travel around with without a charger.  The laptop feels sturdy, not enough to drop on the floor and it is okay but not bendy. Laptop is quiet but how long that'll last when teleworking is to be seen. There isnt a lot of heat either in comparison to my HP. So I'll update as time goes along***UPDATE 7/10***So the laptop is not charging past 79%... Weird. Very possible I'm the only one experiencing this but better let y'all know just in case it comes up again****FOLLOW UP****Sooooo there's a mode on the laptop that can restrict charging to either 80% or 60% 😂. That's weird but I guess it helps the battery. The option can be changed under MyAsus****April 26, 2021****Failed Wifi card and glitching when multiple applications open, so this is not heavy duty work friendly laptop. Fan is constantly running. Fine for light work and light gaming. The monitor isn't strong. Working on a tractor trailer there are bumps on the road and the monitor just flaps around.

  Overall I think it is a good laptop. The fan is a bit noisy but other than that a perfectly good laptop. However, mine had intermittent errors, similar to the ones I read in these reviews: the computer would BSOD with a hard drive read error occasionally when I turned on the computer. Other times it would crash with a memory management error. I think these errors occurred maybe 4 to 5 times since I bought the laptop.But I decided to return it since a new computer shouldn't be giving BSODs, and that it would probably only get worse as time went on.Here comes my advice, if you get this laptop, be sure to take a picture of every BSOD you encounter! When I returned the laptop as defective, the sellers tried to hit me with a 20% restocking fee. They denied that the laptop was broken. Luckily, I filed a claim with Amazon and they waived the 20% restocking fee, but if Amazon made me appeal the claim, I would have had no evidence to back up my claims of a BSOD. If you buy this laptop, save the original box and packaging with the anticipation of needing to return the laptop in 30 days. Also, know that the sellers are going to try to stick you with a restocking fee, and they aren't going to believe you if you claim the laptop is defective, so please document every error.Maybe I just got unlucky and you won't have any problems with the laptop, but know that this was my experience and the sellers were hard to work with.

1,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"ASUS VivoBook 15 Thin & Light Laptop, 15.6” FHD Display, AMD Quad Core R7-3700U CPU, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 10 Graphics, Fingerprint, Windows 10 Home, Slate Gray, F512DA-NH77",$689.99,5,"
  I bought this laptop (Ryzen 7) for watching streams and gaming. I have a desktop, but I wanted something I could bring with me for when I had to dog sit or not be at my desk. Since I knew I would be gaming, I opted for the slightly beefier Ryzen 7 over the Ryzen 5. It will only net you around 7 extra fps on average, so the jump isn’t all that necessary.The screen: matte, slightly muted contrast, but unfortunately dim. I’d say it only gets to about 75% of the brightness that I would like it to get to when I am in a fully lit room. But I really appreciate that the colors aren’t over saturated, it has a nice natural feel to the colors. The bezels are awesome, and the panel is sturdy.Gaming: So far I tested 1 game, American Truck Simulator. I bought this laptop to play games from early 2010’s. You do have to keep your expectations in check. This is not a laptop that will handle 1080p gaming at 60fps medium settings. I wanted something that could handle 1080/720 at around 45 on med/low. This will do that. You can watch videos on YouTube of Vega 8/10 graphics to get a good idea of what you will get.Speakers: they get loud, they aren’t tinny, but they are on the bottom of the laptop. The sound profile will change based off of what the laptop is on. Headphones/speakers are not necessary for this laptop, the speakers are high quality.Cooling: Very, very good when on a desk. Fan noise is very acceptable as well.The fingerprint scanner is quick, although I find myself going over it a lot trying to use the trackpad. The trackpad is very large though and tracks very well. The charging cable is incredibly portable, however I think most people would find the cable too short. All of the bloat ware was easy to remove, including mcaffee. The webcam isn’t anything special, but it’s over the screen which is great with how small the bezels are. I think for the price, this is the best laptop a student can get if they want to be able to do some gaming while waiting for classes to start. AMD is killing it with their integrated APUs, however do know that both the R5 and R7 use 2 gigs of RAM for the Vega graphics. Meaning if you have 8 gigs you will only get 6 gigs of useable ram. But you can get an 8 gig stick for 50 bucks and replace a 4 gig stick in the system to have 12 overall, with 10 useable. Having a powerful integrated graphics is worth the loss of 2 gigs of Ram in my opinion.

  Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop.

  The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe.

  This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend.

  Great, responsive seller, however, the screen on this particular chromebook is disappointing. If you're going from a Samsung Chromebook Pro there's no way you'll be able to live with this screen. While it's technically HD with the 1200-whatever by 720p, the font at any size magnification appears blurred and the the color gamut is washed out.It's important to note-- as I've just found out-- that there are more than 1 model of the x360 14b. This one is the one with the n4000, whereas Costco is currently carrying the n5000 one with the higher resolution of 1080x1920, and that's the model I'm waiting on.I don't know why HP released this one first, and while the screen is the sole feature that makes this unusable to me, it is still notable in that it's the first chromebook 2-in-1 to come out that actually includes Bluetooth 5.0. I'll update on the other model, which is only moderately higher in price.

  HP Chromebook X360 Model 14b-ca0010nr. If you're cheap like me and take FOREVER to upgrade things because, ""Hey, the old one works perfectly fine (although it's slower than snot and your kids say, ""Hey mom, you're laptop is a POS!"") Awesome HP Chromebook X360 for the price (snagged at $300)!  Totally suitable for the average surfer, email checker, movie watcher. NOTE: There are several variations of this same Chromebook that look nearly identical but are very different!  This WHITE keyboard one gives it away that it's the cheaper model! This one (14b-ca0010nr ) is not the higher end one, does NOT come with stylus pen and does NOT have backlit keyboard, has 4GB RAM vs. 8GB. Chromebooks DO NOT have Windows 10 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel - but you can still work with & save these files in your Google Drive), so keep that in mind - It's an App-based system with internet & keyboard vs. a traditional PC laptop or Netbook. Still, I absolutely LOVE this thing!  It's beautiful! Nice size 14"" screen, quiet (no fan, like in a PC), easy to transition to (especially if you already have a gmail account), user-friendly, a cinch to set up - took me less than 30 mins.  Only drawback I can see down the line is the white keyboard might get grungy (get a keyboard skin for around $12.)  Another NOTE:  I have an ancient printer that is NOT wireless and it won't work with it.  Most wireless ones will work, but check to make sure your printer is supported before purchasing! Highly recommend transitioning from a Windows based PC to a Chromebook for the speed and ease of use! Go watch a couple of ChromeUnboxed YouTube guy videos and then Buy it, already! UPDATE Aug 1, 2020: You can get the all white one now for $260!

  I am in grad school and I was looking for a Chromebook to use for basic web related research and most importantly for writing papers.

  I simply could not look at this screen. It was either too bright or too dim and the resolution was not sharp at all. Practically blurry. Also, the touchpad was loose, that's the only way to describe it. When you put your finger on it, it clicked and you had to press quite hard to get it to react. Overall, this was a very cheap feeling machine. I know, it's inexpensive, but I guess I expected more from HP, from which I've always found good quality.

  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  The laptop is okay.. it functions well enough for my kids online school. However we’ve had 2 of the 3 charger cords stop working and customer service was not helpful at all. They made me send videos and photos and then stopped messaging me all together.. very poor customer service. Would not advise purchasing unless you’re prepared to do the repairs yourself.Edited to say that the company did replace both chargers after several weeks of going back and forth, shipping was a month long, but they did make it right which I appreciate.

  I got this for my mother to replace a 10 year old Asus laptop she had been using. If there had been a 16GB model available here at the time I would have gone for that she does some photo/video editing, but it can be upgraded easily enough I suppose. That's not really a ding against this model in general though, since I'm sure there are 16GB versions available.Over all this laptop is great. It's sleek, the touch screen is responsive and it folds easily. The fingerprint reader seems reliable and unlocks the system fast. The camera is quite good for a laptop in this price range. The keyboard was easier to type on than expected, considering it has a 10-key off to the side. The speakers are above average for the form factor, but not something I'd listen to music on for extended periods. Battery life seemed fine in the small amount I tested it.For the cons, it does come with a few things installed you may not want, like McAfee privacy and antivirus stuff. I didn't have to spend too long removing bloatware, but there was a little. I'm not a huge fan of the USB port on the left side. It sort of ""folds open"" like a lot of laptop ethernet ports you see on thinner designs. The screen is only 1080p, but let's be real that's not really a con at this price range or for anyone that won't really utilize higher resolution because of eyesight issues. Aside from that there's not much to change. I'd love another USB port, but after using this for a day while setting it up, I'd be happy to have one for myself.If you're planning to use this as a tablet, maybe rethink that. At 4lbs+ it's still too beefy to carry around for that kind of task.As the headline alludes, performance is great in general. The NVMe drive is a nice step up from even your normal SSD, and having 6 cores that can boost up to 4GHz for some better single threaded performance is nice for a little laptop in this price range. If you're a light to moderate user just needing to do web surfing, email, excel, youtube and maybe some light photo editing, this model with 8GB of RAM is going to work really well for you.

  Stay away until HP acknowledges and fixes the audio issues plaguing this laptop. No matter which VOIP program you’re using (Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Messenger, Google, etc) this laptop will lockup with a horrible buzzing noise and freeze. I spent approximately 5 hours uninstalling and reinstalling drivers with HP support without success.  It’s a huge issue that’s not being acknowledged by HP. As of 9/24/2020 this laptop is still unusable. Stay far away from this laptop and save yourself a headache... especially if this is for work or your child’s digital learning.

  Product is exactly as advertised. No issues so far. It's exceptionally fast and has plenty of hard drive space for an everyday user. The battery life is great and the overall construction seems sturdy!

  I purchased two of these for my sons’ online schooling. On the first day, I had to reboot it four times because of audio issues, and once it rebooted itself. The second one froze twice, and programs won’t recognize the audio nor video. This is all in one day. I’m really annoyed.

  Loved this laptop - until my daughter starting using for school - Google Meets and the audio went out.  Started w/awful buzzing noise and now the microphone doesn't work.  Took it into local computer repair, had the drivers updated, but the microphone still does not work.  We bought it for her to use for school!

  I got this to be a secondary computer for me (I have a desktop) for work and on the go. It seems to be very functional for it's price. The SSD boots very quickly and RAM always seems adequate. I am only running MS office and web apps, so nothing too tough. Battery seems reasonable. A plus that it has a number pad.Edit: I also am having similar audio issues as other on here. I assume its a driver issue. I will edit if figured out. For now demoting from 5 to 3 stars.

  HP KNOWS ABOUT THIS MAJOR PROBLEM AND SITS IN COMPLETE SILENCE.  I bought this laptop as a gift for my wife who is earning her Master's degree online, where ZOOM/Skype/MEET online conferences are de facto. This computer arrives with a driver conflict issue between the Bang & Olufsen audio driver and the AMD graphics driver. This conflict causes the computer to suddenly freeze up during any online meeting within minutes, emitting a loud buzzing sound, ""...when the audio crashed the speakers kept producing a loud buzzing noise (like a snippet of noise repeating itself ad nauseam)"", (a comment from the HP support site). It makes holding online meetings impossible; in order to ""fix"" the problem one must perform a hard reset. Due to the COVID pandemic people have had to turn to work-at-home situations where Zoom/Skype/MEET online conferencing is essential. It's a BLACK EYE ON HP for KNOWING about this problem and continuing to sell the laptop, which is NOT CHEAP by any stretch of the imagination; not offering a working solution to the problem, and in fact telling customers that the product warranty does NOT cover this driver issue. OF course! Think HP wants to cover the cost of actually fixing all of these defective laptops, or in the worst case scenario, replacing/refunding the laptop. If you need verification about my commentary, please, I invite you to type into Google ""hp envy 2020 mic causing freeze screen"", and you will see the truth of the matter from hundreds of HP customers who, like me, trusted HP to be a good company.

  This laptop is extremely loud high pitch whistling sounds. It will give most headaches even bothers pets. People comment even over the phone about the sound it makes. Still runs uncomfortably hot. No drivers on Razer Support so forget about changing the SSD. No mouse drivers seem to work after reinstall. Cheap RAM and stock NVME drive no longer Samsung like years before. Chinese branded. Speakers are still terrible sounding even with THX “enhancement” software. Keyboard mushy and shallow. Performance isn’t that great either nothing special here. Get a warranty if you must buy I have a feeling it will be needed down the line. I’ll most likely be returning the system I got. To many compromises for high price. I’ve had 2018 and 2019 models and they all seem about the same returned all of them. I really wanted to like this laptop.

   I thought that the 2018 Razer Blade 15 was also defective due to high-pitched noise when the fan rotated at high speed, but this product in 2021 was even worse and headache with a terrible noise like a whistle as soon as the fan started to rotate.Currently, due to the influence of Cobid-19, it costs a very high shipping cost of over $ 400 to return, so I can not return it, but I would like to repair it.

  It's important to know what you're buying when you purchase this. It's a very thin laptop packed with all the latest hardware and display tech, at least the model I purchased. There are thicker 17 inch plus beasts out there, made out of plastic with better thermal performance. It performs extremely well for gaming given its compactness, it handles my office and video and photo editing with ease. It DOES run hot under full load, and a laptop cooling pad with fans is ideally necessary as the base can get quite hot especially against the skin. But I bought this for it's aluminum shell and portability, packed with all the latest technology. It does what I need it to do well, but, understand this comes at the cost of thermal performance without external cooling. The display is perfect in color and response, the 3080 accomplishes any task I can throw at it even at only 85w. The chroma lighting is beautiful and the keyboard performs well and is pleasant to use for office tasks. The audio with THX is quite good given its size.

  This is my second advanced model. I was excited to give the new 30 series cards a go and went with the QHD 240hz, 3080, 32gb ram etc. Like another review said it failed to boot when first turning on so I had to f9 and use razer’s factory recovery... then after about an hour finally got it booted. Once booted it’s fantastic...but yes horrible first run experience. Just plan on having to hit f9 if you get an error when first powering on. Secondly, yes the fans are loud - I don’t care as I use Astro headsets... lastly, yes 60hz really is all you get unless you’re gaming then you can use 240hz.. there are work arounds to keep it in gpu only... but not really they want I want to use it... would also be nice to have DP to DP to drive an external monitor at higher refresh rates... thunderbolt to DP or mini DP to DP is fine but I can’t find a cable that supports higher refresh rates. Overall I’m happy though. Really happy. Small upgrade over the 2020 advanced but I still feel it’s well worth it. Hopefully razer offers amd soon so battery life will be improved.

  I was pumped about this laptop, the cnc'd aluminum case and quality components had my hopes up! The machine arrived very well packaged and looked great. But, brand new and out of the box I couldn't even get the machine to turn on. Many startup failures later I navigated my way to recovery mode and reset the laptop to factory settings. After factory reset I was able start windows for the first time. Horrible startup experience. (thank God this didn't happen after using the machine for a while forcing me to loose documents etc.) I am very weary of this machine and considering returning it to save myself the future headaches it will most likely cause. If it cant start up straight out of the box how can you expect a machine to flawlessly startup after use?

  So yes...I did buy this one because it's pink...and it's so pretty!  However I am overall pleased with this purchase.  It does everything I expected it to do.  I haven't had any issues with it yet and I've had it for over a month now.  I typically prefer Acer brand to any other, but because of the color, this HP won out.With this laptop I am able to stream videos, watch live TV, and my son games on it. (Minecraft, Pokemon, etc.)  We can skype, zoom, and facetime with no problems.  It does the job and fulfills my needs.My only complaints:*I do wish the sound was louder*It had a card reader for camerasBut other than those 2 minor details, I'm a happy camper!

  I was surprised because usually HP computers are the best in every way. However, this computer was gave me trouble from the first time I turned it on. It would cut on and off by itself.

  New chrome book is shipping with the camera privacy switch off. It’s on the left hand side. There was no manual and we couldn’t figure this out even with customer service help Hope this helps others. Simple once we found it. Nice feature but HP needs to document it because it’s tiny. I’ve never had a Chromebook ship with the camera off?  Not our first chromebooks, and previous HP didn’t have it.  Maybe I’ll post a review once we’ve used these some.

  Bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter since  she has virtual school this year. I thought she could use it for school and download her games on it. I did not realize that a chromebook  is mainly for internet browsing.  It does not have  the Microsoft platform to download her games. Keep in mind I am 75 and not that computer savy. My son-in-law said he did not have enough computer knowledge to set it up to be able to download her games. Unfortunately  I did not read the return policy before ordering this. I would be charged a 20% restocking fee if I returned it.  I would  be out over $100 and not have anything.  I feel forced to keep it. So Buyer  Be Ware. Don't make the same mistake  I did.  😣

  If you're looking for an inexpensive computer that does it all.  This is it.  I did alot of research before purchasing.  I've had it for a few weeks now.  So far, I am very pleased. Literally everything is easy on this computer, including set up.  The speakers give quality sound.  The screen is excellent and not as dim as I was originally lead to believe.  The battery lasts all day.  It has 8gb ram so I can video edit when I am ready. You don't have to remember any of your passwords because Google Chrome does it for you. Downsides: when u flip the screen all the way around for tablet mode, the speakers become muffled because they are on the keyboard on the other side. So far, no one has made a protective case for it or a keyboard cover to fit it.  The keyboard is a little bit weird because it has a search button instead of caps lock.  And the whole screen button doesn't actually make your videos go full screen.  It just enlarges the window all the way. It is an overall high quality product that I am very glad I purchased and look forward to much productivity.

  This computer is great. Having worked with an Acer Chromebook for the last 5 years, I knew what to expect. I love Chromebooks for their ease in setup. It literally took 5-10 minutes to set up and I was already doing work. I was worried I would miss the 15.5"" screen size of my older Chromebook, but I don't. The screen is clear, the touch screen works great, and I love that I can flip the screen over and use it as a tablet if I choose. The keys are sleek and types faster than my older Chromebook. The computer is fast and really lightweight. I would purchase it again and highly recommend it to others!

  Very well built,  great touchscreen, good sound (for a laptop), and excellent keyboard.  Screen is average at best.  Specs are good, except internal storage.  64G is considered very good by Chromebook standards, but most people will need more.  Luckily, that problem is easily solved with a micro SD Card.  In short, Chromebooks are pretty much maintenance-free (software-speaking), and are fantastic for most simple functions, but they won't replace a Windows or Mac computer for anything other than web browsing, multimedia, and light gaming.  Also, the 64G isn't upgradeable or replaceable except by using external storage, which is lower quality and much slower.  It's ok, but there are cheaper and better values out there.  One more thing: if you plan on using a printer, do your homework.  I was able to get my Canon Imageclass working on it, but it was a great big pain!  HP printers tend to work much better out of the box with Chromebooks.

  In terms of specs, features, and performance, I'm generally finding this Chromebook an upgrade compared to prior Acer and Samsung models used for business purposes.  There are two problem areas that result in my present rating.  First is discovering after multiple orders and returns that there are no available keyboard covers or hardshell cases that fit.  Also, the keys are audibly clacky and could potentially be picked up via the microphone during videoconferencing.  Be sure to read current questions and answers before investing in this model.

  I was very excited to receive this laptop. It was a total disappointment.When I started, there was a squeaking fan noise. The noise is good enough to annoy. Then the keyboard is too warm to feel you uncomfortable.I called customer care. They asked me to upgrade bios. After upgrading, fan noise reduced and squeaky noise vanished. However, keyboard was too warm. Even after cooling down, when I try to open, it gives the uncomfortable heat to the keyboard.Why do you even sell a laptop with bios not upgraded and defects?Return service also disappointing.

  I bought this laptop for music storage, social media, surfing and storage and editing photography.  I don't do any graphic intensive games, so no comment there.GOOD: I do like the screen size and image quality, touch screen, storage, RAM, keyboard, SSD startup times, backlit keyboard and slim design.  I think the price is consistent with those features.  It set up pretty easily.  Its slim.  It seems quick.  If not listed below, I suppose I'm happy with it.BAD: - Screen brightness change.  This freaked me out until I went online and found how to disable the adaptive screen.  I need a consistent accurate screen editing my pics.  Even disabled, I still see a brightness change slightly after I load an image.  I've done two support chats with mixed experiences.  I'll forward and check the images to see if my editing is accurate.  If so, I suppose I can live with the pause.- Oven.  I actually use the laptop in my lap.  I almost cannot use it plugged in due to the heat.  It needs better cooling.  Looking on-line, this seems to be a Dell design issue on some models.  The solution list, other than keeping it lint free, are all about non-lap surfaces and maybe cooling pads.  Um.  No.- Ports.  While its a little nice to be able to charge from either side, these little ports basically work with no USB/HDMI/SD without adapters.  There are 2 little ports that can charge or use an included adapter to USB.  There's a micro SD that fits none of my existing camera SD cards.  If I'm charging and cooking my lap, I can use the USB adapter for one accessory.  Very limiting and adapters are an expensive hassle to my exiting blue-toothless devices.On balance, for the money, I would say the features balanced by issues makes it pretty OK.  I can't compare it to competition, but I'd say if you use it for long in your lap for photography editing.. and you have full size SD cards.. check out the competition.

  Overall, I am very happy with my Dell XPS 13 9300. The trackpad and touchscreen have excellent sensitivity, the webcam and keyboard are of much higher quality than my previous laptop (admittedly, a much cheaper Lenovo Ideapad) and the screen resolution and color reproduction, while not world-beating, are more than adequate for all but artists and graphic designers.Having 16gb of RAM has made a huge difference in running multiple browser tabs. As a middle school teacher working remotely, I need at least 20 tabs running simultaneously to teach a class online, several with videos queued up. Gone are the awkward delays and freeze-ups that would sometimes plague my previous 8gb machine.I should certainly mention that my XPS 13 stopped working entirely after 8 days - so why the four-star review? I couldn't have been more impressed with both Dell and Amazon customer service; the prompt return calls, careful attention, allowing me plenty of options (repair or replacement) and ultimately replacing my laptop the very next day. It's a fact of life that complex machines can break; it's what happens after that in my opinion is most important.So, why not five stars? This new computer comes with the latest version of Windows 10, which is far more intrusive than I've experienced before. For example, there is no way to stop Cortana spying on you, disengaging Skype has become much harder, and installing the latest Dell drivers was made more challenging, in part because of changes to Windows firewall and bios. Specifically, it took almost two days of troubleshooting to diagnose and remedy an issue with the speaker driver - during which I was without sound.Nevertheless, my overall impressions have been very favorable and wholeheartedly recommend this laptop.

  The unit arrived quickly but 48 hours after I set everything up it froze. Simple forced reboots don't work, had to factory set. After having to do this 3 times I called and Samsung agreed its an issue.bi sent it back, they received it. It's been a month since they received it. Over and over they promised to send a replacement. After weeks of this, and getting the tin around, they finally said they would refund my money if I could provide a receipt. I did. And a week later still no word it's been issued. Nightmare experience.

  I purchased this item spur of the moment during a lightning deal when then price was dropped to $329. Normally I don't make impulse purchases at that price range, but within ten minutes, the deal was 98% sold out, so I just took a chance and went for it. and boy am I glad that I did. I'm upgrading from a Lenovo C330, which I also like very much (especially for the sub $250 price I got that one at) but you're getting a lot more bang for your buck with this Samsung machine.** Just as a heads up, this is an updated model of the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 than was what was launched a year ago or so. (There's a video on Youtube that explains the differences -- which is not much. This is a lighter silver color and not the sleek, darker grey.) **I'll break my review down by features:- display: For the price, this display is incredibly sharp. Like, surprisingly nice. My other computer is a 2017 Macbook Pro and I can honestly say that this one is almost on par with the retina display on the MBP. For me personally, display is always the most important single item on a working laptop as low pixel count, resolution and bad colors can lead to severe eye strain and fatigue. This machine doesn't come with Chrome's Night Light feature out of the box, but you can activate it (search on Google). In the past, Chromebooks were known for being very cheaply built computers with low quality components, but I'm very impressed and equally happy with this computer's display, especially for $329.- keyboard: This is where Lenovo and others have Samsung beat. The keyboard is fine, but the keys themselves feel quite small and there's too much space between keys. I feel like I have a much quicker and accurate typing experience on virtually every other keyboard. In terms of layout... It's just your standard Chromebook fare. I will say this is probably my only real disappointment with the machine. The trackpad is also fine. It's nothing spectacular, but doesn't feel particularly cheap. All gestures and two finger scrolling works no problem and there's a nice solid (and quiet) click when pressing the trackpad.- battery life: The battery life is pretty bonkers on this machine. After a couple of console prompts, the battery capacity is shown to be 39 watt hours. This is a huge bump from the Lenovo C330, which already has incredible battery life. My guess is the larger, higher res display necessitates the additional battery capacity. I've not been through two full cycles yet and have been using the machine all day for work during the day and then Youtube/Netflix in the evening. I think it's safe to say that you easily get a full day's worth from a single charge even with lots of video and graphics-heavy use.- speakers: They're not that great. Most computers at this price point have downwards-facing speakers, and this one is no exception. The speakers don't ever get that shrill or rattle, but in terms of overall volume, they're not very loud. I ended up using headphones for a couple of video seminars I had to do today because the speakers were just not loud enough.- cameras: I haven't tried them yet. I don't really use webcams on computers and don't see myself using the cameras on this one much.- build quality: This is a tough one to measure for a few different reasons. It appears that the slate gray Plus V2 has an aluminum/alloy case, but this one is all plastic. It feels sturdy enough, but definitely has that plasticky feel. The keyboard in particular is where it feels especially cheap. But even with a full plastic build, there's really no keyboard or display flex, and the computer feels solid in my lap or on a table. The screen hinges are also pretty sturdy and stay put when you're banging away on the keyboard.I've got to say, even at $400, I still think this is a solid buy. If you're able to grab this during a flash sale for $350 or less, then definitely go for it!EDIT: After only using the machine for a couple of days, the GPU/CPU/internal graphics went completely haywire out of nowhere and the computer became completely unusable. Trying various resets didn't work and opening the display to tablet mode and back didn't help either. The replacement machine is also flickering, giving me the impression that these newer silver models have a major issue with the stability and reliability of the graphics and display. There are a few others who've posted similar issues in their review of this computer here. Still debating on whether to keep it or not because I really want to like this computer but am worried about what happens after the return window and warranty period expire.

  I wish I could rate this a full 5 stars, because I honestly do love this Chromebook. As a broke college student, this was pretty much at the upper end of what I could afford as all my classes required me to use some aspect of a laptop, and I was getting annoyed at just having a tablet. I did pay full price for this, and I've had it for a few months now so I feel I can leave an accurate review.One of the first things I noticed when booting up the laptop was the screen. The screen is absolutely beautiful, and I don't know how Samsung delivers for such a low price. It is not the highest resolution by any means, it is after all a Chromebook, however you can barely tell unless you're staring at the screen an inch away (which I do not recommend for the sake of your eyes). The touchscreen works well too, and I've never had any issues with it. The second thing I noticed was the keyboard, and I'll be honest, this keyboard is on par with higher end laptops. It doesn't feel cramped to me at all and my typing speed is just as fast as it was when I used a hand-me-down Microsoft Surface Pro 4.Let's talk about the body. The whole thing looks like it's one unibody piece of aluminum, however only the top lid is metal. The entire bottom part, including the housing for the keyboard, is plastic. The bottom of my laptop already has scratches from me moving it around on a metal table, which isn't a deal breaker but it does mean the structural integrity of the bottom is slightly weaker than it would be if it was all metal. The speakers are also on the bottom so it can be muffled if you don't slightly prop it up on something (though the speakers actually sound pretty good and get loud enough to hear outdoors). Again, for the cheap price, this doesn't really bother me. The other hardware impressed me as well, with 2 USB C ports, both of which are on the same side, one standard USB port, a headphone jack, micro SD card slot, and physical power/volume buttons.In terms of software, this obviously runs Chrome OS and it does, as specified, have Intel Celeron. Not extraordinarily fast but I rarely notice it lag unless I have excessive tabs open. It has 4gb of RAM and mine has 64gb of memory, which I have yet to run out of. Then again I don't download a lot of things on here save for papers and a few apps, and the papers I delete as soon as I turn them in. No major complaints here.The pen. Ah the pen. I use the pen for math notes, as my teacher uploads PDF files of them for each class. The sensitivity levels are fantastic and you can get super thick or super thin lines with ease. It feels very natural, and palm rejection works well (given that the app you're using includes palm rejection). I have also used it for a little doodle for another class, and that all worked just as well. The pen conveniently fits into a slot on the right side with a satisfying click so you know it won't fall out.That being said, let me talk about the things I'm not quite as fond of. Being a Chromebook, I knew I would only be getting Google Play apps and I was prepared for that. Luckily, this laptop does have the Linux Beta, meaning if you know how to work a Linux system you can download apps outside of the Play Store. I was able to download Steam and try out a few games, however I have never gotten one to run anywhere near smooth enough to make an enjoyable gaming experience. Oddly enough, I have tried Don't Starve both on Steam and on Google Play, and the version on Google Play runs infinitely better. It was made specifically to be played on a portable device so it is less task heavy, however I have a sneaking suspicion that Steam in general just does not work well on a Chromebook. Again, not a deal breaker for me, but something to be aware of.Finally, something that bothers me to no end and is the entire reason I took off one star. I haven't read many other reviews of people experiencing this, so I wonder if this is something wrong with my laptop, however it is SO SLOW to start up. I have to open the laptop at least a minute before I expect to use it, because it takes forever to wake up. Another issue is sometimes when pressing the power button on the side it doesn't do anything, and the only loophole I found to that is pressing the refresh button along with the power button. This is actually really annoying, and I don't understand why the button doesn't work 100% of the time. Still is not a deal breaker for me, still not a reason to return it, but it is rather annoying when dealing with this every single time I want to wake the laptop up.Overall, I do absolutely love this Chromebook. I never thought I'd get used to using one, however this laptop has proven me wrong. Minus the ding for the slow start up speed, I honestly would recommend this to anyone looking for a little portable laptop or an entry level one for school.

  Ordered this but received a cheap, older model worth half the price, although I was charged for this device. Not sure who was responsible for the mix-up, but I'd be very careful when ordering. I really was looking forward to giving this as a gift to my daughter but was completely cheated by its arrival. Returned the cheap model for a refund.

  This laptop has been my first new laptop since around 2012 when I bought my Dell Vostro 3460 so it has been a long time since I had a new portable thin and light. Let me just say it has been too long! I bought this for the powerful specs and amazing value! So far it has surpassed my expectations! The Ryzen chip flies through windows and the Samsung 512GB m.2 SSD makes the computer boot to windows in mere seconds. The integrated GPU, Vega 7 works amazing and can play rocket league with great frame-rates. The sims 4 plays well too if that is more your thing. I have used this for a little over a week now and it has been a wonderful little device to use. Battery life is strong on the settings I use which is msotly battery saver stuff to just run office and write emails, so it always lasts me through my work days. The fingerprint scanner is a life saver with windows hello integration. The privacy camera shutter is an amazing feature every laptop should have. The trackpad is a good size and the keyboard provides a reasonable amount of feedback but it is a bit shallow for me coming from Dell laptops it doesn't diminish the typing experience too much it is a breeze to just fly through emails on this thing. This device would be perfect for students who want something portable it also with plenty of horsepower for the more complex applications like the adobe suite of applications. Although the display is a bit dim, its pretty color accurate and gets the job done. plus with pen support where can you go wrong? I'm honestly surprised this thing hasn't gotten more coverage in tech media for its outstanding value and great quality. I'm very happy with this purchase and I think you will be too. if you are in the market for a laptop that has the best value for buck, this is unmatched. only being edged out by the Acer Swift 3, but keep in mind this configuration specifically has 16Gb of RAM rather than 8 so it should last longer in heavier workloads. 10/10 would reccomend.

  You can see so many YouTube videos saying what a hot deal this is... and it IS!I am generally using this as an office adjunct, some light video processing, and some home utility funciton.I do not have the Lenovo pen or any other active pen so I can't speak to that.  But what I can see is that it is well built, solid feeling, and quality functions.  I can utilize the installed Microsoft Suite and OneDrive sync quite nicely and was able to buy a 2nd pin style power supply so I do not need to depend on the USBC port to charge this device.  I recommend it also because it is a single 'wall wart' and not a 2 piece brick style supply so makes travel a bit easier for me.The track pad works fine for me (after a little adjustment) and the battery can pull me through a couple of days of light office work.  The screen is just fine indoors and the touch function works great.I tiny wish is that it had a USB port on each side... but that is a minor nit pic... not a deal breaker. I am glad for the HDMI full size output for work and display functions.The screen swivels back all the way into tablet mode and woks great.  A small note though of tablet mode.  This does have a fan so will make some noise under load.  AND it is a little bit heavy to use one handed as a note taking clipboard. It is fine for short notes or lists but I would not want to carry it all day in tablet mode taking notes.I did have 2 'glitches' .  The closing of the lid should power this unit down.. but I find that sometimes, when I open it up later, the cursor doesn't appear back and I have to reboot it.  And the track pad.. if you touch the very sides, it will not move the cursor.  I am not sure if this is a feature or bug..  But I feel software updates should fix this.

  This model is 81X20001US. It compares to the 81X20005US, Available on Amazon for $599.99. Only major difference between the two (besides the Amazon or Costco exclusively) is the addition of an included stylus on the Amazon model.Ryzen 4500U vs 4700U256gb vs 512 GB storageReally, for $150 more, it makes a pretty decent machine under $1000 into a powerhouse. This is not going to win graphical awards, but may just be the highest end spec on a sub $800 laptop on the market.I read lots of reviews. I hear that if you get a unit that performs less than expected, exchange it immediately. Apparently, some believe 1 in 3 Lenovos are faulty in some manner and should be exchanged. Do the research and take the time you need to make a decision right for you and yours computer consumption needs.

  It was a shame I didn't end up going with this laptop. The keyboard is just too sub-par compared to lenovo's own thinkpad lineup. The spec on this machine is insane, it rivals my main desktop computer which was top-tier for it's time only 3 years ago.But the fact AMD is not seriously considered by manufacturers (yet) means that the few options to get this god-tier CPU are in trash-tier chasis like this one. It's not overly cheap, but it's definitely not $900 worthy. The keyboard is just too unpleasant to type on for me. Maybe for most it will be fine, but if I kept this thing it would be docked 24/7, and then what's the point of a 2in1 at that point?It was close, but I ended up going with the L13 thinkpad just because of it's far superior chasis and keyboard.

  Let me start with this first, I like this laptop and I think it's a very good buy.The best thing about this laptop is the big 17.3"" IPS screen, it's sharp with good viewing angles and decent brightness.The 11'th gen Intel CPU performs very well, everything loads very fast and it handles multiple tasks with ease.Wireless connectivity is also great, connection is fast and stable.The speakers are decent for a laptop, OK, nothing more.The keyboard is good and spacious but I wish that the keys were bigger, there's a lot of space in this laptop to fit larger keys like CTRL, ALT etc. and especially the small up/down arrow keys are requires more attention because I find myself hitting the shift key when trying to press the UP arrow key or the UP key while wanting to press the DOWN key.I am also missing a light indicator for the Caps&Num lock keys.The touch pad is large and comfortable to use, responds very well.Battery life seems decent, I haven't tested it too much but it seems you can squeeze out at least 4-5 hours of work maybe more if you use lower brightness.Regrading ports, you get 2xUSB3, 1xUSB-C (5gbps), 1xHDMI (2.0), 1xRJ45 LAN, 1xUSB2, 1x3.5mm audio - good but I wish Acer had included Thunderbolt 4 since the 11'th gen Intel processors support it.One point I would like to raise is the lack of (any) technical information regarding this laptop, no detailed specs regarding RAM, NVMe SSD drive besides the size, no technical info, upgrade parts, IPS panel color gamut specs etc.I wanted to upgrade the RAM and I could not find any info which RAM this laptop has and what speed it's running.So for other potential buyers I want to share what I have found:This laptop comes equipped with 8GB DDR4-2666MHZ dual channel memory (4GB soldered on board + 1X4GB expansion module).This seems a bit odd to me because according to Intel specs the 11'th gen I5 and I7 supports DDR4-3200MHZ, so I can't figure out why Acer used lower speed memory ?Who knows, not a deal breaker but little bit disappointing and I wish that this info was written somewhere for potential buyers.The 1 memory module you can upgrade is a Kingston 4GB DDR4-2666MHZ model: ACR26D4S9S1KA-4 .I wanted to upgrade the RAM to 20GB by replacing it with a 16GB module and I also wanted to preserve some of the dual channel functionality by utilizing Intel's dual channel ""flex mode"" because the memory modules do not mach in size.So I have bought the most similar spec'd 16GB DDR4-2666 module I could find locally made by Kingston model: KVR26S19S8/16.Installed the module and the laptop booted with no problem, identified the new RAM properly and also enabled dual channel - great but again I wish someone had written what compatible memory you need to buy in order to upgrade.The 512GB NVMe SSD installed is made by Kingston, you can also install an additional SSD for more storage.Acer included a bracket mounted inside the laptop with a cable already connected and you also get a bag with 4 screws to mount the additional SSD drive.So overall a very good laptop for daily work, web browsing and watching movies, fast CPU, I really like the large sharp screen and the big keyboard layout, price is great for what you get but I would prefer a faster RAM configuration and 2 RAM slots without on board RAM.Acer could have perfected this laptop by doing some minor changes to the keyboard, putting a larger capacity battery and offering 16GB version for a bit more but I guess there are compromises you have to take when aiming for a competitive price point.Hope this helps...

  My wife is using it to do her facebook and order from Amazon. For that it works well. I'll eventually get Ancestry.com on it and then we can travel with our vices. It's working well so far.

  I just needed an inexpensive PC laptop for light gaming, email, and web browsing. This Acer Aspire fit the bill perfectly for me. It's not a powerhouse, so would not play heavy online games very well, but for the games I play (mostly hidden object and time management games) it is perfect. The display is beautiful, and it is lightning fast because of the SSD. I am very pleased with my purchase.

  I was in love with it for the first month.  Was perfect and ran well. Unit was off for 24 house plugged in. Went to turn it on, and wouldn’t boot up. Then I noticed it was extremely HOT and unplugged it. It continued to heat up. I had to keep a fan on it for 14 hours before it stopped and went cold. Have to ship back to Acer. They said they have never had this problem before. Hmmmmm.....now to wait 4-6 weeks for an answer.  I need a replacement. I have no time for the waiting game.  So not cool doing tax time for an accountant. I would find a different model. Feels like they sat in a warehouse for years. Manufacturer date is 2014. Makes you wonder

  The device was perfectly fine for everyday use, but this thing couldn't even stay on for 45 minutes of minecraft, and that's not a very graphically intensive game. I'm not sure what was wrong specifically, but the device would black-screen while playing nearly any game (Don't Starve, Minecraft) and freeze after less than an hour without fail. I did manage to play a few hours of Sims4 without issue, but I'm not sure if it was just luck or what. I did minor photo editing too using photoshop/lightroom with no issue. The laptop also got hot and loud very quickly. I'm not a total genius when it comes to computers or their parts, but this seemed a bit abnormal for me since my boyfriend's 5+ year old $150 laptop does all of the above JUST fine. I just wanted something a little newer, but now I regret shovelling out $700.

  Have it for close to 2 months.  I am very happy with it.  Everything is snappy.  The screen display is very good, i.e. sharp, bright, and no reflection.  After the 30 days return window, I added a 2nd HDD with Sony 860 Evo - 500gb 2.5"" SATA drive, and replaced the 4gb ram with a Crucial 16gb Ram. Now the laptop has 756gb memory and 20gb ram.  It has only 1 slot for ram.  The other 4gb ram is soldered into the motherboard, I guess.  Total cost of upgrade $120.  Don't get me wrong.  The laptop ran fine and fast without the upgrade.  I did the upgrade because thanks to one of reviewers who said that it can be done.  And it's always good to have more than less.  So I did it.

  Well, got my brand new laptop on the 16th. Actually received it earlier than expected, kudos to Amazon for that. Unboxing experience is pretty satisfying, the computer is very well packed and it even lifts up when you take ot out of the box it comes in. Came with the stylus, a charger and two dongles.Fist of all, buid quality is premium, you can see and feel that it is well made and sturdy, hinges work as advertised and you indeed can open the lid with just one hand.After turning it on and configuring it, all went well, did the normal updates that all laptops require out of the box, installed chrome and went on my way to start backing up my data and rearanging folders.Here comes the first issue I found. I have a Logitech MX Ergo, pretty nice trackball mouse that I have enjoyed for the last six months or so and worked flawlessly with my previous Acer laptop, I went and installed it on the Asus and things started to happen. Bluetooth conectivity is bad. The mouse disconnects after just a few seconds being still. I mean 3 to 5 seconds, this is so annoying, everytime you move the mouse it lags. It drives me crazy.I have at least three days trying to fix this and nothing. Updated the BIOS to version 303, reinstalled all drivers, power management options are very limited in this version of Windows, so nothing seems to fix it. The MyAsus app is pretty mu h useless, all disgnostics say no issues found. My best guess is that bluetooth tries somehow to save power and goes to sleep, but there is no way to override this.I did tried the mouse in two other computers and it works fine. So I am sure its this laptop. My bluetooth headphones don't work very well either if they are paired both to the computer and phone, because lf this I decided to use the dongle for the headphones and discovered that it has a hissing noise, when connected through the usb c port, both ports. This does not happen when connected trhough the same dongle to my Pixel 4, so laptop again.Lets talk battery life, 10 hours, its a lie. I can understand they tend to  overrate this times, but in my case if I get 5 hours I am lucky, and this is only using Lightroom and a Sandisk Extreme SSD drive connected through usb c. Not sure if this battery is faulty, to be honest.Laptop gets a bit hot, but nothing too serious in my opinion, its understandable being so thin and small.Overall, these are the things that have bothered me about this laptop so far.Now for the good. THE SCREEN! is amazing. Even as little as it is, quality is superb, colors are very true, is super bright and sharp. I love the 4K resolution, it allows to use very small icons so you have a lot of space when working, I love this. I am currently using it with 175% zoom, and its great. Tried going smaller but it was too small. Sound on this is very good also, surprisingly good.Another thing that I liked a lot is the trackpad and the numeric keyboard function, very usefull once you set your brain to use it. Haven't used the stylus as much, I don't care about it too much. I wanted a 2 in 1 because I travel a lot and its light and can be used as a tablet for entertainment and browsing, which is great when you are on an airport. And the power allows me to handle data and peocessing for work without having to own another bigger more powerful comouter.And last but not least, this laptop is fast, paired withmy SSD file transfer are in the order of 700MB/s which is great, coming from an HHD averaging 20 to 50 MB/s, so very useful when working with phlto and vkdeo editing.This review might be a bit longer. I will try and update about the bluetooth issues and usage all together.UPDATE:So, I was watching a video last nigjt and saw this thin greenish line at the bottom of the screen, at first I thought it was from the video itself but no, is the screen. It has a fault. I did not see it at first but when I lowered the screen brightness it was very noticeable. I thought that it appeared later on, but I did took a picture lf the laptop when new out of the box and the stripre is there. So it came like this from the factory.I will have to send it for a repair. I am very upset because of this. This is a brand new very premium laptop.

  I am a computer user for over 20 years, using both Mac and Windows, my current laptop is a Surface pro 4 I bought 4 years ago and a 10 year old Imac, that still works. I needed a more powerful machine to use Zbrush 3D, this one was reccomended to me by Intel for that purpose. I liked the looks, that it has a touchscreen with pencil, good memory,  Plenty of space etc.It arrived on Tuesday and since the moment I turned on, the screen was “washed” on one side ( see attached photo) ,And it was superhot. I knew that it may get fixed with an update, so I did the whole windows update and Bios update from Asus site, that resolved those problems.Then, it could not connect to the internet, or connects sometimes and disconects etc...annoying. I tried to play the tech support myself and got to the point that it connects but when I put it to sleep, it will not connect automatically even if “connect automatically” is on, I was willing to live with that, but then the laptop started to shut off by itself several times, I had already installed zbrush and gotten some of my personal info in it, the only solution was to “ re-install windows” , I did just that, it worked for 2 days until it got some updates today and now I got the “blue screen of death” (photo attached), it re-started 3 times and told me to use the asus diagnostic tool which I did and it came out as “warning: cannot detect HDD” !!!  Wow... (photo attached).I end this 5 day ordeal by sending the laptop back to Amazon for a refund, it is a shame because I had a 22 “ art tablet coming today that I was planning on using with this computer for my 3D Zbrush sculpting.I am not sure if Asus or Microsoft are to blame for this bad product, but I will have to buy a new Imac ( Will change my zbrush license to move it to Mac).I will stay away from Microsoft products for now (Surface is not perfect, but I learned to live to its issues, like screen freezes etc). and unfortunately will have to pay more for a Mac, but peace of mind and getting work done is priceless. Thank you for reading and best wishes for 2021.

  I almost bought a 2019 Lenovo Y540 but then I found this 728c variant of the Nitro 5. No other laptops had a 144hz display with an RTX 2060 and 16GB of RAM. I bet a turnoff for many is the smaller SSD storage. For me, I just spent ~$100 on 1TB of SSD. for a total payment of ~1.2k I feel very satisfied.I am not a hardcore gamer. I only probably play 2-3hr sessions every other day if not like twice a week. I noticed that games like Valorant bring the CPU temp to an average of 75 Celsius. I can only imagine what happens if you play a higher demanding game like Warzone.Fan noise is as I expected with a gaming laptop. when you game it is loud, but if you game with a headset you will not hear it and it is not detectable on your microphone. When you are using the laptop for everyday use, every now and then the fan will turn on but on the quietest setting to cool things but turns off after several minutes.  I am getting used to it though.As mentioned at the top, SSD storage is small in comparison to competitors' laptops. It will not be a problem if you play only some games, but if you play alot, I recommend getting an additional SSD. You can easily find SSDs between the $100-$150 range, just make sure you know or have a friend who knows how to properly install it.The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because the battery life is very short. It does not deliver the 8 hours as described; more around 4 hours at most. I always play while plugged in. Playing unplugged will probably make the battery life even shorter! The only reason I noticed the shorter battery life was because I used a Macbook before this and their batteries last around 10 hours. I dream of the day that Acer rids of the 2.5” drive bay for a bigger battery :)I am super stoked to be an owner of this Acer Nitro 5. It has its quirks for sure, but for me, they are overshadowed by the perks. If you are a relatively casual gamer I really think you will like this just as much as I am liking it.

  I purchased the Nitro 5 with the i9 and rtx 2060, fresh out of the box I tried playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive. A game that's over ten years old, within ten minutes the cpu was at 90 degrees celcius, with the fans set on maximum. I tried undervolting the laptop, by .145 MHZ, this only decreased cpu temps by 5 degrees. I couldn't play any game, even a ten year old game, without the laptop trying to melt itself. That is awful. Anybody considering buying this, don't. You'll have a fried laptop within a year.

  This review concerns the model AN515-54-728C with the 144Hz display, and may not necessarily apply to other models.The LCD panel is model ""NCP004D"" from Panda.  A reviewer at NotebookCheck tested that display panel, and found a Black to White response time of 16.8ms, and a White to Black response time of 13.2ms, for a round-trip total of 30ms.  This means that despite being 144Hz, the time it takes for the pixels to fade in and out makes it look no better than a 60FPS display.  While testing a scrolling image, 72 FPS and 144 FPS looked indistinguishable, as well as 60FPS and 120FPS looking indistinguishable as well.The AN515-44-R5FT also has the same LCD panel, and I was only able to discover this information by reading reviews of that product.There's also some backlight bleed, but it's only noticeable in a dark room with a dark screen.  The backlight bleed was not annoying enough to be a problem.Additionally, the display is only 6-bit color, not 8-bit.Aside from the disappointing LCD screen, it has great components inside.The i7-9750H CPU is very nice and fast, and mine was able to stably undervolt to -150mV.  Every CPU is different, not all CPUs will be able to reach the same undervolt and run stable.When running all cores full speed, it had a VID of 0.86V, speed of 2.28GHz, and a temperature of 71C.  When undervolted, the VID fell to 0.8V, and speed rose to 2.76GHz.When running one core at full speed, it had a VID of 1.2V, speed of 3.9GHz, and temperature of 92C.  When undervolted, the VID went to 1.15V, Speed went to 4.3GHz, and Temperature went to 87C.Multicore performance was power throttled, and Single core performance was Heat or Power throttled.  Undervolting eliminated the Heat/Power throttle on single core performance, and reduced the power throttle on multicore performance, allowing a higher clock speed.  Huge benefit from undervolting here.The SSD is a real speed demon.  Despite being only 256GB large, it read at 1077 MB/sec, and wrote at 671 MB/sec (372 MB/sec sustained).The touchpad is okay, it's less laggy than one I previously had on a Dell laptop.The keyboard has dark red key caps that are difficult to read.  With every laptop having a different layout for where to place Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys, you'd need to read the keyboard to find those keys.  Having those in dark red makes it hard to find such keys.Additionally, the Volume keys need two hands to press, as the Fn Key and the Up/Down keys are too far apart that you can't reach them with one hand.My old laptop had keys arranged as ""Insert, Delete, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End"",  while this laptop has them arranged as ""Delete, Home, Page Up, Page Down, End, Power"".  I use Home and End a lot, so I keep reaching in the wrong place to try to press those keys.  I had to disable the Power key, because I kept hitting it otherwise.  I could get used to a different keyboard layout over time, it would just take a while.Aside from those issues, the keyboard has a very good feel.  There is plenty of travel distance, making it satisfying to type, and all keys on my product worked fine.I had extremely low expectations for the speakers, but was surprised when I heard them.  Bass notes under 100hz are actually audible on this model.  Very quiet, but audible.  I bet audio quality could be improved further with proper calibration.The USB ports and Power port were very tight, and required greater than usual force to insert the power adapter, or insert a USB device, they also made somewhat crunchy noises.All in all, I say very good computer, but bad screen.

  I get the white screen of death daily saying Chrome OS cannot be found.  I've powerwashed, reinstalled the software.  Also the trackpad stops working out of the blue and rebooting the device doesn't fix it.  I suspect it is hardware issues.Also the sofware is sooo buggy.  What is the point in having a fingerprint sensor if the device shuts down every time you close the lid and requires password.  Is that because the device crashed or was that just not thought out.....Linux apps are useless because they freeze the entire device every time I use Android studio.  The only way to resolve is to hold the power button until it reboots.  I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO WEEKS and I've had this many issues.  Do not buy if you are a power user.  If your not, but a cheep chromebook.

  Very poor and buggy.os crashes every time the screen is off (sometimes even when the screen is on) and falls into recovery mode..,the screen panel just unstable and swinging like crazy, which makes it impossible to draw with the pen,battery life also terrible,Netflix app support only 480p resolutionthe 4k screen is just useless exept youtube,Linux is too limited and slow.very very bad purchase.Samsung messed up big time!Don't waste your money!!

  Wafer-thin and packed with Chromebook features, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2020 (Galaxy from now on) is a beauty. In Fiesta Red, the Galaxy catches eyes and the form build looks like a colorful piece of thick cardboard.  Currently, Amazon is selling this for $799.99 ($200 less than I purchased the unit a week ago.) I work with Windoze and Mac professionally but at home, I enjoy using several Samsung tablets, the Chromebook Pro and other quality products from the company.I was really on the fence as I have a Samsung Pro from 2 years back and it does all that I need, Yet the lure of a better screen and CPU chip finally enticed me. I also welcome the Bluetooth 5 for earbuds and the lightness of the overall unit.As others have mentioned, the battery life when using the quality screen settings are a little below four hours, weak compared to the Asus Flip, with almost better specs- but the Flip doesn't have the quality screen this unit does. (I'm not carrying a charger with me when a battery pack will do the job.)The added functionality of Android apps, which are not always available with other brands, make this Galaxy a winner. Besides, I am a Samsung fan. At $800. this is a worthy contender to Best Chromebook of 2020.

  Early impressions - Impossibly thin. Android apps are surprisingly better than web app variants. Red is the laptop color I never knew I needed. The keyboard travel and ""thud"" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.

  I got the white screen saying that ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged."" I tried installing chrome again. I restarted it. I called Samsung support and was on the phone for over two hours just for them to tell me that I'll have to send it in. I sent it the next day ($18 just to ship it), and they told me today that it was broken and they would have to send me a replacement. Fingers crossed that it goes well and they'll keep their word.The computer itself is very nice, but the software is buggy. I don't like Apple products but now I'm considering switching over. :(

  Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments.

   I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I’ve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit.

  The computer arrived for the first package, and it was in a good condition externally. There was no damage, and everything seemed pretty new. However, the trackpad and half of the keyboard did not work. Just like the water damage, the right side did not work at all. so I sent it back to the company and received the 2nd package. Trackpad and keyboard work perfectly fine, with all the ports working great. But it has so many scratches and dents. Either way, now I am using this computer, and it is not a solid state drive, it was a 500GB flash drive. I don't know why but the ""update"" does not work on this computer, so I am kind of lost and trying to figure it out. The tech support definitely knows what they are doing and really appreciate being nice to provide the package in quick time fashion and willing to contact customers.

  I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer.

  I ordered this laptop to replace mine after it was stolen. To be honest, This early 2015 model style is my favorite because it is the last time Apple left the assortment of attachments on their laptop. Having access to two USB 3 connections, HDMI, SD, and two thunderbolt connections are really handy for connectivity and losing them to get a newer model didn't seem like something I wanted to do.Having read the description and the reviews, some of which were claiming that this really was an Apple refurbished product I decided to take a chance. With my previous knowledge of the product, I was extremely disappointed in many things.1. Upon receiving the product there was no documentation included in the slightly damaged box. To ship the computer a white, unmarked cardboard box was lightly padded with bubble wrap and a thin sheet of white foam for protection. This box had been placed in a plastic shipping bag. I fell there was quite a good chance that in transit this computer could easily have been damaged.2. When I opened the box I realized there was no documentation. This lack of printed material inside only raised my speculation as to the shotty workmanship that may have gone into the renewal of the product. Without paperwork showing who did the work and whom to contact if there were issues, it seemed as if those who had done the work were not exactly pleased with their own workmanship.3. Although the laptop was clean it was not in a separate plastic bag to ensure it would not get scratched during shipment. The computer was merely placed among the packing material inside the box.4. Looking at the overall appearance of the laptop it seemed appropriate though it seemed as if the fine finishing Apple does to the outer metal shell was not correct. The edges are always crisp and smooth where there appeared to be rougher. I also noted, as visible in the image provided, that there was no tag on the bottom. Apple places a tag on the bottom of their cases with information including the model number. This number is used by several third-party companies that provide aftermarket items such as cases for their products. It also authenticates the product as being a genuine Apple product. With this missing, I feel there is an excellent chance that the bottom case had to be replaced in the refurbishing process leaving me to believe that hardware on the inside might have needed to be replaced.5. Once I turned the computer on I noticed some other details. The first is that whoever had set up the interface assumed you were using Xfinity as an internet provider. I was also extremely disappointed in this interface because of how generic it was, again not giving away any details as to who had done the renewal and giving rise to even more suspicion as to the quality of the product I had received.6; Having previously had the exact same model previously for several years I can attest that it is slightly slower than the one I had previously, the internet, as well as applications, do not respond with the same robustness as I would expect.So, this all boils down to, a consumer, I should have been more careful. I should have read the return policy more carefully noting that it did not have the normal 30-day return policy and that there would most certainly be a restocking fee if sent back. I should have thought through the fact that the renewal process may result in the cheapening of the quality generally associated with Apple products and that the parts used to restore the laptop to its original condition may not be on par with what Apple originally used.  I the future I will only buy Apple Certified Refurbished computers and not trust Amazon Renewed products to be up to snuff.

  I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition.

  I’ve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I’m happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn’t for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel.

  This experience has been great so far. My laptop arrived quickly. Set up was simple. This is my first Lenovo and so far it has exceeded my expectations and one the best laptops I have had.

  I just received this computer and it is garbage.  I couldn’t even get it set up before it encountered an error and had to restart.  After it restarted it ran for about three minutes and ran into another error and restarted.  As of now, I’ve had it on for about 15 minutes and it has run into errors and restarted four times.  I thought Apple was the worst computer I’d ever known but, now I’m missing the days when I had an Apple computer that only froze up occasionally.

  Just bought this laptop. Everything seems to be working properly except the fingerprint scanner.After many hours, I have tried everything (activated the bitlocker, made sure the BIOS security chip was active, etc.) but the Windows system still cannot ""find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Finger"".I wish the support team could provide some assistance to make this work. This was the primary feature I that made me choose this laptop over other laptops and it doesn't work.

  I had an HP Pavillion previously which was ok, but this ThinkPad has 2 times the battery life (about 6 hrs.) with steady use, more with light use. I have a blog and write a LOT!! The keyboard is much much better than any laptop I have ever owned. The keys are ""cupped"" just enough and are perfectly responsive for me. The screen is easier to see because there is no glare and the colors are vibrant. As you can tell, I love it!!

  I bought this laptop for use in my new home-based business. My old computer was slow. This one is amazingly fast, and I love that it has Windows 10 Pro. I have seen this same computer listed at Walmart for $1500, and this computer has everything I need. Setup and update was the fastest and easiest I have ever experienced on any computer.I have only had this for a few days, so I'm sure I will discover even more features as time goes by, but for now, here are my favorite things about this computer.<ul><li>It works flawlessly with a second monitor hooked up to it</li><li>It has a 10-key option built into the keyboard. If you hold down the Fn button on the left side of the keyboard, you can use the 10-key function with your right hand. I thought about attaching a second keyboard to this so I would have 10-key, but now I don't have to. </li><li>The power cord plugs into the back instead of into the side, which just works out better for me. </li><li>This computer is lightning fast. I can have 10 or more open tabs on my web browser, and it doesn't slow down a bit! </li><li>I don't know what it is about it, but the touchpad just feels nicer and seems easier to use. The surface of the touch pad and the area around it is textured. Maybe this is what makes it easier. Also, the buttons are where you can see them, rather than hidden within the touch pad. </li><li>Mine does have a backlit keyboard, but do be aware that this is a luck-of-the-draw feature. Not all of these will have that. </li><li>The battery life seems to be really long. I have not used it away from my desk much, but during the few times that I have left it unplugged for a few hours, I noticed very little drain on the battery compared to my old laptop.</li><li>The picture is very high-quality. I have a second monitor hooked up to it, which is also brand new, and other than the monitor being larger, I do not discern any difference in the picture quality.</li></ul>I will say it would have been nice if it had a touch-screen, but with all this laptop's good features and qualities, I adapted very quickly to not having a touchscreen.I am sure there are a lot of other things to love about this laptop, which I will discover over time. I will keep updating this review as I find more awesome features. I was a little nervous about getting a refurbished computer, but I am so glad I did. I never could have gotten this caliber of a computer within my budget, and it is what I needed. This is the best investment I have made into my new business so far.I use this computer for office and business-related tasks. I put it through a pretty good load with a lot of multitasking during use, in ways my old laptop could not tolerate. It seems to have the resources to handle everything I throw at it. I was thinking I would just buy a lower-cost laptop for now, then get a more expensive one once I get my business off the ground, but this one is a keeper!I do not know how this would perform for gaming, as I am not a gamer and have never tried any gaming. I just know it has everything I wanted in a laptop for business needs. If you need a computer for work or just for general everyday use, I highly recommend this one.

  So very frustrating to get the whole system set up only to find that every time I shut the lid and it went to sleep upon opening the wifi would not automatically start up. Spent 3 days researching and troubleshooting only to end up on the phone w/ Dell tech who after 3 hours of trying could not resolve the issue. They wanted to send a tech out to replace the hard drive. So happy I bought this through Amazon as the rep stuck w/ me through the call w/ Dell (who wanted to charge me to troubleshoot!!!) and agreed to refund my money promptly.

  These are the best laptops for general use and the price is insane.  I purchased many of these for work and use one at home. Hands down the best value and features for general use.

  We were highly disappointed..no activated OS and DELL said the laptop was 3 years old and out of warranty. To fix the OS would cost us more money but DELL was willing to fix the problem. The laptop was a gift for my daughter,all wrapped up with a bow. What a disappointment to see it had no OPerating System ACTIVATED and we were NOT given the activation key for the product. Microsoft also couldn’t help us so we are returning the defective equipment to PRIMETIME. Also PRIMETIME(Company who sold us the laptop)  IS A DECEITFUL name, we thought it was amazon prime so we ordered it. The name primetime is NOT An Amazon fulfilled company. However, they did say they will refund my money but it will be over 10 days.

  Battery was dead and fan wasn’t working when I received. Amazon agreed to refund but I had to ship the unit back which would cost me 200$  And they were willing to refund only 50$ for postage. Product look all fine from outside.

  The laptop is fast, the screen is mediocre, the WiFi sucks. The Intel chip powering WiFi functions crashes periodically and you either need to reboot the machine (on Windows for example) or force a PCI rescan (thankfully it's easy on Linux) to get connectivity back. Forget about a long download. I ended up getting a Tp-Link TL-WN725N to use as a WiFi adapter.

  The laptop didn’t work out for us. We had issues where the keyboard and mouse pad would randomly stop working. I think we had the laptop about a month and it happened a few times. When it happened again a few days before the return window would close, I decided we better return it. Since we got this for my daughter to do online schooling due to COVID-19, we needed a functioning laptop ASAP and didn’t really have the time to work with the seller to figure out the issue.  So, we just bought a new laptop at Costco and returned this one. I still gave 4 stars because my money was refunded promptly, no questions asked. Also, I knew buying a renewed laptop can be a gamble...you might get a lemon, but you also might get a great laptop for a great price. We took the gamble and it didn’t work out for us, but as long as we were able to get our money back and the issue was handled appropriately, which I believe it was, all is good.

  Extremely pleased that this is just what I suspected: the new Lenovo Chromebook 3 that came out this year! Mine was made in April 2020. Absolutely love the Lenovo quality. Happy to get my hands on one of these as they're all sold out at the big box stores that starts with W who is the sole provider of new ones. I feel lucky. The Celeron N4020 is better than the Celerons in basically all other Chromebooks and this screen (not a touch screen) is 30+ nits brighter than anything on this price range ($169 MSRP). This is for an elementary school student but I wish I had one as well. No squishy keyboards like the Acer I tried, solidly built, and speakers sound better than the Dell 11 and HP Chromebooks I've had the pleasure of using. I highly recommend watching some popular YouTube videos about this machine if you're considering it. I think it's gonna be the best budget Chromebook yet. The plastic is a fingerprint magnet, other than that it's great. Perfect for email, googling, schoolwork, YouTube, and light online games that a youngster can enjoy. My seller was ShopAmerica and this came looking basically new in a Lenovo factory refurbished box with a Lenovo charger. Would purchase again if I had the money, I'd love a second one. Excited to put this one through it's paces. Thank you.

  This Chromebook replaces a Windows 10 laptop which was never quite right. Chromebook is much better for my wife because security and lack of updating or virus protection is paramount. She just uses it and it is blazing fast.  Newest Chrombook software does much more intuitively than ever before. Truly plug & play!

  This is a solid chromebook, very reliable, good function, no major issues. It works just as well as a brand new unit. Recommended, 5 stars.Pros: ChromeOS up to date; fast startup, good picture, reliable operation; adequate connectivity options (USB, USB-C, Bluetooth); fast wi-fi connectivity; reasonably priced extended warranty options; connnecting an external (2nd) monitor possible, e.g. Pixel PX160 via USB-C port; solidly built without being too bulky.Cons: no HDMI port; additional USB and USB-C ports (one more of each) would be a plus. No major negatives which would amount to a full star deduction.

  I was really impressed with the packaging the refurbished Chromebook came in. The box was the Lenovo product box, but the actual chromebook came in a tight and thick bubble envelope. The actual laptop looked new, with no scratches or blemishes that I could see. It arrived fully charged and ready to be setup. It boots up quickly and easy to use. I got it so my son could use it for distance learning, and I was a little apprehensive about the 720p camera, but the quality and resolution are good enough for what it was meant for. Very satisfied with my purchase.

  Tracking number remained at sellers address until the delivery date which is when I reached out for an update. I never reached a reply but the next day I received the Chromebook which was good until I plugged it in and tried to power it on without success. As an IT professional, I troubleshooted the device with different cables and the Chromebook remained dead and unable to power on. I promptly returned the DOA device that was needed for my middle schooler for virtual school. Unfortunately I will be shopping with other Amazon vendors.

  I acquired this computer without much pretense: to have a light equipment in which I could do tests and take them anywhere without fear that it would suffer some damage and it would be a great loss. However, I was surprised that for the price paid the benefits it gives are more than enough: a good battery gives, a performance enough to handle several open tabs and some Android applications at the same time. The keyboard is decent with a good travel and size.Although the screen is TN, it allows working with acceptable levels of brightness as well as the mouse pad (although I recommend an external mouse). For $ 169 paid on Amazon, there is not a device that has these features including a good range of ports (2 USB A / 2 USB-C / MicroSD / 3.5 mm headphone port). It does not feel weak and has a pleasant texture to the touch, perhaps a coverage that does not grease so easily with the fingers would have been desirable and more storage space (32GB). It also has support included until 2026 which guarantees a great investmentESPAÑOLAdquirí este computador sin muchas pretensiones: tener un equipo ligero en el que pudiera hacer pruebas y llevarlos a cualquier lugar sin temer que fuera a sufrir algún daño y fuera una gran pérdida. Sin embargo, me sorprendió que para el precio pagado las prestaciones que da son más que suficientes: una buena batería, da un rendimiento suficiente para manejar varias pestañas abierta y algunas aplicaciones Android. El teclado es decente con un buen recorrido y tamaño y es lo suficientemente ligero para poderlo llevar a todas partes.Si bien la pantalla es TN  -lástima que no sea IPS- permite trabajar con unos niveles de brillo aceptables al igual que la almohadilla del mouse (aunque recomiendo un mouse externo). Por $169 pagados en Amazon (incluido el envío gratuito a Colombia!) no hay un equipo que tenga estas prestaciones incluyendo una buena oferta de puertos (2 USB-A / 2 USB-C / MicroSD / puerto de audífonos 3.5 mm). No se siente frágil y tiene una textura al tacto agradable, tal vez hubiera sido deseable una cobertura que no se engrase tan fácil con los dedos y mayor almacenamiento. Finalmente, promete un soporte AUE hasta 2026 lo cual garantiza una buena inversión.

  Pathetic. The laptop was sent to me with someone else's information on it. Their email address was still logged in and the system already had issues where administrator couldn't be changed and just didn't work. I don't know if it was the system or the sellers who completely screwed this but I am disgusted. I purchased a brand new laptop only to have a second hand one sent to me absolutely ridiculous.

  Processor is very powerful considering its price being relatively low, 8 gb ram is sufficient for most tasks, and the gtx 1650 is excellent for gaming with most games. The only problem with it is its low storage space of only 256 gb ssd, but that can be solved with other means.

  Just full disclosure....I did not buy from this seller. But I bought one private sale brand new for about the same price. My old basic HP laptop couldn't handle much for gaming. This blows any other laptop I've personally used out of the water. I can actually play my online Starcraft games on the highest graphics settings with zero lag or any problems. Battery life could be better but that's my only gripe. Ryzen cpu is noticably faster and smoother than Intel without a doubt. If you find one of these for under $800 it's a great deal!

  I had this shipped to the Philippines so my brother can use it. Laptop is great, fast and my brother loves it. But the thing is, he found a broken part on the laptop, so I went ahead and contact HP and Amazon about it. After going back and forth with HP, HP basically told me that in order for them to fix the laptop, it needs to be sent back to the US. I pointed out that they have global coverage and shipping back to the US would be more expensive than the fix itself. But they told me that since the model is not being sold in the Philippines, they couldn’t fix it in the Philippines. This is the biggest reason why I picked this product because of the promise of global coverage. But nope, not true. Amazon support was great and was very willing to help me out. They were even willing to pay for the shipping return label that we will have to spend. But after all the costs that would be needed to pay for shipping and customs, I still would have to pay at least $200 more than the real cost of the product so my brother decided to keep it.

  good laptop and definitely gets the job done. Even though it states 3.0 USB hubs, best transfer rate I can get to another 3.0 device is 2.0 speed. Other than that, no issues at all. If you buy, plan ahead and buy a 1-2TB SSD memory stick. Hard drive is small and fills fast.

  I use it for basic office work (multiple google tabs, spreadsheet, and lots of documents and web-based programs, basic image editing) it is fast and can multitask really well. The numeric keypad is an advantage, plus the touchscreen is cool.

  I see a lot of people mentioning the appearance of the laptop and rating it on that, which I don't think is a great way to review anything honestly.This machine does everything that it is supposed to do flawlessly. It obviously runs Chrome OS, which if you aren't sure what that means doesn't mean you should 1 star it.I''m currently about halfway through a MFA degree and this is a great machine to get my school work done. On top of that, I've taken this laptop hiking several times already and there isn't so much as an unsightly dent.Moreover, the actual aesthetic design isn't as childish looking as the thumbnail photo suggests. I am a working professional and I have zero qualms about being seen with this laptop. This is rapidly becoming my go to system, outside of my actual tower of course. And I mean, look at that price.'Nuff said

  Bought 3 of these ChromeBooks for business purposes. Now I know these were used, but they definently were not ""Renewed"". Two of them could definently pass as being renewed if not for being slightly dirty. The third one on the other hand has more than slight cosmetic damage, and it it obvious that it will no longer be as rugged as the C202SA's are supposed to be as the gap in the casing is hard to miss. Used to work for a company that rebuilt laptops and this would have been parted out and not aloud to be sold. Reviewed all the different ""Amazon Renewed"" for best ratings. But the one was anything but renewed so be wairy if you plan to buy they are just reset not renewed.

  Got two of these for my kids. The 180-degree screen hinge is perfect. The computer battery life is insanely long! they do homework on them and the batteries last several days without recharging.

  LOVE the fact that it has TWO USB 3.0 ports AND HDMI AND SD Card Slot.  In some ways it's better than my $700 laptop.  I keep movies and music on an SD card and use the USB slots for everything else.  I hooked up HDMI once and didn't explore it for very long but it looks like it is like a laptop, you can set the external screen for primary or secondary or you can clone them. Using apps from Google Play market means that you can handle PowerPoint, Word, and more even though this is not a laptop.Battery does last a looong time as others have said.Screen:  Lots of settings to optimize for your preference.  It's an 11.6"" diagonal screen with a maximum resolution of 1518x953 but if you want words to be bigger you can reduce the resolution all the way to 911x512.  Many web designers assume your screen is at least 600 pixels high and if you choose 911x512 mode you'll need to scroll (2 fingers) down to see the typical home page login screen.The other character size adjustment you have is in the browser.  So set the device for what you want your apps to look like and then set the browser for what you want web pages to look like.  On Chrome, that's CTRL  with  + or -  (or use the settings).If you're used to a tablet or phone, there is no pinch to zoom in or out.  That can be done as above, with settings on either the device or the web browser.Keyboard:  I found it to be comfortable and responsive.  Nice touch to it, and not noisy.  It's a little hard to see blue letters on black keys at night, but as there are TWO USB ports I may buy myself a little USB light to travel with.Puts out plenty of sound for personal use, or, of course, you can use headsets.Internet:  Having both 2Ghz and 5Ghz means you can connect pretty much anywhere.  I was having trouble with my older tablet and phone whenever I got hired by Google to do a day of work for them because they are moving away from the 2Ghz band, so this flexible baby solves that problem.ASUS:  Have been using their products for years.  They are reliable and responsive.Been one month.  So far I love it.  If that changes ... I'll update.  :)

  I run a business where my software is web-based and I use Google drive for a lot of personal and shared documents.  This is the perfect size to throw in my bag on the go, as well as put in some good writing time at home.  I love the sturdy keyboard and the rugged exterior.

  I wanted a  laotop that can do anything wherever I go. I mainly bought it for work to edit videos and to play some games if I wanted to.  I have the 16gb ram version and I was worried.  I had YouTube playing a high quality video with discord video chat going on And Call of Duty warzone playing at the same time. I was very impressed with its performance!  Played for 3 hours straight No problems whatsoever!  My ram was hovering around 3 to 4GB. Still plenty of Room to do other things🙏  I ended up buying the matching mouse and headset which is a MUST if you're  going to play. I'm thinking about getting the monitor  next!  If you don't go this route make sure you purchase a cooling pad. It makes a night and day difference!  This computer will run hot. You can adjust settings to cool it down a little but the cooling pad will take care of the heating.  I also but the Alienware bag/ case. It's a very snug fit which I like but in the long run you will end up scratching the tip/corner from the zipper. 🤷  Overall I highly recommend this computer to anyone!  It's super fast and the screen is amazing!  If you are worried about 16 gigs of ram. Don't.  IT WILL HANDLE IT EASY! Hope this review helped! 🤙

  The Alienware m15 R4 is an excellent choice for gaming on the go or in the event that you are unable to acquire the necessary parts for a tower pc at retail prices. This particular laptop comes with high end parts meant to last and provide superior gaming experiences. Overall a great choice for the price, considering this is for a laptop, so the convenience and portability in mind makes it a great reason to purchase if you're an avid gamer. I do recommend buying a cooling mat or external cooling pad because the laptop runs a bit hot due to its compact design. The battery life lasted me around 4-5 hours when I was watching Netflix in FHD and playing games like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and CoD: Warzone.

  Alienware m17 R4, 17.3 inch Non-Touch Gaming Laptop. This is for the version with 16GB of RAM, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6, and the Intel Core i7-10870HInitial Review April 24, 2021I think of the consumer laptop market in three categories.1) Low priced, slow, good for social networking, document creation, spreadsheets, photo editing, not for gaming.2) Middle of the spectrum reasonably fast, light, thin, long battery life, quiet. A good practical computer that may be used for some gaming, photo and video editing.3) Powerful, gaming, large, heavy, hot, noisy, expandable, short battery life. This 17"" Alienware clearly falls in the last category. This computer might also be a good choice for heavy video editingThis laptop can handle the most challenging game programs. It isn't the very top of the line but it is up there with the rest. You can order upgraded versions which have more RAM, faster processors, and faster GPUs. You decide. For me this is more than I need.This laptop is so powerful it nearly equals my fairly powerful desktop. My desktop also has an 8 core Intel core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, SSDs, and a decent Graphics Processor Unit. The advantage of this laptop is it takes up much less space than a desktop in a portable package.The first thing I did with this Alienware laptop after going through the typical Windows 10 setup was to download the 170GB of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 files. That program self adjusts to the capability of the hardware. On my desktop most of the MFS2020 parameters are set to HIGH and this laptop proved to be fast enough that the program also set the parameters to HIGH with a frame rate of  60fps. We have five laptops in the house and this is the only one that can handle graphics intensive programs like MFS2020.Pros:- A very powerful GPU with 6GB of local RAM. This isn't Nvidia's fastest GPU but it is right up there close to the top performers. It is the latest class of GPU engines in the $400 range for the GPU alone. By the way this same laptop can be ordered with higher performing GPUs with options for larger local RAM.- Running graphics intensive games will generate a lot of heat. Alienware includes quite a bit of information regarding the cooling technology in this laptop. That helps account for the weight (over 5 pounds) and I suppose the thickness of this laptop.- Cooling and Noise. While the fans seem to run most of the time the sound is smooth, not raspy. I don't find it offensive.- Intel Core i7-10870H 10th generation. Several things come together to make a fast gaming computer. One is the CPU, then there is the M2 fast SSD, the GPU, BUSS interfaces, and the bulk storage SSD. I find that the bulk of the task is given to the GPU which is where we should spend the most of our money. The CPU can certainly be a bottleneck if it is too slow but this one is fast. It's not the fastest Intel i7 but it doesn't need to be due to the GPU taking over the major tasks. It is listed as HIGH END by cpubenchmark.net.- WiFi 6. It turns out my new router is WiFi 6 capable so this is the first hardware that can actually use that faster WiFi system. If you have a fast internet service the next bottleneck would be the wireless connection to the gaming laptop. WiFi 6 is significantly faster than all previous WiFi generations.- Bluetooth included. My desktop does not have Bluetooth so I've had to use a dongle for that feature. It is nice not to burn a USB port for that function.- 16GB of RAM. My desktop has 32GB but I've found the computer really doesn't run that much faster with the extra 16GB of RAM. I'm not planning to upgrade the RAM.- Integrated front camera and microphone- A decent keyboard that is thankfully backlit.- Speakers that actually sound quite good for a laptop. While gaming I normally use earphones.- Thunderbolt/USB-C. Not only does this single port handle the USB-C interface but can handle Thunderbolt speeds. Very fast.- Thunderbolt. You can actually purchase available external GPUs which could connect to this laptop through the Thunderbolt connector.- The keyboard surface is plastic, feels good, not a fingerprint magnet. With a laptop of this large size the keyboard can be full-sized.- It's a nice looking laptop with keyboard backlit color variations and other accents on the case.Cons:- If you're looking for the top of the line fastest gaming laptop you might want to check out the other options available for this laptop including more RAM, better GPUs, and a faster CPU.- Short battery life. about 2 hours. You must bring the AC power brick along.- The 240Watt AC power brick is huge and heavy at 9"" x 4"" x 1""- Expensive. So are most gaming laptops but this one seems to be about 10% higher.- Can't upgrade RAM? Stuck at 16GB due to RAM soldered on motherboard. I have not opened the back to check this fact. I've seen conflicting comments on-line about upgrading the RAM. Some say there are two RAM slots.Things I wish this laptop had. I knew these when I ordered this computer so they are not part of my review in terms of star ratings. I just wanted others to know about some features I consider pretty standard these days that this laptop does not have.- A touch screen. This is pretty much a standard these days with laptops, tablets, phones, and even desktops. I just don't get it and it is one of the things I miss the most.- A keyboard minus the 10-key. I don't use the 10-key and it causes the main part of the keyboard to be off center of the screen.Do I recommend this laptop? Actually my suggestion is if you really want the best graphics I strongly suggest you do buy this laptop but in the other version which has a faster CPU, more RAM, and a faster GPU.

   This detachable magnetic keyboard two-in-one tablet computer is adorable in that it is so much smaller than any other laptop that I’ve owned. This Haobook106 has Micro USB port, USB3.0 port, HDMI port, DC jack, earphone jack, mic and TF card slot. It has a super thin 1280x800 IPS 10 inch high-definition touch screen display that works so effortlessly! Some of the specs are it has a 2GB RAM, 32GB of storage when support of TF card slot which can expand the storage up to 512GB! It has a very decent Camera 0.3MP+2.0MP (front and back camera). The battery is 6000mah and lasts me for days because it works so well.  The Operating system is Windows 10 which works like a charm on this device.My favorite aspect of this product is the detachable magnetic screen. It comes off so easily and quickly becomes a tablet for convenience of doing many things, but then it can fold up and be put away with added protection unlike most tablets that are exposed.I have a lot of future use in this product and look forward to experiencing it’s full potential. I would highly recommend this for a college student or for someone who likes and appreciates the multifunctional tablet to laptop capabilities. You must stay aware so that you do not pick it up by the screen because or disconnects so easily, which is a huge part of what I love about it. Just be aware.

  I ordered 2 of these tablet/laptops for my kids for Christmas. I was looking for a Windows based machine as the Google Chromebooks can't do some of the online games that they like. So, I researched and this one came up with pretty good reviews. It was a nightmare! First, just getting it set up was a pain but we got through all that and got the kids going. However, even though they weren't doing anything with major graphics or anything, the machines were SUPER slow. I have good internet and use multiple devices on it without this issue, so it isn't that. It was only slow on these machines. Additionally, it was so slow that many things wouldn't load or function at all. Really, just didn't have the capacity to do much of anything. I asked the kids and so now the laptops are on their way back in (For a $43 restocking fee per laptop btw). Cost me $86 for useless machines. Will never do again!

  We purchased this as an extra tablet to use with our label printer for our ecommerce business.  The sole use of this computer was to use the internet to generate shipping labels and then print the labels.  It stopped connecting to the internet after about 6 weeks and stopped connecting to the label printer (via USB) after about 7 weeks.  Extremely slow.  Honestly very painful to use especially considering we were only using it for one purpose.

  It stopped working and it over heats. The ROM and RAM is too low, and it frequently hangs. It’s keyboard is so small and gets jammed after 10 days or using it. I would rather go buy an acer or chrome book which costs the same price, rather than buying this China useless product

  Don’t buy it!  If you do, be very careful when opening it in “laptop” mode.  The tablet/top portion has 2 flimsy plastic tabs and one of them broke the 3rd time we used it.  Because one of the tabs broke, the top portion will not connect to the bottom/keyboard portion.  As such, it is useless.

  So I open it up and hold down the power button before plugging it in since that's when I opened the direction packet.The screen with the logo on it for the brand comes up and WONT UNFREEZE.I had bought it brand new and this is the second laptop in a week I'm going to have to return.Why Is this so difficult!?!?!?!?

2,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"" Laptop, 15.6"" HD (1366 x 768) Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 128GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics, Windows 10, 81W10094US, Business Black",$359.99,3,"
  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  I bought this laptop for my son, it works perfectly, I will upgrade the ram some time in the future, but for now, he loves it!

  Its been a while since I used a pc, had to do some updates, at first glance it appeared to not install them, but after a closer look I had to manually select Install. Everything is working as intended. I would recommend This Laptop. I like the auto on feature and the 4 digit pin login, makes it easy to get to work.

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

2,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),"Windows Tablet 10in, Ultra Slim Windows 10 Tablet PC - 4GB RAM 64GB Storage, 5MP and 2MP Cameras, 1280x800 IPS HD Display, Black",$240.59,2,"
  My previous personal computing experience was with an Android smartphone and several desktop and laptop Windows PCs. My only contact with tablet computing was indirect, as my wife has been a longtime owner (and lover!) of an Apple iPad. So my expectations for the tablet PC computing experience were forged by living with an iPad user and occasionally using her iPad together with her on joint activities.The Amazon details page for this tablet says the brand name is the highly improbable string ""SZTPSLS,"" although the back of the unit sent to me shows the brand name ""ProTek"" (see the photo that accompanies this review). This tablet is a Windows PC, so it promised to provide an environment familiar to me as a long-time Windows user.I noticed several things while inspecting the black plastic case of this tablet. First, the various controls and ports are labeled with white printing and white icons that stand out clearly and legibly against the black plastic. Bravo! I get so tired of the modern (virtually unreadable) practice of using raised, black microprint set against a black background.This product offers a USB 3.0 port, which is a great feature that seems unusual in tablet PCs. In addition, it offers the USB C port more typically seen on tablet PCs.  There is a mysterious unlabeled port between the USB 3.0 and the USB C ports. As of this writing, I have not figured out what it is. This product arrives with no documentation that can be consulted to address such mysteries. The Amazon details page is no help here.This product contains a 3.5 mm jack for wired headphones, which is a plus. (I am not a fan of Bluetooth headphones, and do not wish to be restricted to Bluetooth technology.) However, the power port and the headphone jack are both holes along the same edge of the case that appear to be exactly the same diameter. Be prepared to mix them up and possibly cause damage to your unit. This was not a good design choice.When I powered up this tablet PC the first time for initialization, I was surprised to see an ""American Megatrends"" splash screen appear briefly. I continue to see this every time I power cycle the unit. An ""American Megatrends"" splash screen generally indicates hardware trouble, but perhaps nothing critical in this case as the splash screen disappears a brief moment later.As the initialization proceeded, I was brought soon enough to the point where the tablet wanted to log on to my WiFi network. So I needed to type in the network password. The trouble was, no matter where or how I pressed the screen, I could not get an on-screen keyboard to pop up! Exasperated, I finally just hooked up a physical keyboard to the tablet (via one of the tablet's USB ports) and was able to enter the password the old-fashioned way.An on-screen keyboard did pop up at later points during initialization when keyboard input was required, but the whole process would have been stymied at step #1 (network login) if I didn't have a physical hardware keyboard handy to hook up. Also, in using this tablet for simple web browsing, I've noticed that the on-screen keyboard generally does not pop up automatically when, for example, I need to type in a password for a website. No amount of tapping or touching the screen brings it up. I'm left with summoning the on-screen keyboard manually using a button I've dedicated for that purpose on the taskbar.The normal end of an initialization process leaves you with a single login account, which has administrator privileges and is your Microsoft account (i.e., it has your Microsoft ID and your Microsoft password). When I finished this tablet's initialization, I had a single account with ID ""admin,"" administrator privileges, and NO PASSWORD! I fixed this gaping security hole forthwith.This tablet ships with Windows 10 Pro. It has a 1.1 GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of solid-state storage, all of which are below the state of the art in personal computing. Compared to my new Windows 10 laptop, this tablet seems slow and sluggish, although it is serviceable.The 2Mp camera is minimalist and unimpressive. It has a narrow field of view. In lighting conditions where my best webcams produce bright, clear, sharp pictures with good color, this camera produces a dark image with limited contrast and muddy color. The limited contrast ratio was also evident in some outdoor test shots I took, where all detail was missing on the whitest surfaces. This is a poor camera compared to the camera on my wife's iPad or the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone.The single (monaural) microphone and its associated sound processing circuitry produce a weak signal that sounds like it emanates from the bottom of a steel bucket.The two stereo speakers produce clear but tinny sound, lacking the richness and strength of the sound produced by the speakers on my wife's iPad.While my wife's iPad serves us well on family Zoom calls, I wouldn't dare inflict this Windows tablet on our Zoomed family members. The video and audio quality falls too far short.On balance, this tablet computer was a disappointment compared to the expectations imbued in me by my wife's iPad. I know that the iPad is a premium product that costs a premium price, but for $246 I was expecting more than I got from this tablet.

  This was probably one of the more difficult scores I've had to decide on.  I can understand why some people would give this lower than a 3-star rating and I almost did as well, but ultimately I decided that at least the tablet lives up to advertised features.  However, there wasn't anything at all special about this tablet to justify the price.Performance is sluggish, running on a Celeron N3350 @ 1.1GHz with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU.  Memory is also quite limited at only 3.83GB usable RAM capacity.  So although they claim this will ""smoothly run your video-editing application"", in reality you'll be lucky if it doesn't crash or hang during rendering.  Additionally, with only 64GB drive space - more than half of which can be used up by the operating system at any given time (especially if you're saving restore points) - you don't have a lot of room to work with large video files.But there is an upside to the low performance - this unit is both very slim and lightweight, and yet you can get easily more than 6 hours of operation on the battery.  So if you're doing light work (web browsing, e-mail, word processing, streaming) and need staying power more than horsepower, it may not be a big deal.On the plus side, the display is crisp, bright and viewable from nearly any angle.  The touchscreen is accurate and responsive.  There's both a USB-3.0 and USB-C port for data transfer and peripherals, as well as a mini-HDMI port and headphone jack.  Additionally, there's a microSD slot hidden behind a panel.  Both WiFi and Bluetooth performance were decent, connecting and communicating well with every device I tried.Sound quality and microphone quality is about as poor as you'd expect with a generic brand tablet this size, but is sufficient if you have absolutely nothing else available.  The cameras produced less-than-thrilling quality images, but again is sufficient if that's all you've got.  You WILL be buying and using add-on accessories if these features are important to you.One minor complaint is that the power supply jack is about the same size and shape as the headphone jack - this is a bad idea, you just know some people will try jamming the wrong jack into the wrong port.Not much came with the tablet.  The instruction manual isn't very helpful with poor English, packaging was barely adequate to protect it during shipping, and the only accessories were a power adapter, mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter, and USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter.  While the manual claims a ""one-year warranty"" and provides a card to fill out if you require service, there is no contact information provided to actually pursue a warranty repair.This tablet closely matches the Verizon Ellipsis 10 tablet both in size and placement of controls/inputs, so if you're looking for a case for the tablet you might try one designed for the Ellipsis 10.  However, this tablet is slightly larger (perhaps 1/8"" all the way around) so it might be a tight squeeze.  Due to the placement of the power switch, a lot of the generic cases that have straps at the corners aren't going to work well.Overall, this tablet is barely sufficient by today's standards, lacking in performance in every aspect except display quality, touchscreen response and battery life.  I expected much better quality, performance and/or features for the price.  Additionally, no information is given on how to pursue warranty repair or replacement or any technical support if you have a problem.  The price is pretty high considering what you get, so I honestly can't recommend this tablet for even the most basic user.  Probably a fair price would be about $150.  I'd recommend shopping around for something better or less expensive.

  I wanted a  laotop that can do anything wherever I go. I mainly bought it for work to edit videos and to play some games if I wanted to.  I have the 16gb ram version and I was worried.  I had YouTube playing a high quality video with discord video chat going on And Call of Duty warzone playing at the same time. I was very impressed with its performance!  Played for 3 hours straight No problems whatsoever!  My ram was hovering around 3 to 4GB. Still plenty of Room to do other things🙏  I ended up buying the matching mouse and headset which is a MUST if you're  going to play. I'm thinking about getting the monitor  next!  If you don't go this route make sure you purchase a cooling pad. It makes a night and day difference!  This computer will run hot. You can adjust settings to cool it down a little but the cooling pad will take care of the heating.  I also but the Alienware bag/ case. It's a very snug fit which I like but in the long run you will end up scratching the tip/corner from the zipper. 🤷  Overall I highly recommend this computer to anyone!  It's super fast and the screen is amazing!  If you are worried about 16 gigs of ram. Don't.  IT WILL HANDLE IT EASY! Hope this review helped! 🤙

  The Alienware m15 R4 is an excellent choice for gaming on the go or in the event that you are unable to acquire the necessary parts for a tower pc at retail prices. This particular laptop comes with high end parts meant to last and provide superior gaming experiences. Overall a great choice for the price, considering this is for a laptop, so the convenience and portability in mind makes it a great reason to purchase if you're an avid gamer. I do recommend buying a cooling mat or external cooling pad because the laptop runs a bit hot due to its compact design. The battery life lasted me around 4-5 hours when I was watching Netflix in FHD and playing games like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and CoD: Warzone.

  Alienware m17 R4, 17.3 inch Non-Touch Gaming Laptop. This is for the version with 16GB of RAM, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6, and the Intel Core i7-10870HInitial Review April 24, 2021I think of the consumer laptop market in three categories.1) Low priced, slow, good for social networking, document creation, spreadsheets, photo editing, not for gaming.2) Middle of the spectrum reasonably fast, light, thin, long battery life, quiet. A good practical computer that may be used for some gaming, photo and video editing.3) Powerful, gaming, large, heavy, hot, noisy, expandable, short battery life. This 17"" Alienware clearly falls in the last category. This computer might also be a good choice for heavy video editingThis laptop can handle the most challenging game programs. It isn't the very top of the line but it is up there with the rest. You can order upgraded versions which have more RAM, faster processors, and faster GPUs. You decide. For me this is more than I need.This laptop is so powerful it nearly equals my fairly powerful desktop. My desktop also has an 8 core Intel core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, SSDs, and a decent Graphics Processor Unit. The advantage of this laptop is it takes up much less space than a desktop in a portable package.The first thing I did with this Alienware laptop after going through the typical Windows 10 setup was to download the 170GB of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 files. That program self adjusts to the capability of the hardware. On my desktop most of the MFS2020 parameters are set to HIGH and this laptop proved to be fast enough that the program also set the parameters to HIGH with a frame rate of  60fps. We have five laptops in the house and this is the only one that can handle graphics intensive programs like MFS2020.Pros:- A very powerful GPU with 6GB of local RAM. This isn't Nvidia's fastest GPU but it is right up there close to the top performers. It is the latest class of GPU engines in the $400 range for the GPU alone. By the way this same laptop can be ordered with higher performing GPUs with options for larger local RAM.- Running graphics intensive games will generate a lot of heat. Alienware includes quite a bit of information regarding the cooling technology in this laptop. That helps account for the weight (over 5 pounds) and I suppose the thickness of this laptop.- Cooling and Noise. While the fans seem to run most of the time the sound is smooth, not raspy. I don't find it offensive.- Intel Core i7-10870H 10th generation. Several things come together to make a fast gaming computer. One is the CPU, then there is the M2 fast SSD, the GPU, BUSS interfaces, and the bulk storage SSD. I find that the bulk of the task is given to the GPU which is where we should spend the most of our money. The CPU can certainly be a bottleneck if it is too slow but this one is fast. It's not the fastest Intel i7 but it doesn't need to be due to the GPU taking over the major tasks. It is listed as HIGH END by cpubenchmark.net.- WiFi 6. It turns out my new router is WiFi 6 capable so this is the first hardware that can actually use that faster WiFi system. If you have a fast internet service the next bottleneck would be the wireless connection to the gaming laptop. WiFi 6 is significantly faster than all previous WiFi generations.- Bluetooth included. My desktop does not have Bluetooth so I've had to use a dongle for that feature. It is nice not to burn a USB port for that function.- 16GB of RAM. My desktop has 32GB but I've found the computer really doesn't run that much faster with the extra 16GB of RAM. I'm not planning to upgrade the RAM.- Integrated front camera and microphone- A decent keyboard that is thankfully backlit.- Speakers that actually sound quite good for a laptop. While gaming I normally use earphones.- Thunderbolt/USB-C. Not only does this single port handle the USB-C interface but can handle Thunderbolt speeds. Very fast.- Thunderbolt. You can actually purchase available external GPUs which could connect to this laptop through the Thunderbolt connector.- The keyboard surface is plastic, feels good, not a fingerprint magnet. With a laptop of this large size the keyboard can be full-sized.- It's a nice looking laptop with keyboard backlit color variations and other accents on the case.Cons:- If you're looking for the top of the line fastest gaming laptop you might want to check out the other options available for this laptop including more RAM, better GPUs, and a faster CPU.- Short battery life. about 2 hours. You must bring the AC power brick along.- The 240Watt AC power brick is huge and heavy at 9"" x 4"" x 1""- Expensive. So are most gaming laptops but this one seems to be about 10% higher.- Can't upgrade RAM? Stuck at 16GB due to RAM soldered on motherboard. I have not opened the back to check this fact. I've seen conflicting comments on-line about upgrading the RAM. Some say there are two RAM slots.Things I wish this laptop had. I knew these when I ordered this computer so they are not part of my review in terms of star ratings. I just wanted others to know about some features I consider pretty standard these days that this laptop does not have.- A touch screen. This is pretty much a standard these days with laptops, tablets, phones, and even desktops. I just don't get it and it is one of the things I miss the most.- A keyboard minus the 10-key. I don't use the 10-key and it causes the main part of the keyboard to be off center of the screen.Do I recommend this laptop? Actually my suggestion is if you really want the best graphics I strongly suggest you do buy this laptop but in the other version which has a faster CPU, more RAM, and a faster GPU.

  I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it’s still working flawlessly. I don’t regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!

  Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new"".

  I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware.

  I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend.

  Overall, this is an excellent Chromebook. Easy to use right out of the box. But there are a few frustrating design flaws. First, the left shift key was placed an entire row down because for some reason they felt it was necessary to put a random “search” button right where the shift key would go! So if you are an experienced typist, every time you go to make a capital letter, you hit the very disruptive search key and an entire search window opens. It’s beyond annoying and it really makes fluid typing difficult. I would never have purchased it for this one problem!Another design problem is how hard you have to press down on the touchpad in order to perform functions with it, it actually starts to be a big effort.Not looking for things to complain about, but these “little” things have caused me to dread using this machine just a few days in. Far from a smooth use each time!

  I had an Acer 15.6, which I liked quite a bit but I've had it several years and it was starting to rundown.  I then purchased an 11.6 (I think) and I found it to be too small.  Returned it and ordered this.  I love it.  More lightweight that 15.6, fast , screen is beautiful (HD), keyboard is fine.  No complaints at all.  Very, very happy.  Ever since I got my first Chromebook I was sold.

  I really wanted to like this. I bought this thinking Chrome OS would be similar to Windows. It runs more like a phone or tablet. The system is based on a Google/Gmail account (your password/login is your email and your password). This would be great for leisure use but I wanted a work computer. And after I turned it on, I realized I couldn’t install the Microsoft 365 suite for Windows on it. I’d have to go onto Google Play and install each program (i.e. Excel) separately and pay separately. Costing more and doesn’t have good reviews. It may just be too new for other programs like Photoshop to be available for it (I didn’t even look because it was getting to be too much work). Sadly I returned it. I really wanted to like this.If it was just for browsing the web, emails and watching Netflix, it’s a great laptop for that. It’s fast, incredibly light and the screen comes right to the edge, making it very sleek.

  I bought this mainly for my kid to be able to do school stuff - perfect as the school uses chromebooks too, or so I thought. Since I bought it near summer (May 21, 2020) it was only used a handful of times. Yesterday (August 3,2020) we needed to use it and it was dead. As in, nothing. No power button light, trying to charge it no light, wouldn't turn on. NOTHING. There is no damage to the case, screen, etc., so it's not like it was handled roughly. It just won't do anything. I would not recommend this to anyone.

  When my 2015 excellent Toshiba chromebook started to fall apart, I began shopping for a new one. After I read that Chrome only supports chromebook for five years I decided to find an inexpensive one and that led me to the Acer. Functionally, this chromebook can do everything that a chromebook promises, but the quality of the screen is woefully inadequate, and the sound is really underpowered. I find that I have to constantly adjust the tilt of the screen to be able to see the image. And as of yesterday, one of the keys is already sticking. But it will have to do. I won't pay the price to buy an expensive chromebook when the company builds in obsolescence after five years.

  This product came in timely manner, even though it was ordered holiday time. Everything works well besides for 2 issues.

It started freezing a couple of times in a day and going back to BIOS error. Now it does it at least three to four times a day and it is very frustrating to keep rebooting the laptop. Would be cautious to purchase this item

  Works well. No Ethernet port. I brought an adapter that worked well with one of my at home jobs. It didn’t support the 2nd job. However, the keys are large enough to type. So far no major issues. It’s not touchscreen and I haven’t had to contact tech support.

  Love this computer. It is the perfect size for me to use as am extra computer at work and for school work. It's light weight and I love that the key pad is quiet. I did have an issue with it not detecting any drivers after I switched the Microsoft mode but a quick call to customer service fixed that. The customer service was great, they even call the next day to ensure the fix is still working!Side note, I purchased a 9 key for it as I am more comfortable with that then the numbers at the top!

  I just finished ordering this product for the second time after returning the first product. The first LG Gram came to me and was coming up with the blue screen of death immediately. After some communication with the manufacturer and the warehouse that sent it to me, we determined there was nothing to do than to refund it. This is not something that could have been seen by the company I ordered the product from. The product itself is really nice when it worked and I made sure to order the same one hoping that it was just bad luck receiving that product. The company I ordered it from was fantastic throughout and gave me free shipping when I asked about how the shipping process worked. Everything was done in a timely manner and ordered my second computer knowing that I can trust them incase this issue happened again.

  I have only had this computer since it was delivered an hour ago. I really like that it is very light and it has a very appealing keyboard. The set up was very easy using the assistant. I was also able to find an app in the Microsoft store that allowed me to leave the edge and Windows S as I already have a Microsoft account. I was able to download chrome very easily. I am not going to be using it for fancy gaming and I will keep my hard drive available to hold my files but I will be using it for writing and other tasks.

  I was skeptical about the specs of the laptop when I bought it but I am more than pleasantly surprised on performance.  Yes it can really use another four gigs of RAM ($20) and will run in dual channel mode, or you can load it up with an eight or 16 gig stick with slightly less performance but more simultaneous applications.  I'm actually more than pleasantly surprised that $150 laptop with a full version of Windows home a free upgrade out of s mode can run everything I throw at it as a semi-power user.  This Intel gold actually has better specs than the entry level i3.  Once you get into the quad 6 and 8 cores yes they do blow this out of the water if you are using power hungry spps.  The LCD is washed out and matte but after adjusting the gamma and contrast it's a little bit better but not great that's probably the biggest knock I have on it.  But it does have an HDMI slot and pushes a pretty good picture and external LCD with a higher quality resolution color spectrum.  The internal m2 disc IO came back on the low side but nowhere near SATA saturation so the disk included is definitely not a bottleneck.  You can add a 2.5 in drive but you'll have to find and buy the right drive caddy and cable from a third party China sealer because lenovo is backward forever.  Yes it's fully plastic chassis and body, one heat pipe, the smaller cavity battery to allow for the 2.5 drive. With a very slight modification and some two-sided tape you can easily fit the jumbo replacement battery in this thing. I can't believe I scored this thing for $154 new from the Mart of walls black Friday sale.

  I had a lot of hope switching from HP to Microsoft.  I thought that getting the top of the line laptop would be faster and have longer battery life.First off the packaging feels a bit flimsy and less durable.  It's definitely lighter from the HP 360 spectre I had, but it comes at a cost.My HP spectre was 10 years old intel i7, 512 gb SSD and 8 gb of ram and was running great, but after 10 years I thought I could use an upgrade.  After setting it up I noticed that it seemed a tick slower even with 24 gb of ram.  So I tested it and found out that the HP fired up faster to the home screen by 20 secs faster!I thought I can live with that if the battery lasted longer.  Guess what?  It doesn't.  I tested it from 100% that I get about 3.75 hours of battery before I have to plug it in.  That seems crazy off of what is stated!  After 10 years my HP matches the battery life.With that said, if you're going to buy a surface for speed and battery life try the AMD processor.  I would still feel a bit skeptical to be honest.I'm truly disappointed.

  The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15"" model is certainly an excellent laptop and an extremely credible alternative to other premium Windows-based laptops, AND MacBook Pros. My current workhorse is the 2019 16"" MacBook Pro, so let's compare the two here, despite there certainly being a price difference.1.) The aluminum chassis is stunning. It's incredibly minimalist. If you think Apple is minimalist with its MacBook line, Microsoft takes it to the next level. A solid mass of black (in this reviewer’s case), and ice cold to the touch.2.) Really lightweight at 3.4lbs, compared to 4.3lbs on the MacBook Pro 16. 2496 x 1664 (201ppi), - though not as good as on the MacBook Pro 16, (3072x1920, 226ppi), - still looks the part. Colors are not as vibrant as the MacBook Pro, only covering 75% DCI-P3 compared to 99% on the MacBook Pro, and the difference is really, really obvious. The display is certainly good, but in 2021 this isn't close to flagship. Throw in a pretty mediocre max screen brightness (380 cd/m2), this isn't great. The MacBook Pro 16"" will hit about 500cd/m2, and the difference side my side is staggering. It is a touch-screen, mind, but I’m still not convinced a touchscreen on a non-convertible laptop has tangible benefit to most users.The auto-brightness setup is very “jagged,” not a smooth fading up or down in brightness, - and I just turned this feature off as I found it very distracting.3.) The trackpad is responsive, though it’s pretty small compared to the MacBook. While I prefer the nice, physical trackpad click on the Surface, the MacBook’s trackpad allows you to “click” anywhere.4.) Port selection is really, really poor here. A single USB Type-A, a single USB Type-C, a headphone jack, and the Surface proprietary charging connector (something that really seems incredibly pointless, especially in 2021). No Thunderbolt ports of any sort here, which is a major oversight. Thankfully you can charge via the USB Type-C port so you don’t have to use the Surface proprietary port if you don’t want to.As an aside, setup of the Surface Laptop 4 is easy. Turn on, run through some initial setup, and you’re done pretty quickly. Bloatware is kept to a complete minimum, and I only found myself removing Microsoft 365 and a few other extraneous apps.5.) The keyboard is good. It’s not the best, a little spongier than the MacBook Pro 16’s, with a slower rebound, but still among the “good” keyboards on the market, - reasonably tactile. It has physical F-keys, something I wish I had on the MacBook Pro 16. I think the TouchBar is one of the worst things to happen to MacBooks (inadvertent touches are the worst!), so I hope Apple reverts to physical keys this coming year on their flagship system. Rumor has it they will.6.) Ergonomics are decent, though it’s actually a bit tricky to open the laptop as there’s no indent where you’re meant to flip the screen up, - a peculiar oversight. Bezels are a little large for 2021, but far from offensive.7.) Sound quality is not bad, but a far cry from the bass that the MacBook Pro 16 is able to generate. You could certainly listen to music here, but headphones would be preferred.8.) Battery life and thermals are absolutely fantastic, decimating the MacBook Pro for general usage, which is just a portable toaster. The laptop just runs remarkably cool with this AMD setup. That said, when the fans kick in, they kick in with a WHOOSH, which can be a bit disconcerting. Battery life is superb, easily giving me 8-11 hours for general web usage, a good 40% longer than my MacBook Pro doing the exact same things at a comparable brightness.  9.) The SSD is nothing too special. While yes, any SSD is faster than not-an-SSD, this is on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of NVMe performance.Overall, I really enjoy the Surface Laptop 4, but it’s not hard to see where Microsoft could make some massive improvements and solidify the Surface line as THE Windows 10 systems to buy.4 out of 5. A worthy alternative to high-end laptops, but not yet at the top of its game.

  Nothing much to complain about really. It's good. Just felt suspicuous about it. Like it felt like someone was trying to track where the computer went or something. The blue tooth was left on and the laptop turns on as soon as you lift the top up. I found that wierd. Very weird.

   The days of paying $400 to $500 for even a entry level laptop is definitely gone. With these brands that are coming out, not only you can afford an entry level laptop for less than $300, they perform as good as some of the $500 laptops out there.This is one of the reasons why I bought a second laptop as our children are homeschooled and the technology seems to accelerate faster and the devices get outdated quickly. This laptop is very fast for its price range and it can do just more than light gaming as well as daily surfing and work-related tasks. The screen is nice and bright and can play HD videos and was able to play Roblox which seems to be very popular with kids nowadays without it lagging.The Wi-Fi also has the standard 5 gigahertz and 2.4 GHz antenna as well as Bluetooth connection so most modern devices will connect to this laptop perfectly fine. The surface area for the the touchpad is also large outside of using a mouse but it's nice and lightweight, it's thin, and for the price you can't beat it 😃👍

  I don't like the registration process.  I have tried for 5 days to register this computer and have not been able to.  I have received no help in getting it done even though I've chatted twice (one chat person just hung up on me), talked to people on the phone, visited the web site they told me to but only saw replies to questions.  I could not talk to Tom at all.  Can't use Dragon to dictate or play games.  Deeply disappointed.  Very, very unfriendly user site for registering product.  Don't know how to get passed the invoice receipt request.  Can't cut and paste, don't know where to e-mail copy to or mail it to and don't know how to transfer picture of it from cell phone.

   Nice laptop, but it clicks when it starts, (see the movie), like its trying to access the hard drive. Then it gets the error message (in the photo), that says the hard drive is protected by a password system. ??? Why? Something when it was upgraded? Any ideas on how to turn this off? If its seeking the hard drive for no reason, that cant be good long term. All these extra gyrations are also causing a really slow boot up. Its not for corporate use, its for home use, no need for hard drive protection, feels like a mistake that its on. I will turn it off, I just need to know how. Thanks. PConline365?

  I'm not sure about this computer yet. I have been a business systems consultant for 20 years so I'm pretty adept at using laptops.  When I got this one and turned it on, it didn't walk me thru any of the normal start/up set up like I'm used to.  Almost like it was already used. It works great for a few days, really fast and no hiccups, then all of a sudden it shuts off in the middle of working on something, several times in a day.  Also, the other day (after using it a month now), I turn it on and NOW it walks me thru all the start up settings I expected it to a month ago when I turned it on for the first time.  So it's very herky jerky.  I expected to love it for the money, and I really don't.  I am considering returning it for a refund but don't want to start all over with another new computer at this point.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

Battery life @midrange use setting is 9+ hrs. Currently at 60% which translates to 6hrs. Great for work /school on the go. Screen can be hard to see when watching movie/gaming depending on back lighting in room and screen angle view. Side speekers are clear /loud. Mouse pad takes some getting used to but not bad.

  While the descrition does not say either way the pictures show the backlight button on the space bar and when looking at this laptop pretty much anywhere it seems this is a pretty standard option.  The particular model I received is not equiped with it.  If this is a feature you are looking forward to as I was perhaps look for this same computer under a different model number.  Outside of this it is a perfect computer for what I need and touchpad is great, keyboard is great, nice to have the separate buttons for mouse clicks in some situiations is helpfull.  I have always been a Lenovo fan because they are built very well and durable. Overall the computer is great but I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard.  Not a huge dealbreaker but would have been great to have.  If this is important to you I highly recomend this computer just maybe shop around for it under a differnt model number.

  I haven't owned a windows computer for the longest time because in the past they have been very slow and experienced a lot of issues. After getting the Lenovo ThinkPad, it has changed my mind on windows computers and I have really enjoyed using it. I have been more productive with this computer because of how fast it runs even with many programs at the same time. The screen size is great and has a great picture quality. I like that it doesn't come with much too much unnecessary bloatware that many windows computers come with. The keyboard feels very comfortable and responsive. The number keypad on the side is very convenient as well. Overall I really like the laptop have had a great experience with it so far.

  I placed my order for my  lenovo laptop yesterday and it arrived this afternoon. I have been working on this computer since then for about 5 hours to browse the webpages and to do work with MS Office applications, and to read from Kindle, etc. I cannot highly recommend it for the very fast speed to start and work with any programs. Much much faster than my Macbook Air! Besides, the windows system is a bit more open than Apple OS. I really don't like the hegemony Apple OS holds over my music, photos, and office files. I could not even update my office on Apple OS. It is really a good computer that deserves enthusiastic recommendation and popularity.

  I was really looking forward to see what optane memory is all about , and if I don't like it , I was going to remove it and install second SSD as storage . Nope . It does not have optane Memory in it , it does not have second PCI-e where you could install optane , Intel RST shows that laptop is not optane ready and Bios has no optane settings . Oh BIOS , that's another thing . I haven't seen bios this bad since 1986 . Barely ANY settings in there . Moving on . Description shows AC wifi but instead it has wifi 6 . Very Happy about it since I have wi-fi 6 AX router and range is great . Screen is good but it's flickering ( Barely noticable ) because bad graphics driver . I know that because when I boot laptop with bootable ubuntu screen does not flicker . I love the gray keyboard , it looks Gorgeous and lights up really nice . Sound is pretty decent but I use bluetooth headset for most of my video watching . I upgraded memory to 16GB and swapped SSD with 500GB WD Black . Everything runs snappy , but I am missing lots of settings that were available on my other  Laptop and my work pc . ( Probably due to bios ) . For example . Power options has no settings for cooling policy , selective usb suspend , Graphic settings , it does not give you power button option to just turn off the screen etc . Maybe when some updates come out it will be corrected . Screen is glossy ..... I don't know who is the genius who makes touch screen and makes it glossy . HELOOOO Think people THINK !!! LOL . Anyway I ordered MR. Shield anti glare screen protector , 15 inch Macbook and Installed it and it's much better I had to do some cutting but it came out perfect . It did not degrade screen in any way and I don't see my self in the screen when I'm looking at something Dark , and Fingerprints are Rare .

  First, the ""Pros""Excellent screen, with good color balance, brightness, and contrast. No light ""bleed"" on dark screen. And - 1080P display - great for videos. Good touch response.With 4 core i5 hyper-threading, 8gb ram, the computer has quite snappy performance - can multi-task, multiple web pages, and can run many games - although probably advisable to use a laptop cooler.....Keyboard feel and travel is good - back light a great addition - has 2 level brightness. Track pad works perfectly.Sound from speakers is pretty good for this size laptop - sound through headphone port is excellent.Updating went well - no issues.  This thing boots in only a few seconds - did I mention this is pretty quick?Full size USB ports, USB C port, HDMI port, SD port, and headphone port.The SSD is 256GB, but can use an SD card to expand storage.Cons:When a card is installed in the SD port, it sticks out a little - should have been designed to be flush.Although lighted keys are great, if the keys were dark with the light lettering, would have been even easier to see.Finally, there seems to be conflicting info as to whether there is (or is not) Optane memory installed - however there is an app for Optane management installed on this computer.Overall, quite a good computer in this price range, and I find it surprisingly capable.

I ended up returning it because my last laptop was super lightweight, and although this computer isn’t heavy by any means, I just wanted a laptop closer to the weight of my previous model. Also it gets a little hot on the bottom shortly after being turned on, which is a pain point for me.I do have an issue with the seller taking out about $100 when I returned it (as a restocking fee). I know that’s their policy, but that’s like 20% of the entire purchase. It’s honestly ridiculous. I even set the settings back to brand new before sending it back to them, and put MORE padding in the package than it had arrived with, just to make sure it got back to them in perfect condition. So just reallllllly be sure before you buy this and especially before you open the box. $100 down the drain when I literally sent it back within the 30 days and in perfect condition. Just be really sure. That’s all. And yes I contacted the seller directly about this, but they failed to see/care about my point of view.Rating is strictly for the laptop. I didn’t really use it, but it’s a beautiful and powerful machine. Backlit keyboard has like 3 levels.

  I was hoping that this ASUS laptop would be a pleasant upgrade to a 6 year old ASUS ROG laptop. Unfortunately, right out of the box this laptop immediately started overheating on startup. When I opened up an internet browser, or tried using the file explorer, this laptop froze several times. Seems like plain bad luck, but this is really disappointing since I've had an ASUS for several years, and it never had problems like this.

  This is a decent laptop except for running a bit hot. That is to be expected considering the amount of raw processing power packed into it. However, my RMA experience with ASUS has been an absolute nightmare. I sent the computer into RMA due to some minor screen problems, was given a quoted repair time of 2 weeks with the possibilities of minor delays due to the current situation. The computer was delivered to them on August 30th. It is now 2 months later and they still haven't fixed it.  They claimed they had to transfer it to another repair center, which they spent 6 weeks doing. Now that the computer has arrived at the new repair center, there haven't been any updates for 2 weeks despite multiple calls. It is for this reason, and no fault to the product itself, that I can NOT recommend this, nor any other ASUS product, to you. Since the consumer service experience is simply deplorable.

  You cannot beat the price to performance on this laptop. The processor alone makes it standout at this price range, but WOW Asus really put together a great machine.This laptop has been nothing short of amazing for me. The reviews about fan noise are extremely overstated. If you are running a AAA game on it of course the fans are going to spin up and make a little noise.Also, the review that says the keyboard and track pad locked up on them I highly suspect they accidentally disabled them in armory crate.I’m not going to waste time restating what others have said and keep this simple.The build quality is superb. The laptop feels sturdy and the screen has minimal flex when opening with one finger from the center or either corner.The I/o is sufficient and exactly what you would want from a gaming laptop. 3 USB ports, a USB-C port, HDMI out, a full Ethernet Jack (not one that pops out), and a combined headphone/mic jack.As far as the specs go, I’ve included a screenshot of a benchmark list for common laptop CPU’s as of today 2/25/21. The Ryzen 7 4800HS is a monster. The 1660ti max-q is the equivalent of having a 1070 and both of those GPUs are more than enough to run today’s AAA games at 1080p with reasonable graphics settings. Not to mention the screen with 144hz refresh looks PHENOMENAL.One final small thing worth mentioning is the bloatware included with this system is minimal and that’s great in my opinion. Just uninstall mcafee and you are good to go if that type stuff bothers you.Overall, if you are looking for a laptop in the 1k-1100 range stop looking and buy this one. It’s worth your money.

  Scored this beauty from the mason warehouse page . And let me tell you , was it worth the “risk factor” to buy it used and save several hundred dollars on it ....DUH.The laptop came through with all included apparently work and accessories ( power cord and brick ) and ALL important stickers were left of the keyboard deck as well as the under monitor bezel.Seriously couldn’t tell you if the device was ever actually used . I absolutely love it. The size is perfect for my backpack. The fit and finish from ROG is amazing .In the end I’d say this is less a review of how exceptional the laptop is and more about the Amazon warehouse .  I mean it’s only ever going to be a product of its components so as long as you’ve researched what you want from a system and order with confidence go with the risk and save those dollars for all the peripherals out there to add to your new laptop

  I had to replace my laptop and spent a lot of time researching a new one. I had ordered one from another non-Amazon source and, despite the seller's assurances, it wasn't going to work for my needs. I returned it and began searching again.  A friend recommended this machine (this is my first non-Dell laptop purchase). So far, I absolutely love it! It has the perfect memory and power to run the games I play, it handles my graphic design and word processing needs as well. It is fairly quiet. The battery life is good (so farr). The monitor is excellent. I didn't realize it didn't have a camera, but I simply bought a small webcam to use as needed (I teach music lessons via Skype). The audio is really good, too. Clear sound.

  This may or may not be a good laptop. IT advertises """"NanoEdge display with Touch option"" and ""new screen Pad 2.0 upgrades the traditional laptop ....adding an interactive SECONDARY touchscreen"". Well.

   I came across this computer while looking to replace my previous laptop, a predecessor of this one, the Zenbook 3 (UX390). I had it for about 2 years and the only issue I had out of it was some strange fan noise occasionally.I liked the innovative use of the trackpad as a secondary screen, the dedicated MX250 graphics, as well as a 10th gen i7 CPU. So I decided to pull the trigger on a brand that has worked well for me in the past.*The Good*The computer itself is built very well. Zero screen flex, nice rigid keyboard deck, silky smooth trackpad, and the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. The screen pad is neat, but kind of a novelty mostly.Overall performance is snappy, and light gaming can be done without it breaking a sweat. The small form factor and solid build quality make it easy to want to take it along wherever you're going.*The Bad*After two weeks of ownership, however, I have decided to return this computer for screen related issues.Within a few days of having it, I began to notice faint lines in the screen that were lighter than the rest of it. This was most apparent when displaying a solid color on a large portion of the screen. These lines would come and go, and weren't super obvious unless a solid color was displayed. I also noticed some flickering at times as well.Then, while watching Netflix the other day, the entire screen suddenly became washed out and flickery. Two restarts and a full factory reset have confirmed that it's a hardware fault and not a driver or software issue.I had high hopes for this computer, and I'm sure this is an isolated flaw in my particular unit, but a major hardware failure two weeks into ownership has me wanting to go with something else instead.

  The laptop has a very nice textured metal look to it. The Screenpad is an innovative design combining the best parts of a touch-pad, a macro-key add-on, and a small second screen. My only issue here is that, because you have to switch between these functions, it causes pauses in work-flow as you switch between them. This is particularly true when switching on the track-pad function to move around the screen and then back to whatever other function you were using on the Screenpad. However, the software design for these functions is excellent. There's even a quick, temporary switch to make it easier. It's only the fact that it needs doing at all that slows things down. Once you learn the ways to move things between screen and pad, it's very easy to do. I actually wish there were more Screenpad apps. (There are just a few.) But the ones there are work quickly and well.The main screen is bright and readable and the extremely small bezel makes it look even nicer. It's only 1920x1080 but for a 13-inch laptop, that's not bad. It isn't a touch screen. I caught myself reaching up to the screen to touch it a few times. Having a touch screen might have solved the issue I had with switching functions on the Screenpad.The combination of a powerful processor, a decent graphics card, and a solid-state storage drive makes this device agile and responsive. The graphics card has only 2GB RAM, which isn't enough to support use in Premier Pro or After Effects GPU-based rendering without a trick but it's enough to handle most every other task. The 16GB internal memory was great for all kinds of tasks.The port allotment for the device is excellent. 1 USB-c 3.1 v2 port, 1 USB-a 3.1 v2 port, and 1 USB-a 3.1 v1 port make it possible to connect all kinds of add-ons without a separate hub. The built-in HDMI port is very nice to have too. Finally, a full stereo out and microphone in audio jack is great to have. It also supports WiFi (though not version 6) and BlueTooth for non-wired connection.I do wish that it had a USB-c power connection since all of my existing power bricks are that type. The former standard barrel power connector is OK, but the power brick is of a substantial size. It would be nice to replace it with one of the newer, smaller GAn models.All-in-all its a great device even given the caveats above. I notice that it has a sibling model where the Screenpad is located above the keyboard and the touchpad is a separate device. I like that design better even with the $400 difference in price. Consider whether you intend to use it with a mouse all the time or whether you'd find switching between trackpad and other functions a bottle-neck. If that's not a problem, this is a good, workable device.

  When I first received the laptop, I was so happy. I love the touch screen effect but, what takes my joy away is that the laptop shuts off and restarts by itself all the time. It’s been like 4 times today that it has done that, and it’s entirely frustrating.That needs some serious improving ASAP.*****UPDATE ******After this review,  I was connected to the tech support who was so patient & worked me through the settings...My laptop was initially on the sleep mode, so it shuts down periodically!

  I had a business class HP laptop for the past 3 years, and while it was dependable and easy to use, it seemed that every time it got a Windows update, something else stopped working properly.Deciding to go with a Chromebook was one of the best decisions I've made! It is compact, easy to use, lightweight, and I LOVE the touchscreen feature. The battery lasts a very long time. It boots up quickly and multi-tasks well! Can't say enough good things about this laptop/tablet!

  This HP 14 Chromebook was pretty decent outside of some power issues that left me dumfounded.  The touchscreen was responsive but the viewing angles were atrocious. For $10 more you can get a 15.6” Acer with touchscreen IPS and a higher resolution.PROS: Good battery life / Responsive touchscreenCONS: Sometimes wouldn’t power on / Terrible viewing angles / Priced too high for the low resolution screen.The Acer Chromebook with AMD processor and 1080 IPS touchscreen is hands down better in every way to this HP Chromebook and only $10 more at the Local “Red Bullseye” store.

  Horrible. I just received this laptop today and I am already returning it. First the laptop would not turn on even after I left if on the charger. When it finally came on at 99 % battery life I was on it for about 10 minutes and the screen froze and blacked out. I could not get it to turn back on. Very disappointed now I have to wait nearly two weeks or more to get my money back and this was bought for school.

  In the picture,  my old ASUS laptop is on the left, bought new for $600 in 2019. The new 2020 Lenovo on the right, for $499. I needed to replace my ASUS due to a manufacturing defect, and decided I needed something a little larger.Comparing the Lenovo to the ASUS-- Lenovo is much faster even though it has around the same specs as the ASUS. Loading webpages, opening programs, etc. is almost instant on the Lenovo.- My biggest issue with my ASUS is that it would easily overheat if my screen was too bright or I overwhelmed the CPU fan and it made this awful grinding noise, I have yet to experience any overheating issues with the Lenovo even with running webpages, videos, games, and over programs at once.- The keyboard buttons do look cheaper since they aren't backlit like on the ASUS, but I find the keyboard overall to be much easier to see and use on the Lenovo, the number pad on the right is a great addition as I use my laptop for work as well as gaming.- The screen on the ASUS does seem to be better quality picture as it's more of a touchscreen glass, and the Lenovo screen is more of a traditional laptop screen. However, both touchscreen work just was well, and I feel like I found see as many finger marks as I do on the glass screen.- The sound quality and loudness is much better on the Lenovo, like, super loud.- Even though these two laptops are vastly different sizes, they weigh about the same. I find the larger screen on the Lenovo also easier to see, as the ASUS is only 13"".All in all, I am pleasantly surprised with how well the laptop works. Along with the expedient shipping and care put into packaging. Good warranty terms as well. Over one month in and everything is still working as good as the first day, let's hope it keeps working that way!

  I have this same model purchased by my employer for work use, but wanted to buy my own for personal use. I shopped for laptops for a few years but really wanted this one because it's lightweight (3 lbs), the perfect screen size for me (14""), has an anti-glare screen (hard to find these days), has mouse buttons, and the specs match my needs. I first tried buying a brand new one directly from Dell ($1227) because I was afraid to buy refurbished. Ironically, the new one was defective and I decided to return rather than replace it. I then tried to buy a new Latitude 7490 directly from Dell, hoping to have better luck. Nope! Defective as well. So I decided to give this refurbished one a try. It works perfectly! Can't believe how much money I saved and I ended up getting exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend.

  This laptop works like a boss!  I'm using it for school and the unit originally showed up with a corrupted install, the wrong power adapter, and a battery that only lasted 1 - 1.5 hours max.  I'm leaving full marks here because contacting EPC customer service has been more than pleasurable and they took care of every single issue I've had.Now the laptop does what I need it to, is light, powerful, fast, and will last as long as I need it to to get my work done.I could not be more happy with this laptop.

  Hola, su apoyo por favor.Reclame en el compra de la laptop que el cargardor NO funcionaba y no era el cargador que le correspondia, entonces me ayudarom a buscar el cargador, después dijeron que tenia que pagarlo y ustedes me daban un cupón por la cantidad que valida el cargador más pago de en envío a México, ya que con justa razón la computadora no funcionaba si no tenia cargador, hasta el día de hoy ya pasaron varios meses y no me aparece mi cupón de descuento ligado a mi usuario y si ya les compre el compre el cargador porque requeria usar la comptudora.Por favor me apoya con su contestación, dicha reclamacióm la hice cuando me llegó la laptop, un día después.De antemano gracias.Saludos cordiales

  This is a great laptop.  I have it dual booting Windows and Linux Mint.  This is out of the box linux compatible.  The battery life is pretty good.  The display is great.  Mine came with 16GB  of ram in one stick.  It has two ram slots.  The specs online show the ram is upgradable to 32GB if you really want that much. The drive is an NVMe.  For those that like to take things apart, the ram and the NVMe are right there once you take off the bottom cover making it easy to upgrade both the ram and the NVMe.  I have not had any heat issues, runs quiet.  I really like it.

  The computer itself is exactly what you pay for. No issue there. But by god. Trying to get your one year subscription to Office 365 that is included is a joke. You have to go through HP which first will try to tell you that it only is a 30 day free trial even though in the description it clearly states one year of office 365 is included. I have been chatting with them for almost two hours now, and have had to send them multiple photos of what the box says. Honestly, I should’ve  just bought the 365 subscription for $99.99. I could’ve taken the two hours I’m invested into this customer support session and put it towards other aspects of my life and came out ahead...

  Item weight of 3.9lbs in the ""technical description"" is **highly inaccurate**. Im so happy I bought this laptop despite this 3.9lbs inaccuracy, as this laptop is extremely lightweight and portable - probably under 2lbs. As another reviewer said $1300+ laptops are often crapshoots --- my mid2012 Macbook Pro gave me constant headaches since 6months after purchase-- problems that even Applecare Warranty couldn't fix and Applecare refused to replace it so essentially i wasted $1500 on my easily overheated Macbook Pro and never wanted to waste $1500 on a basic laptop again (next expensive laptop will be Razer Blade or Gigabyte AERO). This time around, I needed a basic laptop for trading software programs that take up a lot of memory, so I bought 2 of these and will probably buy 1 more as I need to run 6 programs total so Ill split 2 programs on each. My experience: nicely packaged, arrived with a full battery, setup in under 5 minutes, it recognized all nearby wifi options (and a lot of cheap laptops don't recognize wifi signals) , i downloaded the software that I needed in a few minutes. Everything set up fast and seamlessly. Trackpad super easy to use. It sometimes briefly/momentarily lags when I type but i also type 90wpm .... I bought the $50 two year Asurion insurance just in case it turns out to be a lemon in 6month+ . For $270 , with insurance, i can buy 3 and be happy using these for specific, niche purposes or as reliable backups. Ive tried other cheap laptops and this has the User Experience of an expensive Apple laptop (im much happier with 3 of these than 1 2019 Macbook Air like my sister just bought). Only real CON is it could be brighter (it definitely has lower brightness than both Macbook Pro and Macbook Air). I will be running the software this upcoming week Monday-Friday for 8hours/day-- so unless when I actually run the software it freezes, crashes, or overheats excessively -- I'll remain a happy camper. Will keep the actual functionality updated in the comments.  But so far, thanks JUMPER!!! Please, fix your 3.9lbs description (which might scare buyers off like it almost scared me off) because for the price, size, *specs* (6gb ram), and weight this laptop rocks!

  Was not expecting much from this when purchased, but I gotta say it works REALLY well. Without all the bells and whistles of useless programs and features most people will never use, this is PERFECT for a student or even your elderly parents. Simple and easy to use and lighter and more compact than an Apple of the same size.I did install Firefox because I really don't like Microsoft; AND I DID NOT WANT TO PAY $600 plus FOR AN APPLE...and it runs way better than the installed Microsoft Edge version of Explorer. Able to have 10 tabs open, doing various things and performance was not compromised. Whether keeping up with your social media to Streaming video full HD video, this laptop SHINES!!! The display is simply beautiful.While it doesn't have a ton of hard drive space, that's what external drives are for. I have been storing ALL of my files on one since I had a massive HD fail on me about 15 years ago.  And if you need word processing there are many great FREE programs you can use. And the battery life is BETTER than my daughter's Apple!!!YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PERFORMANCE & EASE OF USE FOR THE MONEY!!! So stop thinking and click that ""BUY NOW"" button!

  This is a really good computer for the price. Don't let the chinese/japanese characters scare you. It boots up pretty fast, maybe 10 seconds at most. It's made out of aluminum and feels sturdy while staying light. The bottom heats up but wouldn't burn your legs, maybe sweat. There's some bloatware but it's easy to uninstall. One of the things I don't like is the coloring, the WHOLE computer is the same material and color except for the trackpad (which is also nice). The fact that its 6gb of ram and 64gb of memory should make you buy it considering the price. It lags sometimes, but its bearable, you won't have programs crashing though. I'm using this mostly for watching youtube and school, so it works for that. I haven't played any games with it but I wouldn't recommend it because there's only 64 gb and the processor isn't the strongest. 4.5/5

  The EZ book has a great screen - sharp, with rich colors, and 1080x1920 resolution. The cpu has 2 cores, and it can run at 2GHz+ even though it is rated ar 1.1GHz.6GB of memory helps tbe laptop to run smoothly and responsively.The laptop feels more upmarket than the price indicates. The screen is in Aluminum housing, and the keyboard feels solid. I added 128GB sd card to increase the standard 64GB disk space.Overall, i am happy with the purchase. The laptop can do basic web browsing, word editting, soreadsheet, etc.

  I don't normally write reviews, but I'm so happy with this laptop that I thought it deserved a review.  It arrived yesterday and so far it has exceeded my expectations.  This a good looking, light weight laptop.  Set up was a breeze due to the on-screen assistant.(loved her voice).  I am amazed by how quickly it boots up.  When I turn  it on  I'm at the login screen in seconds.  A touch of my finger on the fingerprint reader and I'm immediately at my desktop.  The picture quality of the full HD screen is beautiful.

  for my purposes like excel, word, browsing, social media, blogging, light photo-editing, and other non-intensive (non-gaming) activities, this laptop is great. it's fast, 0 to 60 in 10 seconds (the fingerprint reader helps rather than using the password). it's quiet; it's replacing an old dell inspiron 15 which had become a constant whir of fan and hard drive so that the acer feels almost eerily quiet. i did due diligence and the big bang of cpu, graphics, fhd, ram, ssd, wifi 6, backlit kb, and fpr beats anything out there (there's an asus vivobook that's comparable for a little more and was the last competitor in the running). who knows what the build quality will give me for years of usage but if it's half-decent, it shouldn't become obsolete in just a few. my only complaint as of now is the ever-so-slightly crooked 'full hd 1080' sticker on the left-bottom bezel of the screen, but i'm an ex-qc guy whose eye has been spoiled by too many close inspections. but if anything else wrong appears (knock wood), i'll edit this review.

  This is a pretty good Acer laptop. I have used Acer laptop since 2016 and this model has just been purchased earlier this month. It runs very fast and boots up completely in less than 10 seconds. The i7 core 11th gen quad core CPU with 8 threads and 12 MB cache makes this laptop to handle multi-tasking easily. You can open up more than 20 web browsers without lagging. Thanks for the 16 GB RAM too. However, there's no much discount to buy this laptop now. But the value of the laptop is still lower than same specs Dell, Lenovo, and HP laptops.

  The laptop is super fast, and the performance is amazing. The screen quality is good, but the touchpad is slightly shaking and needs to be fixed, but it is just a minor issue.

  The device itself is in great working order - seems brand new, being that it's refurbished.  HOWEVER, this came to me kinda janky-looking.  It was SPRAY PAINTED.  I understand it's a refurbished product, and I buy them all the time, but this is probably the worst of all the refurbished products, aesthetically-speaking, I've ever bought.  I think it was literally spray painted and then put it a box and shipped to me.  It still reeked of spray paint, seemed a little tacky/sticky still, and there were some paint mistakes and smudges.  I'm giving this to someone as a gift, and am a little embarrassed of the quality of it.  It seems to work fine (which, really, is all that matters) but I'm very disappointed in the physical appearance of the product.

E-mail, facebook, you tube... everything that needs to load or play a video will play and load almost instantly. i dont feel embarrass when doing a presentation because of the little buffering wheel in the scree. I had a 4G RAM AND 64G ROM, it work great never had an issue, it was just old, so i replace it and i wish i would off done it sooner. i need lots of storage but i solve that problem with an external [hard drive] Book. I keep it in my house and as long as it has an internet connection i can access it from anywhere. I strongly recommend itWhen buying a...... Smart Phone,Tablets, Laptop or Desk top, i always look for The RAM, ROM, PROCESSOR and VIDEO/SCREEN QUALITY. For those not familiar or electronic smart, the higher the number the better experience you will have. Lots of people might or might not agree with me. but for those that dont know anything about electronics this will help you a lot. Dont look for the price or the brand unless you care more about Name brands and not performance. Alway try looking for a 6G ROM or better and that will give you an idea. hope this help you a little more.

  Defective product.  Integrated camera will not function; battery life exceptionally short (contrary to seller's claims) wireless connectivity unstable; unit was more than 4 years old. Dell lists as ""warranty expired"" ""unsupported"" not eligible for Dell support or diagnostics.  I would not keep this piece of trash if it were free ( I would probably have to pay a disposal fee).  Seller's listing is false and deceptive.Seller agreed to accept a return of the item-- BUT IS REQUIRING ME TO PAY POSTAGE-- what a ripoff

  The Dell laptop is a great buy and it looks like a new unit. However even more impressive is the seller's customer service. There was a minor problem, and I contacted the seller by email.  They responded in a matter of minutes, we discussed the problem, and the solution is on the way.Very impressive and refreshing to work with a  seller who understands the value of good customer service.  I will be purchasing more units from this seller.

  This laptop looked good for a refurb, a little dent near where a cable plugs in but otherwise very clean. Arrived quickly, and had a good layer of bubble wrap on it. Sadly I have to return it as the mouse does not respond properly, it lags so much and then suddenly works ok, then not. I have not installed anything on the laptop yet so it is not a program I put on it. When I went to return it I didn't have the option to exchange it, so I'm returning it. Hopefully the process goes well. I'll update if needed.

  I don't like giving a bad review. But this laptop just kept shutting down for no reason. We put in all the updates it didn't help. It got worse if the cooling fan came on it would shut down. Sent it back . Still like my other Dell products. Was disappointed with this one not working.

  Solid laptop for the money.  W10 Pro, back-lit keyboard, SSD, nipple mouse if you're into that.  6th gen i5 isn't the newest thing in the world, but its plenty fast for a web/office grinder.  Also has a nice docking port if you want to buy the proprietary Dell dock for another ~35.Only negatives are no cd drive (not really a problem for me) and no removable battery.

  This chromebook is definitely what I hoped it would be.  My other half wanted some type of tablet or laptop or something that he could easily carry with him.  The HP Chromebook fits that and is fast and easy to use.  The battery life exceeds that of my laptop computer.  It arrived earlier than had been projected as delivery date.  The seller emailed a couple weeks after delivery to verify that the product met my expectations and that I had no problems or questions.

  I've purchased refurbished laptops before, and this might be unusual, but they're typically charged up and free of dust, debris, fingerprints and scratches. I have to dive in a little deeper to functionality, but first impression was disappointing. Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old for homework, but I think the scratches and dirt make it less than ideal as a gift. Also, it has a webcam, so if you're getting this for a gradeschool student, just be aware and cover the camera.

  The Build quality is good but some useful features are missing and the performance isn't as good as expected for the price paid.Pros:- Good build quality- The Fans are smooth even when spinning fast, no high pitched whining noise.- Very responsive in web browsing and other various programs- High refresh rate screen- The RTX 3060 is cooled well even under heavy loads- MSI still lets you undervolt the 10th gen Intel CPU's- Good built in audio DACThings I didn't like:- The Intel 10th gen i7, I'm not a fan of the higher end 10th gen Intel chips, they like to run hot and throttle down often which means your not getting all of the performance advertised. Too much tweaking such as undervolting is needed to make them only a little bit better.- No thunderbolt, it didn't keep me from buying but it seems a little odd to not have it when there are two USB C ports.- The RTX 3060 is capped at 75W so it's a max Q, it still does ok but I would have liked a higher watt version.  Perhaps the CPU MSI picked and the heat it generates made this not possible.- The screen isn't very colorful- No SD card slotOverall I'd look at other laptops using a Ryzen or newer Intel CPU when paired with an RTX 3000 graphics card.

  I got this laptop a few days ago and have tested it for nearly 48h.Some things to consider• Pretty good screen for a laptop. 144hz and good looking out of the box• Laptop frame feels solid but isnt overly heavy.• The 6gb RTX 3060 runs games really well. Division 2 averaged over 120 fps at max settings at 1080p. I tested war thunder, escape from tarkov and  mordhau as well and both were extremely smooth (both hit 144hz reliably at ultra 1080p). No noticable input or screen lag in mordhau so fast shooters  will benefit as well.• No noticeable micro stutters when switching from• The laptop top doesn’t feel hot under pressure but I wouldn’t play this on my lap.• I added a 1tb WD Blue NVMe stick to this laptop, its easy to do and there are videos of how to do it.• The GPU runs cool for a laptop (avg 78 under pressure) but the CPU doesn’t. You can fix this by limiting the max power in power settings for the CPU or undervolting it. The cpu has initial spikes in temp but usually ends up in the mid 80s which is a little hot but expected.• Use dragon center to tune the performance. Don’t run extreme performance without cooler boost.• Buy a cooling pad and watch temps for the CPU, the CPU is the only thing that holds this beast back because it tends to hit high temps (95c max from what I saw) if left at max settings.• It has 2x USB3.2and 2x USB-C so you might need to buy an usb dongle. It has a single jack for a headset so you might need to buy a splitter depending on your headset.• One HDMI only. No displayport at all which is something to consider. The HDMI is capable of 4k 60hz but at the end of the day its HDMI. Should be compatible with g sync or g sync supported monitors.

  Really enjoyed the laptop for about a week, but noticed that over time it started to stutter. When I took some thermal measurements I saw the video card was cranking over 90+ C, and it was throttling due to over heating. I returned it and I'll try another laptop.

  I had been using it for over a month, and I really like this computer, the only thing I don't like and I know is a common issue on laptop is heating problems when gaming, CPU temperature tends to rise easily when gaming.The dragon center in msi laptops is a pretty interesting tool, and the cooler booster really helps, but it tends to get loud when its activated.

  Even for the price it's below what you would expect. It might just be my unit, but there were several issues with it out of the box. The screen will black out frequently. The resolution is less than sub-par. It can usually run most things, but will get got quickly. When I'm scrolling the screen will get so unfocused you can't see anything sometimes.

  I got this Laptop 18MAR2 and as soon as I set up everything the screen blacked out a few times within the hour i didnt think much about it and then took it to work the next day so i could set up everything and use it. The screen blacked out multiple times while i was using it decided that i am not going to deal with that issue and return it immediately. I am not going to deal with technical issues on a brand new product that i just got.My biggest complaints while i used it: Screen resolution did not seem very good at all! there was something wrong with the touchpad and it felt cheep, random screen blackouts on a brand new laptop...TLDR: brand new laptop had screen blackout issues, returned immediately.

  No blackout issues here. Seems to be hit or miss on this model. Things I've found so far:1. The color feels washed out when compared to other laptops and desktops we have. After research, this seems to be related to the fact that it only has 6bit color, not 8bit. Changing saturation levels helped some.2. Laptop doesn't wake when you open the lid, and options for this are missing in the power options. Cant fix using cmd, regedit or in the bios as far as I can tell so far. Unclear why.I have updated from winS to win10home. I will update if anything else comes up.

  This ""refurbished"" laptop's overall appearance not bad, no significant scratches or dents on case, just obvious worn areas from previous use.  Not a big deal, it's a used computer.  However, I feel that a ""professionally"" refurbished laptop should not  be sold with an erratic, partially dead touch pad or a battery that does not hold a charge for more than 20 minutes of checking emails.  Can't blame this on HP.  The Amazon Renewed refurbisher obviously allowed a substandard product to leave their facility.

  The laptop itself it's very nice. Took it off the charger & I turned it on last night. Set it up.( It had charged for the last 4 days cause I hadnt been home. ) There were no problems at all.

  I wanted to replace my older HP laptop - it was heavier and therefore not as easy to take with me when I travel as well as not responding as quickly as it used to despite keeping up with the updates and making sure to antivirus software working at all times.  This laptop was a good price and had most of the options that I wanted - the only negative being that it had a DisplayPort option rather than HDMI (I connect a larger monitor to it when using it in my home office).  I did make an error and initially set up OneDrive to use for storage, but since I have a lot of data the included storage space was used up almost immediately, so I reinstalled Windows 10 and disconnected the OneDrive as default. Since I also have Google Drive, it was superfluous to use yet another Cloud option for storing any data that I needed.  I don't use it often on battery but when I have, it's been good, lasting longer than my previous HP.  There are some small issues with it going to sleep unexpectedly (even though I've adjusted the Power Options to not do that) but that's a minor inconvenience. Over all I am glad I purchased this HP Elitebook 840.

  I needed a basic laptop because I work from home and my old one finally gave out. I have a tablet that I love but it is mouseless, and has no USB ports at all which makes doing my work difficult.After looking at the reviews I chose this one.

  As I am progressing further into my software engineering degree, I needed something a bit more powerful than what I was using previously. I couldn't be happier with this laptop! The 8 GB of RAM and the SSD make everything lightning fast. I didn't even know it had a touchscreen when I first got it, so that was a pleasant surprise! The touchscreen has worked well the few times I've used it so far. I'm still waiting to get a good stylus to see how well it actually works.The only gripe that I had was an issue with the integrated webcam. When you activated the camera, for either video or photos, it would turn on and off and on and off forever. After some searching online, I was able to determine there was an issue with the Realtek directories. Going into C:\Program Files\Realtek and renaming the folder in there from ""RsProviders"" to ""RsProviders_"", the problem immediately resolved itself. I'm not sure if that's an issue between Windows and Realtek, or HP and Realtek, or what. But if anyone else runs into this problem, that should be your first solution that you try.

  For the price, this laptop has far exceeded my expectations.  It arrived quickly and in great condition.  There's no fluff in the package as mine arrived with only the laptop and charging cable.

  This model is VERY fast. That’s due to the 16GB of RAM and the SSD drive. It boots really fast and does everything fast. My model also has the fingerprint scanner. I like that too. I recommended this to a friend and she also loved it.The battery life is good but I’ll probably buy s replacement. As you know refurbished seldom includes a new battery.

  Delivered to me within 12 hours of purchase... Sealed in original apple packaging with protective film, blemish free, not a scratch.. Mint.its powerful, Ive already loaded some big task audio software and broadcast software on it and its flying through the multiple processes together at ease... (Logic 10.5 / Traktor DJ 3.0 / OBS)Super light and portable, If this is a MacBook Pro then I can't even imagine how light the Air models are. Nor could I even imagine why you may need something more powerful. I am having to adjust to the new keyboard and Touch Bar, I keep hitting Siri and volume settings, even as I type this.id also recommend getting a keyboard cover as well.... I hear these keyboards go out sometimes and to repair it. This is no fault to the reseller, but I can't believe Apple with their price points don't offer a bigger SSD for the lowest price point.... 128gb is laughable so be prepared to buy an external SSD along with a Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C Hub to run hdmi, and various external accessories.Overall I love this computer so far, it was a nail biter as I rarely ever shell out $1,000 on anything but I'm very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. And I still cannot find a better deal on the internet, not even used on Facebook marketplace, letgo or craigslist....Five stars

I think that they may have fixed the keyboard problem when they refurbished the product??? I'm not sure, but honestly this a really great laptop for a really great price. I do wish that it came in the original Apple box and packaging, but it wasn't far from the really deal.

  So not worth it. All they want to do is take your money do NOT BUY THIS ONE! Its used and if you search apple on amazon they have brand new with higher stats for cheaper.

  Bought this laptop with some apprehensions, as i have typically bought refurbished goods from apple directly. This was my first from amazon, and i was not disappointed. The notebook was flawless, not a single scratch on it. second, all the accessories where flawless as well, not signs of usage. When i powered on the notebook to verify usage, the battery had cycled only 3 times, meaning it was still in new condition. Very highly recommended seller. Thanks for a pleasant transaction.

  It looks and feels brand spanking new! Definitely happy with my purchase considering that I bought a brand new 2020 MacBook Air and hated it. Returned it back in 2 days. I paid a lot less for the Pro than the Air and its A LOT better with so many features. I’m not trying to persuade anyone out of getting the Air but if you are considering on buying a MacBook my advice would be to just go ahead and get the pro. The Air reminds me of a google chrome book slapped with an Apple logo on it. Not saying that google chrome books are bad, but there’s no need to pay a full band for the Air when you could find something similar and a lot cheaper. All in all I really love this laptop.

  Although I was very skeptical about purchasing a ""refurbished"" MacPro, after reading the reviews for this company, I made the purchase.  The MacPro arrived earlier than expected, expertly wrapped, included Apple certified, and in NEW condition.  There is no way I could tell it was not new or refurbished.  The price was the best I could find after researching other sellers.  I would highly recommend iPower Resale Inc to anyone looking for a MacPro.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Thank you for a great product!  5*****

  I’ve only had the laptop for a month but I’m very pleased with it. I am not very tech savvy but it was very easy to set up. It takes you step by step through the process. I was a little nervous about it but it was quick and painless. The screen quality is good. I do not do any gaming on it so I can’t speak on that. I mainly use it for email, shopping online, and some Microsoft office things. I would recommend this laptop. It’s light weight too.

  Great laptop for basic tasks. Lightweight, easy to use, and a beautiful display. Touch pad took some getting used to, but does the job no problem. Great for email and browsing on the go. I installed and run office 365 with no issues. Allows me to do the things I need to do on the go. Videos are great quality but speakers are a bit weak. No problem though, I just use headphones. A great buy for a 14 inch Windows 10 laptop. I believe the negative reviews are from people demanding way too much from a computer in this price range. If your intent is web browsing, videos, email, and some spreadsheets or such it's perfect! Exactly what I needed at a great price! If you're on the fence about this one, well don't be.

  I purchased this laptop for one purpose, to use Adobe Cloud products for my business. You can't beat the price for what you get with this laptop. Although I feel that the keyboard is a little 'chinsy', it works perfectly fine. Overall this laptop is perfect for my needs. It is very light so if you need to lug it around anywhere, it's quite easy to do so. I would recommend this laptop to anyone in the market for one. As I stated, I am using it for one purpose so don't have much on it. I haven't used it to stream movies from Netflix for example, I don't play video games so I can't speak to those things.

  Was very pleased that the item shipped rather quickly. Windows set up is an absolute turn off especially if you don’t have an existing account - no fault of the manufacturer/shipper. However, my two draw backs are the fact that you must purchase additional items for disc space as this device doesn’t really have a lot to run programs and this was advertised as a laptop but when I received - it is a lapbook.  Meaning it’s really like a tablet.It extremely light weight. You must make additional purchases to fully open and use programs such as google. I purchased this item for my son to access the internet through google for school. We will add the additional space so that he’s able to use properly. For the orice it’s not a bad buy.

  Just needed a second PC computer for some work-related activities that my Mac couldn’t handle (it’s also quite old but I do t see any reason to replace it). I got this since the other reviews seemed quite good, it’s not as fast with loading high content things, so I wouldn’t recommend for gaming or video-editing activities as I don’t think the processing would keep up, but works fine for basic word processing, spreadsheets, email, etc (streaming is fine, just buffers a bit more/longer than my other computer). Also, this computer does run Windows, but it’s in S-mode meaning you’ll need to turn that off if you want to download any app/program that is NOT from the Microsoft store. It’s easy to do, just google instructions and you’ll be fine, and same goes for when you need to download a program and you get the error message “this download blocked by administrator....” in which you ARE THE ADMINISTRATOR, just google that too, lots of tutorials online on how to get around that as well.

  The only thing I have to complain about so far is the sensitivity of the touch pad.  I have to be careful not to hover over it when I'm typing as several times my cursor has jumped on me.  This is however, my first lap top so my experience using laptops is low.That said, I would have given it a 4.6 if I could have.  I'm new to the lap top scene, and I love this computer so far.  It is so easy to use and the portablity is amazing, even though it is a 14 incher.  I think this size balances nicely between being too small (I like a bigger screen) and being to large to cart around.  I went with windows as that is what I am familiar with, and the computer is very user friendly.I am inexperienced with a lap top but this one meets my needs and is great.

  My other laptop was older and heaver as it had a CD-rom which I didn't use enough. Plus the hinge broke in the old one. Just to buy the part and then have it installed was more than I was willing to pay. I came across this laptop, very thin, light weight and great for what little I use it.

  This was lightweight and slim like a chromebook, but better because you can easily plug it in to a printer and various other normal laptop functions.  Unfortunately, I needed to return it because it wouldn't work for its intended purpose--the keystone online summer school.  This laptop did download the required 64 bit JAVA, but it would not work with the school's software.  We took it to a technician, but he couldn't get it to access the course either.  He guessed it was the processor, and that the school likely did not understand what the technical requirements should be.

  I acquired this machine after having a Toshiba S55T-C5165 for almost 7 years. Unfortunately my Toshiba suffered a processor damage which could no longer be fixed.This MSI is by far a better option than the other brands that exist in the market.It is super fast, fluid in the processes that I carry out that are related to my profession such as electrical engineering, I have no problems running simulators, computer-aided drawing programs such as autocad, solidworks, among others.In addition, all the complementary software programs such as the Dragon Center are an excellent alternative to have control of the cooling of the machine by accessing the revolutions of the fans.The battery life is 7-8 hours with a heavy workload and with all the brightness and definition of the screen it is astonishing.The only problem I found is that in the Dragon Center when the automatic fan selection is left set, the laptop turns off with some games, just at the moment the third fan is turned on, however this does not happen with simulators. that I use for my work.To solve this problem with the games I have chosen to create a custom ventilation mode and with this I solved it.Apart from that, in this month of use I have not had any additional problems.

Again very nice laptop with almost no physical damage. There is indeed a slight scratch on the screen but bearable.

Overall computer is OK for the price and battery working fine but still there shouldn't be false information in the product description.

  I thought I was getting a great deal-I was so wrong. After 3 months the battery no longer holds a charge.

  This laptop was a problem from day 1.  I did successfully get through to SkyTech with the first issue, just days after receiving the laptop.  Windows was not registering, so bios, then blue screen ""Cannot find Windows"".  I followed instructions they sent me and got that corrected.  Then COVID19 hit and I when I discovered the next problem, SkyTech was radio silent.  I have called no less than 12 times and sent emails, but no responses or call backs.  Now I am months out of my return window, have never successfully gotten to use this paperweight and just want my money back.  There is a hardware problem with this laptop and I cannot have it be down any longer.  I cannot wait for customer service, once they do respond to tell me that I have to send it back to them, they will fix it and send it back in a month.  I need a perfectly working replacement sent out to me and this one taken back.

  Good laptop! I would recommend this. There are a few caveats and some problems (though I suspect this was just bad luck) but first the arguments for it.-well packaged. The unit came strapped tight under stretch plastic and was securely packaged for transport.-good physical condition. I would agree that this is ""A"" grade in its overall physical condition and marks of wear. It could be characterized as ""gently used"".-decent battery life still. I get a good 4 hours of life from the battery despite the age of the platform (2016) under ""normal"" usage. Word, excel, browser, some YouTube.-6th generation Core i5 platform with USB-C. This alone makes going for 6th gen (over 5th and 4th) worth it.-Smart card reader. This is very useful to me (and one of the primary reason I went for this HP series of laptops) as my organization uses smart cards extensively.Now for the ""cons"".-screen is not 1080p despite being advertised as ""FHD"". It's your usual low-grade, washed-out looking ""HD"" panel with 1366x768 (these laptops are built using a wide variety of options and parts). Not a deal breaker, but just so you're aware, you may not get an actual 1080p panel (which is what ""FHD"" means).-Large decal on the lid. Kind of baffling, the lid has a decal that covers the entire lid. It has a ""brushed aluminum"" appearance and texture to it. Makes me think that the lid might have ugly mark(s) on it that the decal is covering. Not a deal breaker, just an unusual thing for me to see.-Damaged SSD. The laptop came with a bad SSD. The refurbisher utilized a 256GB Adata SU650 SSD that initially worked, Windows 10 got set up and rebooted, but then would keep going into chkdsk (storage check for data integrity) and upon scanning it, come to find out, smart errors/bad blocks. I swapped it out for a Western Digital Blue 512GB SSD and then everything was fine.All in all, for $350 this laptop is a good value for what you get in return. If the SSD hadn't been shot, and if the panel was 1080p instead of half HD, this would represent an outstanding value. But as it is, this is okay.

  Bought this for my son to have for school and games on steam. Works pretty good. Going to add another 8gb of ram. Overall the laptop is good. It has a few scuffs and scratches on the lid. It comes with a really cheap power adapter that gets really hot. My biggest complaint to the seller is it was dirty. There where Cheetos or cracker crumbs all around the screen and keyboard. That’s was gross especially with the Covid pandemic going on.

  Amazing laptop, awesome graphics, solid keyboard.  Buy the way, I love the backlit keyboard (use F5 to turn this on).  I've seen lots of complaints about this laptop about slow WiFi, bad touchscreen, keyboard does not light up, etc.  Any new computer or laptop will require some ""setup"". You don't really have to be a computer expert.  Uninstall bloatware. This is preinstalled programs (mostly games) that you'll never use. Also, download and install the required updates.  This may require one or two restarts to get the updates installed. This can  all be done in settings (Windows key, gear icon).

  I bought this for my senior parents so we could video conference w. live close caption for one of my parents.  My criteria was: inexpensive (check); big screen (check); touch screen (check); good camera (check); good speakers (check); big keyboard (check); good performance (check).So this seemed to check all the boxes and overall I am very happy with this computer for its purpose.  However, I didn't consider the keyboard visibility.  I got the silver so the keys are silver with no actual printed/contrasting letters - it relies 100% on the backlight and clear cutouts to let the light through.  So even I can barely see them and the backlight (silver next to light, yes think about it) actually makes it worse.  This is a major major design flaw.  This is why no 5 stars.I'm keeping the machine but purchasing some big letter stickers to put on the keyboard...hope that works!

  I bought this computer for school work and business. It is so loud it is hard to focus over the sound of the fan nonstop whistling/blowing. At first I thought it would just be a minute or two, but after 10 minutes of the constant loud noise, I thought maybe It was overheating, even though it didn't feel hot. I stopped using it for about 20 minutes came back turned it back on, and nope...started right back up. For a computer that is almost 700 dollars, I don't think the fan should be that loud, nor do I think that it should be so constant that I am unable to concentrate

  This laptop is a scam. They claim it has a solid state drive in it and it clearly has a hard disk drive. If you put your ears near the touch pad you can hear the disk being read and writeen. It is slow and I'm returning it. (Not an average joe when I write this review, I'm an electrical and computer engineer.

  This computer with the SSD operating system drive is fast to start, fast to launch programs, and quick to respond. I don't know about gaming but it does Outlook, Excel, browsers, and Zoom conferences with ease. It’s nice to finally have a computer I don't have to wait on to be productive.

  Bought it as a gift, but I set it up before delivering it.  Really sharp display.  Lightweight for a 15.6"".  Good sound. I like the backlit keyboard.  IMO, touch screen on a traditional laptop is of little use (but giftee wanted it).Touchpad confused me greatly.  I couldn't figure out how to access right button functions.  Eventually discovered it does have left and right button functionality at the bottom of the pad, but I didn't see any visual indication of that.  (I have been using mice since 1978 and generally plug one in for anything more than a brief session).All around a very nice laptop.

  This computer is lite, super quick and offers everything needed for anyone in school or working from home. My only complaint, battery life is not the greatest.  Would like to see at least 8 to 10 hours of use before needing a charge.

  This machine is 2 weeks old and has an annoyingly noisy fan. Looked up fixes online, and they require actions like 'upgrade the BIOS,' that I'm not comfortable doing. Grrrrrr.

  For some backstory, I have never been one to buy a product based on its peripherals, such as touchscreen, or keyboard, or anything of that nature. I've always wanted pure power. My first few laptops were purchased based on me weighing how fast it is for the buck.This purchase was different because I had different goals in mind for a laptop. My goal for this purchase was to have the perfect laptop for note taking in college (and to save the hundreds of wasted loose leaf paper used to practice my 5 mathematics courses). The only option for me was a 2 in 1 laptop. After some research, this laptop seemed to give the most bang for the buck. So, here I am!This laptop surprised me in just how premium it felt. It was much thinner than any other laptop I've ever owned, yet it felt sturdier and more secure. Probably because it is made of metal, as opposed to a cheap plastic. I feel like This laptop wont just out of nowhere, have a damaged hinge, like my last laptop did, even though I didn't drop it or anything. It is strong and feels really nice. The metal is a nice matte aluminum, so it feels nice to the touch and doesn't smudge easily.In terms of the performance of this laptop, it is really impressive. This specific laptop in the spin 5 series has impressive stats in every sector of computing. Very nice CPU, with the i7, a lot of ram at high speeds (3200 MHZ I think), and a super speedy NVMe SSD, which makes this thing load stuff almost instantly. It even turns on from being booted off almost instantly. Its very nice and perfect for people who need a computer that is usable the instant that they need it.The touchscreen with the wacom pen is amazing, plain and simple. The touchscreen feels better than my smart phone, so obviously I think its great, and the pen feels almost like i'm writing on paper. More like a slightly sticky whiteboard, but still. Because of that, I believe that 98% of what I write down next semester will be on this bad boy. It just completely replaces pen and paper. Now I can feel better because I am not wasting so much paper.Now for some downsides. The screen aspect ratio is stupid. Yes, I said it, having a taller screen is a thing of the past yet this laptop thought it could get away with it. It looks stupid and feels stupid. Videos now have huge upper and lower black bars, which wastes screen real estate. They even advertise the taller screen as a feature, as if it is a new technology. Come on!This laptop is kind of hard to open. You definitely need two hands to do it and you have to tilt it up to where the hinge is down and the part that it opens is facing up and then you have to pry it open. I think its like this because of the magnets they use to keep it closed. Its not the worst thing, because of how I love this computers features, but It does annoy me.The touchpad is hard to click with. You have to press pretty hard so it makes clicking a little clunky. It isn't the end of the world, but mac books are definitely easier in this sector.And that is about it in the cons department. I highly recommend this product. If you don't mind the cons that I listed, this laptop is perfect for being on the go!

  I bought this laptop for 2 reasons; the 16GB/512GB extra storage, and the active stylus.First the bugs; there's no way to know these things until after I bought it. The charger isn't a USB-C which is the new fad, it's one of the old style. The charger is much smaller and lighter than the others I have used, so that's a plus worth mentioning, just not as small as a phone charger... The USB-A port doesn't go all the way in - on both sides (WTF?) the USB-C ports do though. The SD card slot has a similar problem of sticking out too far for comfort. The stylus position is right next to a screw hole, so a few times I have tried to rip out the screw trying to pull the stylus out... You have to get used to the position, or actually pull up the side to check where you are grabbing - it's just way too close. There is a noticable gap between the base and screen, with a fan out the back trying to use that space for ventilation - which isn't used well since the laptop heats up (this is when using a heavy data-cruncher) to an almost un-holdable temperature in just a few minutes. During 'normal' usage, the temperature is well regulated and comfortable, but under high loads it can't be on a lap.Sound and video are superb =) I wasn't looking for high quality video, but my expectations were exceeded. Great for binging. The battery lasts (these are guesses, not calculations) for ~8 hours doing text editing, ~6 hours binging on youtube, but only ~2 doing data crunchingSecond the stylus. I need a stylus to write math formulas down during video conferencing. It works pretty accurately, but the main problem is that the screen is too flimsy to support writing on it even if i try to put my other hand behind the monitor. If I try to rotate to tent-mode the writing works better, but the camera can't figure out how to flip itself (and there are no app options to flip the camera vertically), and similarly I can't just put it down flat because it wants to change to tablet mode, and can't see me on the ceiling...The big problem with the stylus I found out when I contacted customer service. I expected to get a few extra tips for the stylus in the box, but no. I asked if they sell the tips - they don't. I asked which tips are the right size - they don't know. I asked what styluses are compatible - they said the one it comes with. I asked if they sell the stylus itself - they do, but they don't know how much it costs unless they order it (WTF?) and can't order one unless the original is broken... So the one tip on the one stylus is all you get if you buy this. When I was using it I also found out the hard way that the stylus battery only lasts about an hour, but can be recharged in just a few seconds. Very disappointed in the no-replacement of the stylus.Third the storage; The RAM is 16GB of DDR4-3200 dual-lane. I don't know why they can't say that in the tech specs, but they didn't. The hard drive is 512GB, but came with 50-60GB pre-filled.

  This computer is awful, it lags on every site and app, won't allow me to connect to the wifi in my house. Seller would only give 20% back for a return so I'm stuck with this peice of junk.

  I bought this in order to work from home. Per our work IT guys,  it has malfunctioning wifi and out of date drivers.  I lost signal all the time sitting 2 feet from my router. After installing a wifi extender (which took all day to download), I can sit at my table 10 feet away from the router,  but drop signal all the time. This is a piece of junk,  don't waste your money. I'm stuck because I have to have something to work from home with & can't afford to buy a new one while waiting for a refund on this one.

  I bought this computer as a back-up machine that I can use for basic work if my desktop computer is in the shop. This laptop appears to be fine for that purpose.On the downside, Microsoft encourages use of its ""S mode."" Since I was prompted to use S mode during the set up of this computer, I chose S mode.  I soon regretted doing so when I learned that S mode blocks the installation of third-party software like Chrome. It's tough to get Windows 10 out of S mode, and I ended up taking this computer to a local tech service. That tech service charged me almost $300 to get this laptop working properly!So if you want to download and install third-party software on this computer, DO NOT choose S mode during set up.

  Excellent laptop to have. I fell in love with this laptop right away and it’s a great price for what you get.Pros:-Great size screen-Starts up super fast-Light weight and thin-Great for using Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom.-Plays the Sims 4 (base game and ALL expansions) on highest settings, flawlessly.-Holds a great charge if you are doing internet browsing or basic tasks on your computer.-Touchscreen works nicely. Only have used it a few times because I’m not a fan of using this for a constant touchscreen use. Just not my style, but it does work very nice.-Speakers/sound is very nice-Downloads are super fast-Easy to use and set upCons:-Says it comes with a 125 GB of storage on it, in reality it’s more like 70 GB. However, easy fix is to but an external drive. I use a Toshiba 2 TB external drive (around $60 on here and works amazingly) and use it has an extension of the laptop, problem solved.-when you unplug the charger the screen dims making it hard to edit photos or do any photoshop work.-Does not play highly detailed games well, it lags.All in all, I highly recommend this laptop to almost anyone. If you are a basic gamer this works very nice, but if you are more advanced in gaming, don’t get this. If your games are very detailed or take up a lot of storage, this will not work for you. It will lag (if you’re lucky to have the space to install). But if you like Sims, Minecraft, Roblox...you’re all set. Same goes for if you do any photo editing or any digital illustration work. Pretty much any Adobe program works flawlessly on this.

  My husband purchased this laptop for me after my old laptop, which I had for almost 7 years, went out on me. He purchased this in April and I started having issues with it a few weeks ago. Took it to my brother who is a programmer and he said that the pc randomly shutting down on me, the laptop taking forever to load anything (which he did a speed test on and said the internet was fine), the screen shorting out and blinking on me was the PC failing on me. After 6 months. SIX MONTHS! I only use this laptop for work if I'm home, which isn't often. I've used it probably two-3 times a week for a few hours since I got it. I do not recommend this product at all.

  So I bought a razer laptop here in 2021. It arrived basically dead on arrival. I thought no big deal, got a replacement. Razer sent me a second computer that had a different horrible problem. Then their customer service was a garbage fire.That’s what brought me to this. I bought this computer since my entire desktop pc build was using asus parts. Man they hit it out of the park with this laptop.  If you are on the fence on what brand you should get, don’t be. Asus is the way to go. This thing plays every game I’ve thrown at it at ultra graphics with rtx on (when available) and it handles it with no problem.Things to know. The thing gets pretty loud when pushing the machine. But it stays pretty cool considering it’s this thin. There is no webcam, but it does have a finger print sensor for fast log in.Another big con here, because of the shortage of gaming hardware this seller is doing a bit of a price gouge. Msrp on this thing is supposed to be 1800ish. So I’d wait it out if you wanna buy it for the right price. But if you need something now I highly recommend.

  Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, but there are few but's.- When gaming the laptop microphone becomes totally useless because of the fairly loud fans. All this noise suppression is useless too.- One particular game made the screen go wild with RGB lines. After a certain amount of time. No other game would do so, so i don't know what the problem is. Also this same game works flawlessly on other PC's.- Playing with speakers is almost useless because of the loud fans. Having headphones helps.Other than that i'm very impressed with this beast. Makes gaming very comfortable/portable.

  So far this has been a great laptop. I do have a minor complaint about not having the camera installed though, but not a big deal.Overall the overclocking software gives you some flexibility to get higher frames in your games. The ergo-lift is great because it offers much better airflow, not sure why more manufacturers don't do this.The panel is much better than other panels I have used, having 1440P at your fingertips rather than a 1080P made me appreciate this laptop much more.You can upgrade the RAM, though the RAM is soldered you will be able to run dual channel regardless up to 16GB depending on your soldered RAM amount (8 GB soldered and you add a 32GB RAM, you will have 16GB running in dual channel and the rest in single channel).This is a lower wattage card, if I am correct it is 80W with a dynamic boost up to 100W. So, this is a MAX-Q, do not be confused thinking this is a full 3070 card like these manufacturers are abusing the confusion.As of my writing on 3/23/2021 I would not suggest purchasing this laptop for $2500 as posted on Amazon currently, MSRP is $1799, do not pay this premium unless you absolutely need it.

  This windows laptop is a good basic computing workhorse. It does have intel cpu, but lacks usb-c ports and does not have a lighted keyboard. I do like that larger 15” screen and the dedicated number pad.The screen display is a TFT and not LED so the brightness is sufficient, but it is not a super crystal clear compared to newer tech. The built in sound and microphone plus webcam is good for for zoom and conferencing. I do use a riser to get a better angle but it’s not necessary.I do feel that the computing speed is adequate for business and general needs but for gaming, I would want a better display.The laptop does have 2 USB 3.0 ports but no usb-c.

  very upset. The computer was fast but not very good for gaming or school. Camera quality was terrible it was like black and white and very laggy. Also after just 3 days with it the mouse of stoped working. Although it says it has good storage this is not so true you can barely download anything and when u do it takes forever.

   I recently purchased this Mrmayodou laptop computer and I must say I am impressed with a lot of the features and performance that it has. It comes with a built in Intel x64-based Celeron J4115 Quad Core processor and so it works pretty fast when surfing the web or using various software applications. It is pre-installed with Windows 10,  has 8GB RAM, and 128GB M.2 SATA SSD, which makes it an ideal laptop for basic home use and my kids school work while at home. It also allows for an SD or micro SD card to allow up to 128GB of memory storage. It comes with 2.4GHzand 5GHz capability with WIFI as well.  .The laptop also has a good size screen being  15.6 inches and lightweight being around 3.74lbs pounds that makes it ideal for transport when I am traveling with my job. It is also equipped with resolution that is  1920 x 1080 and integrated with Intel HD Graphics  for a great picture which gives the display a crisp and vibrant color that makes it a great computer for games, movies, and of course for daily use. It is also wifi and bluetooth capable. It has a great battery life that lasts up to 6 hours that is nice when I am on the go and can't be near a place to charge it. It has a precision touchpad that makes navigation on it an easy process.Overall, I am impressed with the quality, durability, and design of this laptop and will be using it alot for all my online and work needs
