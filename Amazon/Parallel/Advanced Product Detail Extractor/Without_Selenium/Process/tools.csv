  I testes this water filter to see if it was working. I used the test stick that came with my ZERO water pitcher. So, I tested the water from the TAP. 269 PPM than I tested the water through the refrigerator water filter PPM was only 243 only a change of 10 PPM (PARTICLES PER MILLION). So, I ran 2 gallons of water through the water system in the refrigerator thinking maybe it needs a break in period. Mind you the family has been using the new filter through the refrigerator for about a week now.  Still only 243 PPM. Thank I took the same water from the refrigerator and ran it through the ZERO water filter, and you know what the test stick came back with 000 PPM.So, this filter is a total scam. I don’t think most will go fare to test to see if the filter is working like I did. But for $45 I needed to make sure it works. But it failed miserably. I would have been happy if it came back with 150 PPM, but only a 23-point change heck no. I sent it back. TO bad Zero water doesn't make a refrigerator water filter..

  Do not buy from this source.  These are defective filters. I replaced the old filter with the one I received from Amazon ( having done this many times before) and the new filter made a grinding motor sound and barely dripped water.  I re-installed several times with the same result.  I subsequently went to Home Depot and bought the same filter which installed and worked perfectly on the first try. They are selling defects.  Do not buy from this source.

  This filter works fine as a replacement for W10295370 or W10295370A. Lots of confusion on model numbers and what fits so I am putting a photo here to help clarify.  P4RFWR, W10295370(A) and EDR1RXD1 are all the same, fit wise.Just installed in a Maytag MSF22D4XAW00 so time will tell how well this one performs, rather expensive for a filter, however.

  Original September purchase: product came in original manuf packaging, fits well and works fine.12 March Update #2: went for more water and got the hammering sound.  Upon opening the filter cartridge area, the paper towel I used to pad the cartridge is now soaked.  Redid papertowel (little thicker) and when I went back to check on it a couple hours later, paper towel getting wet again.  Just submitted a refund request.  Will try to buy from a brick/mortar store to see if I have better luck or even try to find an alternate option.  Will see what works!12 March Update: bought again but had issues when I installed it.  I’d get a hammering noise and then no water would flow.  Searched high and low for the ‘how to fix’ and found it on a YouTube video.  The latest cartridge I received was ever so slightly smaller than the last one, so it was making a complete seal when the filter compartment lid was closed.  So upon advice from the YouTube video I put in a folded piece of paper towel (about 1/4 sheet folded up) btwn cartridge and door and Voila - it worked w/out issued!  No hammering noise and water flows freely.  Will update again if this changes anytime soon!

  Everydrop filter 1 is a fair product, but I think it is quite expensive as a refrigerator filter. I have a big household, a family of five with two dogs, our daily water need is quite high. The water flow with filter 1 is time-consuming to fill a cup of water, especially when everybody gets home around the same time and all want some ice water. Therefore, I recommend any household over four to purchase a water filter system rather than rely on the filtered water through the refrigerator. We recently switched to an under sink Waterdrop reverse osmosis water filtration system. Though it is pricy to purchase in the first place, the system definitely satisfied our water need and the replacement filters are also affordable considering the filter life and replace frequency. The system is also quite stylish and only takes very little space. I use the filtered water to make coffee and fresh OJs for my family in the morning and they all love it. I think the major reason is that the system reduces a great percentage of TDS in the original water, which the water after filtration is not that “hard.”I used to find those ugly white scale deposits pile up on my kettle, but I do not have to deal with it anymore with the help of this RO system.

  I was skeptical about buying the water filter after all the negative reviews, but it surprised me. My fridge was new and this is the first time I had to change the filter. Whatever filter was already IN the fridge had a terrible plastic taste so I was concerned that it would stay around with the new filter. To my big surprise it was much better. I only drink spring water and have drank from the filter and liked it- it had no after taste or plastic taste anymore. I did have some air bubbles following the filter change but it does go away after a little while. I made sure to run the water before the first use (as directed) although I didn't measure the water so was it exactly however many gallons??? No idea! I am very happy with my purchase and will only order this filter for my Whirpool fridge.

  This item works. I purchased a different product that was half the price that did not work. This is the only filter thst works on my whirlpool side by side fridge/freezer. And, these filters only last me about 2 to 3 months. Getting expensive to use. Maybe it's my water pipes,I don't know,I'm on city water in florida. But it plugs up about every 3 months,and I need replace. Update: I discovered that the filter does not insert into the holder tight enough, to solve, put a small piece cardboard,or folded paper towel between end of filter and door that closes onto it. Forcing the filter tight into position.  That is what causes many issues people are having with their filter,hammering, low output, noise, leaking etc. It needs be pushed tight into housing. Test by just pushing in on it while dispensing water. Trust me, it's the issue.

  Better flow than the ones that came with the fridge and subjectively the water seems to taste better. I've read this one filters out fluoride better than the old factory ones did, though I haven't tested that. Stupid expensive for a filter though. They've got us cornered with the custom filter type.

  Absolute trash. Didn’t hold very light picture frames. They fell off the wall in the middle of the night and broke the picture frames, scratched the wall through the paint and dry wall and dented the hardwood. Not only am I out the $$$ for the stupid hangers, I now have to repair the wall, replace the frames, and look at the dent in our floor. Oh! And obviously now rehang the pictures. Do yourself a favor and save the $ and time and just use a hammer and nail.

  OK - I've never used these and was skeptical, but I really wanted to hang some artwork without damaging the walls - or at least to be able to remove the artwork without any mark on the walls.  I did it and they are holding even on a fairly heavy plaque!  I have some heavier art with heavy frames that I'm not sure these would work for!  But I am reordering these because they really work and make picture hanging so easy!!!!

  Every now and then I can't get it to attach to something right but in their defense it's usually because I don't give it enough time to adhere to the surface. If you're having trouble with it sticking make sure you give it a good amount of time before you actually connect the stripes and put a load on the stripes. If they don't have time to settle it'll just fall off the wall.

   If you’re skeptical and wondering which of the many many led strip lights to get. Be glad you found this one. None of the other can seem to stick properly. But with this one I can stick and restick as many times as needed!! Awesome bonus in case you misplaced or want to redesign. The lights spaced perfectly apart, and the remote is very responsive. The DIY section is awesome, you can program it any way you want.

   This review is for the “65.6ft Led Strip Lights, Tenmiro Ultra-Long RGB LED Lights Strip 5050 LED Tape Lights Flexible Color Changing LED Lights with 44 Keys IR Remote for Bedroom, Kitchen, DIY Home Decoration(4X16.4ft)” sold by NIGHTSPARKLEIncluded in the box is a remote, a power-brick style power supply (12v DC 5A), 4 spools of LED Strip lights, the IR based controller, an IR remote (with 4 legs to connect the 4 strips to), connecting hardware, and a small brochure.The lights on the strip can be set on a good array of colors.  When selecting a color or pattern, the same color and pattern goes across all 4 strips.  These LEDs are NOT individually addressable.  If you want to have that functionality, like light chasing patterns, or each LED to be of a different color than its neighbors, then you need to look at a different style of LED Strip (look for DREAMCOLOR or “Chasing LED’s” in the descriptions).The lights are NOT WEATHER PROOF or WATERPROOF.  These lights were designed to be in an indoor configuration as the diodes for the LED are simply surface mounted and exposed to the environment with no protection on a carrier strip.  So behind a TV, under inside cabinets and molding, and accent lights for a room or under a bed would be a great place to put these.The adhesive on the strip looks to be “just barely strong enough” to hold it in place. So if you intend to have it mounted for a longer time, I would suggest looking into adding or replacing the adhesive that comes with the strips or using some mounting hardware or dedicated LED strip mounting channels. If you want to beef up the adhesive, 3M makes great adhesive tapes for this need.The strip itself is basically a flexible circuit board where the diodes and other surface mount components are affixed.  The LEDs are 50x50mm and each LED carrier contains separate diodes for Red, Green, or Blue in the physical package.  While this configuration does give great color for the 3 primary colors, giving combinations of colors (like an orange, or a yellow, or a white) is not as pure as what you might be expecting, but all in all still pretty good. The strips have cut areas about every 6.5” so you can trim the length of the strip to match most desired lengths.  Each section has 3 LED packages on it, giving an equivalent of 3 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Blue LED’s per strip.  There is no additional “white” LED (cold or warm) on this strip.If you do choose to cut and splice, make sure you get the 4 conductor connectors for LED strips. It is possible to buy extra connecting hardware to splice back in cut lengths together — however, I would suggest keeping the total length of one powered run as what was provided by the factory — unless you can engineer in more +12V power supplies.  From what I have seen as “standard issue”, a 12V 1.25A supply should power 1 leg of 5M (16.5’) of LEDs.The Remote is Infra-Red — you have to point the remote at the IR LED that comes off the controller.  If you don’t have a clear line of sight between the remote and the controller, you won’t be able to control the lights.  If you want to have it so that you can control it via Radio signals, look for a replacement controller that does support RF operations.This controller is NOT MUSIC / SOUND sensitive.The Power supply is sufficient to power the four included rolls of LED Strip lighting with no apparent issues. The power supply cord from the wall to the power brick is a little on the short side ( about 18” ) and the length from the power brick to the barrel connector was about 3 feet — and is as usually expected for a generally sourced 12v 5A power adapter. It is 2 pronged which is typical for the US power grid, and this version did not have interchangeable power connectors in case you wanted to install these in UK, FR, etc.So, again, these strips function as specified, so no issues there.  Just make sure that these give you the ability to get you the quality of light you need and only use these indoors in an average humidity environment.

   Works perfectly! Very bright and is adjustable if I want it dimmer. Many colors to choose from and very responsive. The adhesive seems very sticky and didn’t come off easily so I’m expecting it to stay on for a very long time.

  As part of her room redecoration, my daughter wanted to add strip lights around the entire ceiling. I was happy to find set that was actually long enough for the entire ceiling without having to find strips to add to it. We looked at several different sets for not only the features of the lights, but the remote control as well. My daughter wanted this remote because of the way she could get the colors adjusted, the ability to dim them, and the ability to change the sequence, all very easily from one remote without having to use her phone. She put them up herself without any assistance from me and she's only 12 years old. None of the strip has fallen or puckered. The set is actually 4 strips with connectors. The connectors blend in and are virtually unseen.

   Got these lights to spruce up my room. Very easy to install and operate. They are even foldable so you don’t have to worry about going in 90 angles with these lighting strips. I do wish there was a better way to connect the four light strips that came in the box. Better yet I wish it had all been one roll. Either way, amazing lights!

  I was a little bit nervous to put these up, as I was never really sure how they worked, but the strips were fairly easy to set up. The instructions were somewhat unclear as to the connection of a series of strips. For those as bamboozled as myself: cut the end off the first strip, cut the beginning off of the second strip, and use the included plastic snap connectors to create a continuous strip of light. Make sure the strips are in the correct orientation with the contacts matching on both sides. You can bend the metal arms on the inside of the plastic connector if you have difficulty getting the ends of the strips inserted.Otherwise, these are more or less your typical basic LED strips. They provide excellent mood lighting but aren't sufficiently luminous for visually intensive tasks. These particular strips are somewhat lacking in features, with four non-customizable color changing modes and no Bluetooth support. The remote and receiver have enough range for any standard sized bedroom, but the control box must be within line of sight due to the use of infrared. This small issue is exacerbated by the unnecessarily short power lead. The cord is barely able to reach my outlet from 10ft ceilings.One last thing worth mentioning is that these go further than I would have expected. I only needed about two and a half of the four strips included to line the perimeter of my ceiling. Ultimately, I think that these are plenty functional for the price, bearing in mind the caveats previously mentioned.

  They work well AFTER you get an o-ring to seal them.  After seeing the issue others have, water leaking AROUND the filter instead of going through it, and making very certain it was correctly seated, I put a thin rubber o-ring around the filter (most hardware stores carry these) which is reusable (I've had one o-ring for 7 filters so far).  The o-ring makes seating it firmer as I push the filter in, and SEALS the filter so water must go through it.  Get a thin one, it must fit between the filter and the wall of the insert area.  I put the ring about 3/4"" from the top of the filter, then push it in, and I can feel the o-ring ""rolling"" up the filter as I push and it seats the filter in very firm and tight.  **See pics.  This about a 2"" o-ring, and they are cheap.  Brita should use this idea and send a small o-ring with each 3 pack or pitcher. I think people who are complaining about the water quality don't realize the water is leaking around the filter and not being filtered.  After the O-Ring, it takes MUCH longer for the water to go through the filter, so I know it's working.

  Waste of money.  I bought these refills in addition to the pitcher.  I was sick for a month, couldn't figure out why, then I read more reviews on line.  100's of folks had the same horrible gastric symptoms, headaches, and didn't know why until this commonality was discovered in a group.  I cannot say for sure, but when 100's of people are having the same complaints while using, then the symptoms cvompletely go away after stopping... you be the judge.

  Here I am writing a separate review for these filters. Total waste of time and money. Kept the pitcher in my fridge and away from light as much as I can, only when pouring water and I got Algae / mold. I researched and read that here that people were having the same problem. I contacted Brita / Clorox for help, and all I got was the same ""copy and paste"" answer. So disappointing. We're people here Brita, please show some compassion for us consumers using our hard earned money buying your product to improve our lives a little bit.

  If you have a Brita jug, you'll probably need a pack of these.  I live in San Jose, and the water here is ridiculous.  It comes out orange sometimes, and it smells like rotten eggs.  We did a water test and we even called an inspector to test it as well, both said the water meets the standard (whatever that means).The filters help a lot.  The water comes through clear, tastes fine, smells fine.  After about a month, there's a definite layer of a powdery orange something on the bottom of our dispenser and so I clean it and switch out the filter.  The package says to switch the filter out every two months.  No, we don't go through an exceptional amount of water (it's just my husband and myself, and I drink less than a glass of water a day ... no joke, yes I know it's not healthy).  We tested a sample of the sediment water as well, the test found nothing harmful and we're not dead yet so I guess we'll just keep drinking it, whatever it is.

  Very easy to install/insert. Filtering process is not fast, as it is filtering your water from contaminants. It is NOT going to be fast, as some of the 1 and 2 star users have complained. It is doing it's job - making clear, clean, tasty water by filtering, but it does not take long (less than 4 minutes to fill a pitcherful).Have purchased this 3 pack four times (each filter lasts around 90 days). Very inexpensive for the job that they perform - and these are the OEM Brita filters, so the fit and finish is perfect. Going to buy another 3 pack as soon as I finish this review (had to comment on the 1 and 2 star users that just don't get it).

  First, I'm really glad about purchasing the Brita water pitcher. It just makes me feel so much safer knowing that my drinking water is somewhat filtered and not directly from the super old pipes that my building is made of. These replacement filters are very easy to install. Hint: Rinse them with water for about 10 seconds before installation and then they slide right in. Also make sure the filter sits at the very bottom.Finally, another pointer I wanted to put out there is that the light on top of the Brita which indicates the quality of the filter is not super accurate and based on average results. So if you're not using it that much (or using it too much) you might want to adjust the replacement periods accordingly.

  Bought a new Brita for someone in our household who's convinced tap water is officially the worst thing ever, even if where I live is *renowned* for its tap water ---- so, needless to say, I wanted to make sure I wasn't spending crazy amounts on the filters when I was happy with my tap water to begin with.I hadn't comparison shopped them before, beyond what was available on Amazon, but felt like the 3 pack was a decent price online... so went for it.Let's just say I went to the supermarket  recently and saw how much a pack of three replacement filters were there.... and got total sticker shock!Needless to say, I'll continue to buy my replacement filters on Amazon.(As for the quality of the filters: they're official Brita, and Brita really does make a difference -- especially if you don't live in a location with tap water as good as mine. But if you have good tap water, then I really don't think it's necessary -- but your mileage will vary!)

  I bought the 3-pack filters elsewhere. However, I found that the new filter style leaked some water down the side of the filter after the install, instead of going through the inside element. After looking at it, I pushed down harder on the replacement filter to seat it correctly. The upper lip of the replacement filter is now just below the lower lip of the housing. That fixed the problem. Now all water exits through the four holes in the filter bottom. The older filters did not require as much elbow grease. Hope this helps those complaining about leaking filters or tap-tasting filtered water. We've enjoyed our Brita for years and I hope it continues to last.

  UPDATE: It's been 7 months since I got this and I'm still thrilled with it. It's gotten a bit faded from the sun beating down on it and I ended up using a staple gun to attach it more securely to the house, but it's still working great. One of the magnets fell out of the bottom, but I can easily sew it back in (non-sewers could probably use super glue).It has taken so much abuse, between the hot midwest sun to the sub-freezing temps and three German Shepherds racing through it multiple times a day. I still highly recommend this for anyone wanting to keep bugs out of their house. It's such a practical alternative to a sliding screen door. I'd like to always have a screen door like this.I will probably replace it with a new one next spring, but I'm so pleased with the quality and ease of use. It's definitely worth it!___________________________I got this because the dogs love spending time outside, but now that it’s warming up, bugs will start trying to get inside. I just got this today, but so far, it’s done exactly what I want - lets the dogs freely go in & out & keeps sealed so bugs can’t get in.It was very simple to install. I just used the tacks & stuck them in a few key places. I started by holding it up to get it aligned & placed the top center tack. It’s a little tough getting the tacks through the edge because it’s reinforced really well, so if you’re doing this method. It’s probably easiest to push the tacks through first. I did the top sides next, then worked down the side to the bottom making sure the center could still close. I got a couple in the bottom sides & it was solid. I was able to push the tacks in a bit, but used a hammer to finish the job. They’re pretty sturdy tacks.We’ve got 3 German Shepherds and they were able to get in & our pretty easily & the screen closed pretty nicely behind them. I walked in & out several times carrying things and it didn’t get tugged too much & sealed after I’d walked through. We may even try replacing our sliding screen with this so we can open & close it.This was exactly what I wanted, it’s working wonderfully so far and I couldn’t be more pleased with it!

  I discovered this product at a friend’s house who has been using this screen for years. My dogs always walk through my screen door and continuously put holes in it, which results in unwanted bugs and birds finding their way in. I bought this as a solution.This was easy to install, it took me less than five minutes. It’s only been a few weeks but I have been very pleased with this product. When my dogs go into my screened in porch, the screen immediately closes after them. My porch will be a more enjoyable place this summer with this screen.

  This hanging screen door is amazing. We wanted to keep flies out, but allow the dog to go in and out so we don't have to get up and open the door for him each time. So it functions as screen and doggie door. Plus it is easy to go through if you are carrying a tray in your hands. It just gently sweeps aside and clicks back into place because of the magnets.We put it up in 10 minutes on our wood door frame using the provided tacks. There is also Velcro in the package in case you have a metal or plastic door frame. We liked it so much we bought another for our sunroom. It may flap open if it is very windy. GREAT PRODUCT!!

  This is awesome! I have a 5 month old puppy and have been potty training her, which involves constantly opening and closing the screen door to let her out. With this magnetic screen she can let herself out and it’s been wonderful. It was a breeze to install too - went up in about 15 minutes. I have a metal door frame so I used the Velcro strips and it was super easy. Great product and perfect for dogs!

  I had a As-Seen-On-Tv version of one of these screens a few years ago that was terrible, so I was nervous about purchasing this one, and debated about it for a few weeks. Wish I had ordered it right away. It's nothing like the crappy version I bought the first time. Screen is way stronger and the magnets are awesome. They are strong and go all the way down the entire middle from top to bottom. We are supposed to be getting a new storm door with a full screen put in in a few weeks and I almost don't even want it now because my dogs love being able to just push their way in and out of this screen door whenever they want, and I love not having to get up and down to let out 4 dogs everytime they want to do some sunbathing (all at different times of course). Only took a day for all 4 dogs (2 of which are only 6 mths and 2 that are 5 yrs) to figure out how to push in and out of this screen. It's easy for them to push through, yet strong enough to stay closed, and close up right after they go through it. My husband was even more skeptical than I was (mumbled something about ""wasting money"" when he first saw it) and he even admitted that this was a really great purchase that exceeded expectations. The only thing I can maybe say in the negative is the bottom tacks on each side kept coming out from the dogs pushing in and out all the time so I just put 2 longer wide head nails in those bottom corners to hold better. Not really a design flaw, I just have 2 not so gentle 60 pound pups.

Hold off buying until Microsoft stops Android emulators from Blue Screen of Death on your PC and Amazon allows fire tablets to view images but both phones and Fire tablets too small to really see what happened.  If both reverse course, glitches fixed, customer svs added, could be great,  but not now.  Dozens of videos of frail, unreliable  Chromecast, other ways to see images on pcs but none really functional, reliable.

It's a long on the tooth, past it's day,  replace it with a Wyze Z3 now device.  Ring is still  OK  IF it turns on and captures what happened.  Ok if all you want to do is record people who come close to your door.  The downside of Ring is that all the porch pirates know Ring sends a low quality image and then  locks the users out for 3-8 minutes, which give the Porch Pirates 3 to 8 minutes safe escape. Porch pirate know Wyze and Nest respond fast and offer no escape window.  Police Dept has warned against Ring. I'm leaving the Ring in just as real time only camera backup because little resale value, not worth removing.

  This camera is a huge improvement over the V2.  Aside from the wider angle of view (more camera coverage), the night vision is insanely great in color.  The fact that this can be used outdoors and can endure the elements makes it perfect.

  Good camera and the image quality is superior. However, one major issue is that the audio is having static noise. Google it and found large group of people is reporting this and the static noise can be hear next to the camera. So the noice is coming from the hardware and can’t be fixed by firmware. Hopefully they fix it from the source.

  The image quality is superb. The motion can be separated to detect normal motion or persons which is extremely helpful to minimize false positives. It is tiny, lightweight, easy to install and cheap.The only con so far is a somewhat diminished WiFi range compared to my previous v2 cam; not a whole bunch. However, the fact that this one is weather resistant compensates in my book.Pleased with my camera. Thumbs up for sure.

  Like a previous user, I also used a TDS (total dissolved solids) tester on my tap water in Southern California vs. this filter.  I've attached a photo of the results.  In summary, what am I paying for?  My tap water actually scored better than this filter.  This is a total waste of money and a fraud.  I'm seriously considering submitting this photo to our local news for their ""Fraudulent Products"" reporting segments.  I have a one year old who was drinking formula that was mixed with the water from this filter.  They gave him ""Marginally Acceptable"" water just so they can make a profit!

  I very reluctantly ordered this because our semi-new fridge prompted that we needed to replace the filter.  When we bought the fridge, and learned it had a water filter, I thought that's nice, but had no idea that MayTag itself would not supply filters for their own products.  Instead, we're forced to search and research for someone that does sell replacement filters.  What we've learned is that this is a captured market and the manufacturers are gouging customers.  After you've spent a couple thousand on a new fridge that uses a water filter, you'll now need to spend $45+ every few months for filters, forever.  Anyhow, the morning after installing this overpriced junk, I opened the fridge and water just poured out everywhere.  It causes so much back pressure the connector and seals cannot handle it and the front shield that covers the filter fills up with water in a few minutes and then continues to flow and spill, continuously.  Lesson learned.  If you can find them, there are $18 versions of this filter that float around Amazon ever so often and they work perfectly.  A more sensibly priced and working version is at ""Compatible with Filter 2 Refrigerator Water Filter W10413645A W10413645 Kenmore 9082 (1-Pack)Sold by: apluschoice""

  I am writing a review on the listing, not the product.  Had there been a single picture of the filter tip, I would have known this was the wrong filter.  The fact that I entered the information for the filter specifications I needed and this filter came up is a problem in itself.  Secondly, I looked at the pictures in attempt to double check that this was the right filter, and not one photo was of the filter out of the package.  We do not need to see 4 images of the packaging, we need to see the filter.

  These filters are a complete waste of money for what you get. First of all, they are almost $50 and in our house we are lucky if they last 3 months. After changing the filter you have to run like 8-10 gallons through it to get the cloudiness out and by then your filter is down to almost 90% if you go by what the fridge tells you.These filters also barely filter anything, does nothing for things like chlorine taste, etc.  Really displeased with this product and if I had know about this issue I would not have purchased my Whirlpool refridgerator.

  I used a TDS (total dissolved solids) tester on my tap water in Southern California the results were 442 ppm (parts per million)When I tested my refrigerator water using this new filter the results was 310. This is marginally acceptable for a water filter and to me a total rip off for this expensive filter. My reverse osmosis filter results are 57. 57 is good enough water for me to drink but not 310 when the filter is new and only getting worse over time

  These seem to wear out really quick, and are pricey. Unfortunately that's the only thing that works for our refrigerator. Also, to get them started you are supposed to run some ridiculous amount of water through them to clean them (like 3-5 gallons). We usually go like 1/2 a gallon and just use it. It uses up like 7% of the filter just doing that initial part. Honestly, we just keep using it after it says it's done because the water tastes fine for a while. So, I guess they don't wear out as quick as they say they do...either that or we are just super cheap LOL.

  This ""FILTER2"" style filter performs well, giving excellent water quality at the dispenser and in ice cubes. The first few quarts dispensed by the in-door dispenser at first appeared cloudy, but when allowed to stand, quickly cleared since the cloudiness is actually very fine air bubbles.Flow decreases gradually as the fiilter loads with use as is expected of any filter doing its job. Our water in Palm Bay, FL has possibly lower particulates than average, so I was able to 'reset' the automatic reminder on our fridge (by removing and immediately reinstalling the same filter) several times before replacing the filter with a new one when flow decreased roughly by 50%.The filter itself consists of a thin cloth-like outer membrane surrounding an activated compressed powdered charcoal core. (See uploaded photos.) This might be compared to a 'finishing' filter in an RO system. If your fridge is connected to a reverse-osmosis system with such a filter, you might be able to skip replacement of this filter and only change the RO filters as needed.)I'm not sure why this filter is so expensive except that it's form-factor is quite specific to this model refrigerator and would be difficult to bypass or replace without considerable effort. Hence the 3 stars. This seems to be Whirlpool's attempt to tap into the 'subscription model' of continuous revenue after the sale for the life of the fridge. <mutter, grumble, grumble> :)

  Take the bad reviews with a grain of salt. It says on the label (in very small print) that you must FLUSH the filter with FOUR GALLONS OF WATER before use.The first gallon I flushed through was AWFUL. The water was gray and had lots of stuff floating in it. After the fourth gallon, it was running clean and clear, and the water tastes great.

  I have purchased many (and I mean many) magnetic screen doors all of which I have been disappointed with. I have several large dogs (100 ponds plus) and they are in and out all the time and none of the screen doors lasted even a month without something going wrong with it. So I was very surprised at this product right out of the box it look better and heavier duty than the previous screens I had purchased before. My dogs have not made any impact on this screen so far. Everything from the magnetics to the Velcro has held up with no wear at all. Screen is as good as when I pulled it out of the box. All the others that I have had would have the magnetics gone or screen tore by now. The magnetics are sewed into the screen (always had a problem with the others breaking off), the Velcro is also sewed in and not held by glue or tape. I also like that the Velcro is continuous not like some of the others I had that were only strips. I also like that the screen is one piece and not two which made it easier to install properly. The over all quality is great and would certainly recommend this product. In fact I was so pleased with how this screen is holding up that I purchased a second one. Great value for the money.Update: over 7 months now and the screen has held up. No issues at all. Love it!

  My wife has always bought the $10 specials of a similar magnetic mesh screen door that last about a month before they start to fall apart. I studied the Amazon ratings and prices and ordered this one. The package is 10 times as large and 3 times as thick as the $10 ones and the mesh fabric is much thicker and durable, along with full and not partial frame velcro. It has bigger and stronger magnets and a stay open feature. The similarity is like comparing a Mack Truck to a Tacoma.

  I cannot tell you if this works well. I had not measured my door correctly so when this arrived it did not fit.you must measure the outside of the door jamb that will accept the velcro.also, you must be able to put the velcro around the ENTIRE door jamb. on mine I have a transom immediately above the door jamb so the velcro cannot be adhered above the door.if your door does not fit exactly, there are no simple modifications you can make. well, you could but then you would end up doing as much work as if you made this yourself.i would return it but after the cost of paying for return shipping it isn't worth it. i am going to see if a neighbor want it instead. let my mistake save you some $$ and measure, measure, measure!i will add that the magnets seem strong. i wonder if my dog would tear the velcro off the door before opening up the magnet?

  It’s great for letting my kids and pets out easily. I don’t have to think about the screen door being left open anymore. Our 100lb dog runs through it daily. It’s still holding up after several months with no signs of wear. It seems like good quality durable fabric and it’s working for our family much better than a screen door. The magnets click together fast after going out and it keeps bugs out too.

  The concept of using this product, depends on what you're using it for. the first thing is it says it fits all types and styles of doors. This is incorrect, depending on the molding and just about any other design from a stock door will have a problem. I have a aluminum door that has a wood frame basically making it impossible for this to attach on the inside of the frame it's not designed it that way. So first off it will not fit all types of doors and styles. Secondly nowhere on the description does is say you will have to remove your existing screen door to use this. it's a design flaw that they do not make clear in their description. Being I have not used one of these before I thought I could simply place it on the door and be able to use the screen door as well. This also will be a problem for anyone that has heavy storm doors as it will not be able to be attached without carrying the thing off the wall. So not only is it a huge design flaw because they are stating it fits all types and styles of doors, it also requires that you remove your existing screen door to use this. A sliding screen door is even more problematic because you simply cannot work around it at all without removing a huge screen door and having to find a place to store it uses little plastic door hanger door.There is an issue with the to directions as well, it may sound silly but they do not state that you need to place this on the outside of the door. At first I was going to place it on the inside and I realized it could not because the door would move. Then try to place it on the outside and you also won't get there because the sliding screen door is in place which would have to be removed to use this product. As many of the reviews have questioned whether or not this works as a barrier to keep pets out. No it does not and it should be able to either if you're able to walk through it. But that also means you must eliminate any screen door you have because it will not work with this product.The material to attach is subpar, the Velcro material used is inexpensive bulk material that you could find a box store, and will not hold up defeat or constant removal. The dog was therefore to be removed if needed but you'll end up taking it probably write off the wall because the Velcro and the sticky material is only intended for light weight use.This particular Velcro is not designed for this application are using it on. I am sure many will find it falling off the wall after time and usage. The Velcro is simply not strong enough to hold it up against the wall. And the glue itself is not designed for the weighted and pull from opening and closing the magnetic drapes. It may work at first but over time there probably will be a problem unless one was to staple the sides and the top to a wooden frame there is an no way that glue is going to last more than a couple of months at the most.And finally the last thing that is not mentioned in the description. This is a very lightweight polyester that will melt. If you are carrying hot plates or anything out to your barbecue or back and forth you could easily burn this material and damage it. It is so thin that it would not take much heat at all to damage the material. Why the intent is to make it light weight so it functions and opens at the magnet entrance, this lightweight material also makes it subject to damage and problems with heat. Which reads really the point if this screen doors left out in direct sunlight the Velcro used and its adhesion will not stay put. One good hot summer and will most likely stop being adhesive.I had high hopes for this product, it's an amazing price and they boast a very promising experience. However the material is simply to lightweight, and applications do not fit the way they state. Any time someone says it will print anything or do anything I question it. I noticed when I tried to install this in the application we had it would not work. In fact I could think of many people that will have to remove their screen doors to use this particular one. Meaning you will have to either but the door back on after you're needing it or keep it removed and had this hanging outside.It's a good idea in concept, the material needs to be made out of fiberglass material or something a little more durable. Furthermore why it may raise the price to do so they should be using commercial adhesive, and commercial grade Velcro. The step being used is not heavy-duty grade material for constant use. Depending on where you live polyester material like this can degrade in UV light pretty quickly. Again something that is not mentioned.These are why I cannot say this is a must buy.It does not fit all doors as claimed.It has poor adhesive Velcro qualities.May require removing your current screen door to use.Does not state heat or fire resistant, so the assumption is its standard polyester plastic material.Directions to not state whether these should be installed on the outside or inside of the doors.

  The OEM filters are pricey, but to me they're worth every penny. I have looked all around for any other alternative that is rated as highly as these for contaminant reduction and there are none. I cannot find a single filter that replaces UKF8001 that is both NSF/ANSI 42 and NSF/ANSI 53, let alone NSF/ANSI 401 as well! All the cheaper, non-OEM filters that I have seen are NSF 42 only, if certified at all. I don't see the point in wasting money on a cheap filter that may not actually be filtering anything instead of paying up for a filter that filters contaminants like Naproxen and DEET out of the water. Do yourself a favor: if you're actually trying to filter your water, get this filter. I've had 4 now, all worked perfectly.

  I went through 2 of these filters now.  the result SLOW FLOW!!!  i believe i found the cause to the problem.  If you would happen to look at your bypass cap that comes with the fridge and the filter and see the 2 parts that are raised inside the cap.  The cap is raised higher than on the filter which would allow it to push the flow valve in further causing more water to flow.  I believe on the filters it's not pushing the valves in far enough to allow a good water flow.  the plastic mold isn't correct when they created the filters.  The filtering isn't the issue it's the actual plastic mold itself I believe is the issue.  Quite a shame for something that's so pricey.

  The flow rate on this filter (0.8gpm) is so much better than the generic replacement I had bought while trying to save money (0.5gpm,) that it's easily worth the premium price (and this Amazon price is better than I found anywhere else.) I had a store brand filter from T H*ME D**OT in my Maytag french door refrigerator.  You can see in my attached photo the difference in design: This filter, on the right, is larger, and has more holes for the water to flow.  The family complained that it took too long to fill glasses; the Keurig reservoir took FOREVER!  I timed the old one, it took almost exactly 60 seconds to fill a 1 quart jug.  This new Everydrop filter filled the same jug in 32 seconds.

  Tip from refrigerator repairman who replaced a part on my Kitchen-aid KFXS25RYMS0:  Buy a tube of food grade white grease -- bought mine on www.smile.amazon.com -- and whenever you replace your refrigerator filter, apply a tiny amount to gaskets and any places that touch.  This will prevent the part that seats the filter from wearing and losing its seal and leaking.  The smallest tube of this stuff will last two lifetimes.As for the filter itself, it seems quite good but I believe the manufacturer is way too proud of its product.  Almost $100 for water filters?  Hm-m . . .

  The filter was working fine for about a month.  I was able to draw more than a cup of water with solid pressure from the water dispenser.  After about a month the filter is now causing the water dispenser to make a loud noise when drawing water and the pressure is really low and slow.I've been able to narrow the problem down to the filter.  Reinstalling the old filter or using the By Pass Cap gets rid of the loud noise so the problem is with the new filter.  I've bought these before when Amazon was selling the two pack and they worked great, I used them for about a year with no issues (reduced water pressure as the filter approached a year).  I'm not sure what has changed but upon a little research it seems others are having problems with the newer model filters.  They aren't made as well and now cost more than the previous ones, perhaps due to poor quality control since this item is 5 star rated and only a few people are having this problem.I wish there were more consumer options when it came to refrigerator filters.  There are only a handful of manufacturers and the off brand filters don't have as many reviews but I will be giving those a try next since I've had a bad experience with this name brand filter and Amazon's support.I'm no longer able to return the product, however I've used the Amazon ""Get product support"" option and received no reply.

  This filter does cost more, but it fits and works.  I bought a 4 pack on eBay for $65.  Great deal?  Nope.  The filters look identical and are packaged identically to the real product, except for a sticker placed over the made in America printing.  I tried all four and all four wouldn’t seal because they wouldn’t twist on far enough!  They also had unwashed carbon and turned the water black.  I tried to flush the one that slightly leaked, but even after about 3 gallons the water was still black.  I put the old filter back in and everything was fine.  I ordered this ‘real’ OEM one from amazon, installed it with no leaking and it’s just as it should be.  I did get a refund from the eBay merchant, but they didn’t want their filters back.  Dont waste your time with the $16 knockoffs!

You can always buy several of them at once and save even more money.Plus, it’s a quality water filter and I feel that’s worth some peace of mind.Check out my video showing the install process.If my review was useful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.Thank you.

  I remember being completely dumbfounded by my pencil eraser as a kid. Where did the marks go? I looked in the air, I looked under my paper. What's it made of? Does it have to be pink?This carpet cleaner caused the same dumbfounded confusion when ""spray, rub, gone"" actually worked. I've obviously lost some of my childhood curiosity over the years, because I didn't try to figure out how the carpet stain disappeared. Who cares? It's gone! I practically skipped to the next room to try it out. The memory smudge of food, footprints, dog vomit. Gone. It even worked SOMEWHAT on the decade old mystery stain left behind by the previous owners that professional carpet cleaning couldn't remove.How does it work? I don't care.What are the ingredients? Pixie dust and incantation.Where did all the stains go? Away.

  I had a carpet stain from an air purifier that wouldn't budge with my typical store bought, go-to product.  With all the positive reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  I followed the instructions and tested it in an inconspicuous spot for color fastness.  No issue, so I proceeded to spray it on my stain.  It not only lifted the stain, but it also lifted the color of my carpet.  Now I am left with an area that looks much worse than when I started.  And what is up with the NO RETURN policy for this item??  My next step is to contact the company, as it states (on the back of the bottle) that it comes with a 100% money back guarantee.  I contacted the company and they said that they do not sell their product on Amazon.  Therefore, I do not qualify for the 100% money back guarantee.

  The product itself is great.  Removes stains perfectly.One star is for how we received it and for the non response when we reported it.Package came completely soaked. Upon further investigation bottle was sealed with plastic wrap but top was not screwed on completely, allowing for the liquid to seek out. So basically we received an empty bottle of Folex. Doesn’t do us much hood. Will not purchase again.

  So, instead of asking for recommendations, I want to give one.I skimmed an article about amazing cleaning products, and was drawn to this carpet stain remover. Sounded great, especially for the cost. So I got it and tried it on an old doggie pee stain I cannot remove. Well it worked, and it was so fast and easy to use. Spray, rub in with fingers or a scrub brush, wipe up with a dry cloth. Poof - stain is gone! I told my husband, I don't even care if the stain comes back, I'll do that once a week - worth it!STAIN CAME BACK. So a few weeks later, the stain came back, I repeated the process but with more saturation, and more scrubbing. I know it's gross, but I smelled the rag to see if it smelled like dog pee - IT DID. So although I've tried 10 ways to get the stain up, this product actually gets 4 month old, repeatedly cleaned, dog pee stains out of carpets. Just wanted to share because I am in love!!!If the stain comes back, it's needs more spraying, scrubbing, and wiping. That's all.

  WOW! A must have for any home.  My carpet had some mystery stains that other stain remover products could not budge.  I had resigned myself to never having them any better, until I found this product.  It was very easy, spray it on, then put a paper towel on top and it disappears. Seriously!  Included some pictures of before/after results after first use.  There were a couple that I had to go back for a second time, but after having lived with these carpet blemishes for years... I was more than happy.  I even used it on a cushion, you don't have to worry about harmful chemicals. You also get a lot of cleaner for your money, I was surprised at how big the bottle was, and you do not need to use lots when you apply, so this will last a very long time.

  My car is over ten years old and my cloth grey seats are a bit grimey. The driver's seat and arm rest is pretty dirty due to my sweaty thighs and arms after working out (I should buy a seat cover lol).This product was easy to use. Just spray very generously (when you spray and it looks like the stain disappears after spraying, you know you sprayed enough), I rubbed it in with my fingers, a scrub brush, and a mirofiber towel (I found that a dry mirofiber towel worked best) then let it dry!Some parts I'm going to have to go over because it wasn't until later I figured out a good technique, but for first time use I think this product did pretty well, just look at the pictures!!The last picture of the back seat of my car, I wish I had a before (posted is the after). There were a lot of orange looking ring stains back there on the middle seat. I sprayed and rubbed with a towel and let it dry and was surprised to see it look clean the next day!I was surprised because usually with cleaners, the liquid just spreads the dirty stains to a new area and dries still stained, but not with this product!

  It’s a miracle in a bottle. My German Shepherd Mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping — this cleaner lifted the stain and now it’s like the devastation my dog caused never happened! As soon as I saw it lifting the ink, I got back on amazon and bought more bottles. I will never let myself run out of this. I use it in my Bissel carpet cleaner for some crazy good cleaning power. I’ve become that weird lady that goes arounds singing the praises of a cleaning product. No regrets

  I use a small single-strap head lamp very frequently for my craft work as it requires that I see very small pieces and details with as much clarity as I can possibly get, so there are 3 things I must have in a headlamp: It must be comfortable to wear straight on my head without a hat underneath, it must be lightweight as I'm frequently bending  my head over and looking down at my work, and it must be as bright as possible.This head lamp hits all 3 marks.Of the past 4 different 'small single-strap' head lamps I've had, this one is just as light, the strap is very strong and is not likely to ever stretch out and become loose and floppy, and this one is the BRIGHTEST of all of them by far.The light fixture itself is plastic and is not the kind of lamp you'd want if you do nighttime construction work or the like, unless you're really gentle with it. But then again, it's so inexpensive that you can buy half a dozen of these for the price of some of the heavy-duty metal ones.If I lost or damaged both of these somehow - I would immediately buy them again without even needing to look at any others. For light-duty, these are really good and I would definitely recommend them.Also, the seller has been communicating to make sure I like them from the day they shipped. So that's another plus.

  My 3 year old always asks to play with my headlamp so I figured id buy him his own. I didn't expect much out of these for the price, but I was blown away when I put batteries in. These lights are incredibly bright and lightweight. The light offers low, medium, high and strobe for the white LED and turns on with low mode first which I really like. The red LEDs offer ""on"", SOS, and strobe. Build quality seems solid. The band is comfortable and I was able to adjust it small enough for my son as well as myself. The red LEDs are a great extra feature and are very bright as well. I haven't been able to test battery life yet, but I'm sure it's decent.  Will definitely look for more lights from this company.

  I bought these so my wife and I could each use one for our evening walks with the dog. You can see it's very bright and provides more than enough light for us to see and for us to be seen. You can also tilt them downwards so that we don't shine in neighbors windows. They're great!

  Bought these for my kids for camping 3&5yo and they are AMAZING. Super bright and several different light (flashing, red and brightness) levels with adjustable tilting up and down . The kids have already figured it out. I was so impressed (and we are strictly PETZL people- avid hikers, night trail runners etc) that I purchased a second set for us adults. Plan on buying one or two more sets just to have as backup in house and in the car etc. Can't have too many headlamps that's for sure. Even with my kids abusing the headlamps I have yet to have to change the battery and they are still super bright. Would be amazing stocking stuffers or gifts and no one would know you didn't spend a fortune!Tip- If you have kids that will fight over them: I had my daughter use a pink sharpie to color in the white logo on the head band and my son use a blue sharpie. Boom....no more fights they can tell whose is whose!

  I have several higher end flashlights (streamlight, surefire, etc) but just wanted something I could use when walking the dog and ordered these while I was on vacation and they were quickly available from Amazon. The quality is very good and they work perfectly. They are very bright and easy to operate. I also wanted to use while reading in bed and my only wish would be that the ""low"" setting was not as bright (kind of an odd complaint when referring to a flashlight). Anyway, I think they are an exceptional value and recommend them highly. There was no statement as to lumens for each setting but I estimate the high setting to be about 150-200 and the low to still be >50 lumens.

  Purchased this Descaler as our several year old Keurig Single cup coffee brewer no longer brewed a full cup of coffee.  Water flow was very slow and coffee cup only 1/2 filled.  Following the simple directions on the bottle - and using just 1/2 a bottle of Descaler,  the Keurig machine was restored to full performance.  It also brewed a hotter cup of coffee!  Very good product as far as I am concerned.

  BLUF:  BUY A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.Gave the product a second chance.  The wife didn’t think I followed the directions and wanted to see if it was me or the product that failed to clean the coffee maker.  To prove this product is garbage, I bought it again.  She Followed the directions to a T for the second time.  She went through two full bottles and the Ninja coffee maker clean light is still on.Do not recommend!For single cup coffeemakers, use only one capful of CLR. Run through coffee maker as if making coffee. Rinse thoroughly by running two full pots of cold, clean water through a complete cycle. ... *Do not use CLR in espresso machines.I did this and in two cycles the light turned off.  BUY CLR!  You and your bank account will thank me later.

  Easy to use and works great! In the past I'd tried cleaning my Keurig with ACV (horrible if you don't get it all out and it curdles the creamer). I also tried simply flushing with water alone which worked for about two days. This is less expensive than the name brand for four uses, I think it has no smell (someone complained about that in a review...not sure what they're talking about), and my Keurig is brewing faster and actually looks cleaner in the reservoir. The solution is a little soapy in appearance, I followed the instructions, used half a bottle, ran a brew cycle til it said add water (all this involves lots of dumping the cup each time), then I filled the reservoir with water and did it again, then I did just water for a second time for a total of 3 times per the instructions. This is three cycles to empty not just three brews. At the end I dumped the lingering water out and cleaned the reservoir, filled it and the next morning had a great cup of coffee. I personally think anyone who had issues using this either didn't follow directions (as a teacher for nearly a decade I know that's most likely) or are just a troll looking to be a grouch. I use my Keurig 2-3 a day every day.

  I was having issues with the temperature on my Breville Barista Express BES870XL. I was getting very, very cold drinks after brewing. I didn't know what the issue was. I even descaled the unit with a universal descaler from Essential Values - Coffee Machine Descaler & Cleaner and ran a cleaning tablet, but the brewing was still very, very cold. It was making my espresso drinks hard to drink. I was thinking my machine was broken.So this week, I had the courage to try again and put up more money for a different descaler this time. I tried this Descaler and oh, boy did this made a huge difference. My espresso drinks are now very hot and tasty. Boy, am I glad i tried this. Thank you to this Universal Descaler. : ) :) :)

  It's lovely to have a solution to dilute for descaling rather than creating my own as I have in the past.  I would suggest that in the instructions, you add a third and perhaps fourth emptying of the water reservoir.  That unmistakable taste (vinegar-like) remains after the instructions are complete.  Now that I know this, I will ""rinse"" more thoroughly.  Thank you.....Susan Peter

  i had my keurig for 4 years and never knew about ""descaling."" Well within the last week, my keurig would take forever to cycle water and my cups would be half as full. i used this as directed, and its like new again!!! you can get 2 uses out of one bottle but MAKE SURE you cycle enough water through your machine after you use this or your coffee will taste funky and im sure isnt good for you!

  Descaled my Keurig admirably. Takes a while to follow the instructions completely as they require multiple cycles of brewing hot water, sitting, and repeat. But follow them CLOSELY with ALL THE CYCLES or you will make acidic coffee that you will sip and then spit on your freshly descaled coffeemaker....ask me how I know.I hear citric acid is a less expensive alternative, but this stuff works fine for me and is not more than I need. I do this every couple of months because it doesn't seem necessary every month for our household of 2 coffee and tea drinkers.

  This light is very bright if you face the LEDs toward the table. And it gently illuminates the underside of a patio umbrella if the LEDs are faced up and at its highest power. Holds well to a wooden umbrella pole and is very easy to operate the latch that allows you to remove or install the light onto the pole. Batteries last a good long time in this light. Highly recommended.Update: July 23 2017 another customer asked if these would fit his umbrella pole with a diameter of 2.5 inches. I measured it with my calipers and the maximum pole diameter would be an inch and a half.

  Each time you push the on/off button the setting changes - it rotates through 4 settings- OFF, 4 LEDs on, 24 LEDs on or 28 LEDs on. The light is a bright white, which is exactly what I wanted..To attach the device to the umbrella pole, you have to open the device.  There are no written instructions for opening the device and it is not intuitively obvious.  Actually, it was counter intuitive to me.  There is a latch which looks like a sliding button, but it does not slide.  You have to pull it out and that will open the device so it can be attached to the umbrella pole.  It is easy to operate once you know to pull rather than slide.You can leave the device on the pole when you crack down the umbrella.  When I crank the umbrella down, the umbrella ""runner"" pushes the light down the pole.  I have no problem leaving the light on the pole and tying the umbrella canopy down.  When I open the umbrella, I do have to push the light back up the pole.Some reviews said that the light was always on.  The ""on/off"" button on one of the two devices I bought was broken and did not contact at all, so when the batteries were installed, the lights were on.  Removing 1 battery turned the light off.  I contacted the Seller and they are sending a replacement for the broken device.  The other light worked as designed.The plastic switches may be the weak link in the device.  I noticed many reviews complaining about not being able to turn the lights off and based on my experience presume it may be the button.  The seller was quite willing to replace the faulty device.I expect to buy more of these lights when I buy more umbrellas.  I may even use them elsewhere in the yard - they work even without an umbrella pole!  I will recommend these to friends as well.5/21/2018 Update.  The seller promptly sent the replacement light, but I was unable to try it until tonight.  It works perfectly.  And it is definitely bright enough to read by.

  I like to go out on my patio in the evenings to sip a beverage and smoke a cigar. Most times I take my phone and bluetooth speaker with me as well so I can listen to music.

It adds a nice ambience to my outdoor space and just the right amount of light. Great product.

  I bought two of these lights for our outside umbrellas.  What i like the most is you can turn them so lighting is up or down.  They have 3 settings which is great. They are very bright and most of all for the price they can't be beat!  I have them stored without batteries in them and then when we need them just place the batteries in and put it on the umbrella .  Pretty simple.  They say they are NOT waterproof and from looking at how they are made I would agree.  The only downside that I can see is the clip that holds the 2 halves together.  I would stronglly suggest that you take your time when clipping and unclipping the latch as it is plastic and not sure how strong it is.

  Awesome umbrella light, so glad I ordered this! Opens up, and clips shut around umbrella pole. Spring loaded braces ensure the light stays in place but easily maneuvers higher or lower to adjust needed light. 3 different light settings from low, medium, and high allow you the best options for outdoor entertaining. This was money well spent! Be sure you measure your umbrella pole circumference though, just to be sure this is the right size you need. Aim lights up at bottom of umbrella for less light or ambience, aim them downward onto table for family game night and while eating dinner. This was actually the perfect solution for my patio set up to bring plenty of light.

  Very happy with our light and particularly like the three levels of lighting provided...just add four AA batteries and you are good to go.Note that this unit is NOT waterproof so needs to be removed (takes 5 seconds!) from the umbrella when not in use. We left ours outside and it filled with rainwater. The good news is that we emptied it out and dried everything off and it still works like a charm. Nice product.

  This is a great solution to lighting an umbrella-shrouded table without an extension cord. It is easy to install the batteries and easy to mount to the umbrella pole. I recommend mounting it just under the umbrella's thin metal extension arms unit that moves up and down the pole. That allows the umbrella to close in a normal fasion without having to remove the light.I rated the bright light setting as a nine since moving from medium to bright does not add much extra light. I suggest that you don't let that deter you on buying this item as the light still offers a pleasant, intimate effect.

  I've been trying to kick soda for a while with limited success. For a while flavored carbonated water helped because I never liked tap water. It took me a bit to realize my problem is that tap water wasn't cold enough. I started mixing tap water with ice to get it colder but I have to let it sit first and ice limits the capacity of water. I also noticed after a few ice waters I could see residue inside the glass because either the ice or my tap water isn't clean enough. Moving to this finally solved my issues because I get clean filtered water that's cold enough without adding ice. It's simple to keep filled and it quickly paid for itself through buying less soda and fizzy water. Keeping enough cans of soda and fizzy water was the most difficult part of my grocery shopping. Now if I want to add flavor I use MiO or one of the other simple additives that are still cheaper and easier than buying cases of soda. Giving your body enough water intake is one of the best things you can do for yourself. When you are done buying one gift one to someone you care about.

  This is a good pitcher and fits nicely in the refrigerator.  However, the shape of the handle makes it hard to hold in one hand when filled with water. The handle is curved and the slippery thumb grip makes it difficult to hold level.  Also, the lid doesn't have a gasket to prevent the water from leaking from the upper chamber when it is full.  Therefore, you have to wait until all the water filters down before you can start pouring, which takes a relatively long time.

  This was my first time using these bags and they are the absolute worst! My 11 year old son usually takes out the trash so we are always sure to not overfill the bags. He started telling us that the top of the bags would rip as he was taking the trash out. I thought maybe he was pulling the drawstring too tight until I took the trash out myself one day. The bags would begin ripping from the top every single time. This is a large box and we were already past the return date so we continued to use them and just decided we would never buy these again. Well this past week my husband took the trash out instead of my son and on his way out the entire bag split open from the bottom. There was trash and food everywhere on my CARPETED steps!!! Now I have to get my carpet cleaned! It was very frustrating to have to clean this up. Thank goodness my son wasn't the one taking the trash out this time. I emailed the company to let them know of the poor quality of their product and of course no reply! I'm holding on to the remainder of the bags in case they ever do contact me for more info but I will not use these again. DO NOT BUY!!!

  This is truly a 1-star review, but I gave it 5-stars to alert people to refer to all of the new 1-star reviews after Hefty redesigned the bags.  I've been buying 13 gallon trash bags by Hefty for years.  Suddenly the bags are smaller the old trash bags I bought a few months ago.  They aren't long enough to fold over the lip of my trash can like Hefty's old 13 gallon bags.  Once full of trash, they fall down into the trash can and rip open almost every time I pull it out of the trash can.  This was never a problem before with Hefty's true 13 gallon bags.  Hefty has definitely put profits over quality on the ""new and improved"" revision of this bag.  They made the plastic thinner and reduced the size of the bag significantly while still calling it a 13 gallon bag.  I checked the box and the previous bags were 23.75"" Wide and 27"" Tall.  These ""new and improved"" Hefty 13 gallon bags are only 24-7/8"" tall.  They cut off a few inches hoping no one would notice.  The new bags are 0.9 mil thickness.UPDATE 16/JAN/2021 - I can't wait to be finished with these horrible bags.  Hefty sure tricked me on this purchase.  They are too small for my 13 gallon trash can and they continually rip when I pull them out.  They also fall down inside the trash bin because they are a few inches shorter than the normal 13 gallon bags.  Due to their size, we are using twice as many trash bags as we were before.

  I have used this brand of bags for awhile, but this most recent box I purchased through Amazon is of exceptionally poor quality.  Liquid seeps slowly out of the bottom of the bags, even though they have no visible holes.  I am about halfway through a box of 80ct bags, and have had this issue with nearly all of the bags on this roll.  I recently switched to the second roll from this box, which appears to have the same issue.In addition to the seepage issue, these bags also puncture very easily now - an issue that I don't recall having with previous boxes.  Just in the process of lifting the bag from my trash can, I have punctured several bags with my fingernails, which are trimmed barely beyond the tips of my fingers and are regularly filed and cared for.  I'm hoping that this is reflective of a quality issue they had with a specific run of product, rather than a design or materials change that is causing these issues that should be expected from this point forward in their manufacture line.

  Hefty seems to have decided to replace their old scented arm and hammer bags with these. They don't even compare to the old ones. I've only used 3 of the 80 bags so far and every one of them has gotten multiple holes in them with the slightest touch. 1st bag got two holes just putting it on the trash can. 2nd one i was very careful putting on the can. it got holes when i took it off the can. 3rd one i was careful putting it on and off, but when i went to take the bag outside not only did it get a hole, the built in string broke with very limited effort trying to tie it closed. I've still got 77 of these and i'm looking forward to the day when they're done so i can try a different brand. Hopefully these don't cause any major accidents in the near future before they're all gone. I would not recommend these bags to anyone for any reason.

  These are not 13 gallon.I have a 13 gallon trash can and I've been using 13 gallon trash bags in it for years.These are more like 10 gallon.And they tear when putting around the top of the trash bin.Here's a pic. The white bag is normal. The black bag is these. It's much smaller and tears easily.

  I was looking through reviews before I bought these and almost decided not to purchase then based on some of the reiews.  I wanted black trash bags for my kitchen so that my trash and messes in my trash bag would not be seen.  I have been using another name brand but become frustrated when the ties would constanted break and the bags would tear so I decided to try these Hefty Ultra Strong bags.  I have used Hefty bags before but it has been a few years.  I really can't remember why I stopped using them.  I think I just found some that were cheaper and went with them.  Sometimes cheaper isn't always better in the long run.  So , I am back with Hefty and I am glad I didn't let some of the negative reviews stop me from purchasing these.I have a Rubbermaid Step-On trash can (step on and the lid opens) and they fit around the top of the oval lid great.  I have not had any problem with them slipping off and sliding down in the trash can.  When I take the trash out of the can , I end up stuffing more in the bag and it stretches decently.  I will admit the bags looked a little thinner than I remember the Hefty bags I purchased before being but I haven't had any to tear and they gray drawstings are sturdy enough and haven't broke.I like these bags enough that I am going to to start purchasing them regulary.

  This product works just fine. I have to order it about once every six months or so for our Frigidaire French door refrigerator. My only complaint is the high price of this item. Amazon used to offer an off-brand alternative, but it disappeared after I ordered it the first time. I wish I had stocked up when I had the chance. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with this product other than the fact that our fridge makes us slaves to having to spend about $100 a year in water filters.

  Received the filter which was easy to install and fit like a charm. However, after the filter had been changed, the ice maker no longer made ice. Tried everything we could think of as we use ice regularly with no luck. Researched online for similar issues and we believe it is due to a defective filter as others in the similar situation had the same issue.We received an email from the seller regarding feedback on this transaction as well as the satisfaction of the item and asking to reply back if there are any issues or concerns. Replied back regarding the issue mentioned above and did not get a response to resolve the matter.Now I will have to order another one and return this as an unsatisfied customer.

I have been through the Frigidaire original filter plus this filter replacement in 8 months.  On our water district web page says our city water is rated moderate for hardness.  I have had worst.  Either poor quality in Frigidaire's filters or a scam to get more money.  Either way it is irritating.

  This filter is a waste of money, and its way too much money to be replacing every six months or so.  We have hard water where I live and we are always cleaning the lime stains from below where the ""filtered"" water emerges.  It needs to be larger, cheaper and actually do something.

  This is SO easy!  Twist the old one and remove it because all drippy parts are in the cylinder so hold the open end (opposite of the one you're holding) up and then drain it in the sink while you put the new one in and quarter twist and it's done.  Then get a half gallon or gallon pitcher and run out a gallon of water. Then everything's good.

  Though the website stated that this filter would fit my Frigidaire side by side refrigerator, it did not fit.  I checked and double checked the model numbers. Because I did not discover the problem until my refrigerator stated that I needed to REPLACE the filter, by that time it had been six weeks since I ordered the filter.  When I went to return it, I was past the 30 day window, and not eligible for return.  Where is the responsibility for false advertising?!?

  I own three of the GermGuardian Air Purifiers and ordered these filters for years. This new filter with the yellow stripe is totally useless!  I use them on two machines and they do nothing! The air is simply not ""clean"".  The purifier is also very noisy which it was not before.Considering how expensive they are, I feel ripped off. I had them for a while before I needed them, so it's too late to return them. I am not sure if it is the seller or the change in the filter, but they are nothing like they used to be.

  I’ve had this air purifier for over a year and have replaced the filters about once every 2-3 months. However, when I received the filter I ordered a week or two ago, I was surprised that the black carbon layer had been changed. It’s similar to felt. Because of this new change, my air purifier is working OVERTIME. It’s insanely loud, and has to be vacuumed daily (which isn’t very helpful, whereas the original one was easy to clean and significantly decreased the loudness). Vacuuming it daily doesn’t help. The new carbon layer is thick and clogs almost immediately. I’m really disappointed with this product. The original one was great, why fix what isn’t broken? This new filter is really testing the limits of my (very expensive) air purifier.

  I got my Germ Guardian 6 months ago and just recently my red light came in to change the filter. I was looking at the reviews on Amazon and saw that there were mixed reactions. I still purchased because some were positive and the price was better than other places! I’ve tried to touch on some of the concerning reviews I’ve seen and how my experience was similar/different.Packaging: The package appeared to be just as expected.Change in appearance: I saw a review that talked about how the filter Looked different and could be a knock off, but this doesn’t seem to be the case. My filter looked like it was good quality and there was an insert that talked about how the product was just redesigned to be efficient so it may look differentlyInstallation: Installation was super easy and the machine had helpful labels.Frequency: I now know I should have been cleaning the black filter (not the white accordion filter) monthly so I’ll begin doing that. It recommends changing the entire filter every 6 months which is right when the light came on.Red to Green Light: I saw someone post that their light was still blinking - After changing the filter just hold down the UV button for about 5 seconds and it will reset the light.Overall, works great and many of the concerns I had previously from the reviews ended up being manageable! Save money and just purchase from Amazon. You can even set up automatic delivery for 6 months.

  UPDATE 2/24/19:So I've been using the new filters in my germguard and just received the flashing light saying I need to change filters. Really unimpressed with the changes (thinner, doesn't fit snugly), especially since I've been feeling like my allergies are a lot worse since replacing the older filters. For that reason, I've decided to try another brand vs wasting my money on this.Also tried contacting their customer service per the comment they left on this review and received NO response. Just some added food for thought if you wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt like I did.**************************************************Really disappointed with the new ""upgrade"" to these filters. I have one of the older ones with the black foam border, and then just received a yellow plastic border. The older version fit snugly; the yellow one continually falls out when I try to set it into my GemGuardian. Just replaced today, so I can't speak to how effective it is and whether it's the same in quality as the older version, but we'll see, as I've got the older filter running in my living room, and the yellow/replacement in my bedroom.As an aside: I'm also disappointed because the light on the machine receiving this filter is no longer working, and it's difficult to find the proper replacement for my model AC4825. Double whammy of disappointment with my GermGuardian right now :(

  I bought this product about 2 months ago and just now tried to change the filter on my GermGuardian AC4825 22” 3-in-1 air purifier.  The product that came out of the package was not same as the replacement filter I had previously purchased directly from the manufacturer. I was disappointed that it was a knock-off, but I still tried it out. However, it simply did not work. I took off the black carbon filter to see if it would work then, but it still didn't work. There was no noise coming from the air purifier.  Finally, I put the old/dirty filter back into the air purifier, and it started to work again. So basically this product is a waste of your money. Don't buy it. Because this product comes in a box that's identical to the original, you can't tell it's a knock-off until you open it and see that it's not the same quality (it feels really cheap), and there's no instructions on the side (like the original).

  My husband decided to take up snoring as a hobby so earplugs seemed a better solution to smothering him in his sleep. I've been through countless types of the orange faom ones, they just end up hurting my ears and/or falling out so I end up with what looks like a bed full of cheetos. So I decided to try Mack's. I will never go back. these things are amazing. They actually block out the noise of my husband's endless nocturnal pursuit of protecting me from bears by obstructed breathing. They don't hurt my ears and they don't fall out. Finally I can get a good night's sleep.

  These go ON your ears, not in them. I fly internationally nearly every year, usually across the Pacific, and wind up wearing earplugs for up to 13 hours (apart from meals), because the sustained drone of jetliners' engines are not good for your hearing. But your ear canals don't like that. They feature a thin layer of skin over bone and damage easily. That's why doctors say you should never put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear. And I can say from long experience that conventional foam earplugs are irritating during long use like what I describe here. But these silicone earplugs go over your ear canal, using the qualities of silicone to adhere to the ear around the ear canal. That's the theory. And in this case it's also the practice. I lost mine before returning on my last trip and had to make do with the free earplug provided by the airline, and it reminded me of how great these silicone on-the-ear plugs are. If you try them I doubt you'll go back, and they're cheap enough to try. You can dispose of a pair after using it, but I've found you can re-use them quite a bit BTW.

  Best earplugs I have ever used.  They really do work although there is a slight learning curve on how to properly use.... you don't squish them and stick them in your ear like other ear plugs!  Instead they need to cover the outer opening to your ear.  Not too much squishing involved, they should stay nearly round when in use.  Really blocks out even loud snoring sounds

  Love these! I'm a super light sleeper so have to wear earplugs nightly. But after using foam ones regularly for over a year my ears were constantly irritated, sore and throbbing. I have small ears and even the foam plugs made for women and small ears just killed me. Finally, my ENT recommended these. I'll never go back to foam! I've been wearing these every night for seven months now with no pain. I like that they're really easy to wash too, since they're silicone. I do have small ears so I break one plug in half and use 1/2 per ear. This is just the right size for me but there are specific instructions included for use.

  Flatten the earplug, then place it over the ear canal. Then press it into place at 12, 3 6, 9, like the face of a clock. I have used these for years and they work excellent. I read alot of the reviews and people are either inserting them into the ear canal or complaining there to soft. They have to be soft to adhere to the skin in your ear. These work excellent, exspecialy if you have noisy neighbors, like me.

  I have an awful coworker that I can hear eating her carrots, chips, etc THROUGH A CLOSED DOOR while I’m WEARING OVER EAR HEADPHONES. I also have a family living above me that lets their children run from one end of the condo to the other until sometimes 11 at night. You could say I’m sensitive to noise. Well these are super comfy and I have no issues wearing them for long periods. Can’t hear anything when they’re in. Sometimes I sleep in them, and if I put my phone next to my head I can still hear my alarm in he morning since it is so close. Very sound deadening if you get a proper seal. Only con is my hair gets stuck in the silicone.

  It blocks the sound effectively but it leaves a waxy residue in my ears so it feels like my ears are full of earwax.  Also the process of putting them in can hurt. To prevent this, warm the earplugs a bit in your hands before pressing them into place.  Directions are included with the packaging as these are not your standard kind of earplugs.

  My bf snores. Loud. We have wood floors in the bedroom  and the dogs. If the dogs walk around, you hear it. Wonderful in the middle of the night. I have tried every year plug imaginable. I can still hear stuff. I tried these on a whim and oh my God! You cannot hear anything. Nothing. I don't hear the fan, the dogs, or my boyfriend snoring.  I do however hear my alarm because I set it super high. But even then it's low. It's a good thing I'm a light sleeper.  I find them super easy to use. You just soften them up with your fingers- really pliable. I do what they tell you not to do but it works awesome for me.I basically put it in my ear and shove down with my thumb. That's it. It doesn't go into my ear canal and when it's time to be removed you just pull it right out. I don't find a problem with it but others in may. The only  problem I have is I have very long hair and it tends to get caught in the wax. You can just pull it out and slide the waxy pieces off your hair. I remedy most of the problem by wearing my hair up.  Oh, they are reusable, I've used the same pair for a while. When they get gross I throw them out. If you have smaller ears, you can use half of one and that works good too. But be careful -it is smaller in your ear canal. Other than that, I would recommend with more than five stars if I could. Amazing.

  From left to right in photos Slim Fit (purple), Dream Girls (pink), Snore Blockers (green), Original (aqua), Ultra Soft (brown). I have read other reviews stating that macks changed the size of the Ultra Soft recently, so I am posting a photo of the packaging for mine. The Ultra Soft are my favorite (even though they are not an exciting color) because they block noise, compress really well so that they are easy to insert, and don't feel like they are forcibly pushing against my ear canal once they have expanded.  The Originals are a close second (just a bit shorter and slightly more slender than the Ultra Soft), so I will use them as well.  I found that the Slim Fit were somehow hard to get into my ears (in spite of being slim) and didn't block enough noise.  The Dream Girls fit really well but usually didn't stay in all night (and I sometimes  worried they would get shoved down too far to get out). The Snore Blockers truly block the most noise, but they push too hard against my ear canal to be comfortable for long periods.  The Macks brand ear plugs have not caused irritation or itching in my ears (other brands have), but I throw them away after one use so I can't speak to durability.  Wish I could say that I received a discount in my quest for the perfect plug, but I purchased all at full price on Amazon and just decided to write a review comparing them because I had a hard time differentiating based on the product descriptions.

  What happened? These used to be made from angel fat. The squishiest earplug out there. Now, they are as hard as a correction officers eyeballs. These are no different than the other ear plugs. I have plugs from other containers, still, and these are like they’ve been left in a microwave oven too long.  They feel just like everyone else’s plugs.

  UPDATE: I was able to exchange these and got the smaller ones (as shown in the picture from my earlier review), which was great. Just reordered and got the bigger ones again. They have definitely changed their product without saying anything. These are not better. They don't stay in my ears at all, or block any sound. On to new earplugs due to product change...AGAIN.I just requested an exchange because either the package I received is defective or Macks has changed this product. The new container I received has ear plugs that are a slightly different color and that are bigger than the last 2 containers. Concerned because these had been working perfectly and the new ones don't stay in my ears at all and don't block any sound whatsoever. If the new package is the same as what I got most recently, I'll be shopping for new ear plugs again.

  I ordered these a year ago in October 2015 and they were the best earplugs I've ever used. I ran out October 2016 and placed an order for more and the newer earplugs are some of the worst I have used. The good ones (pictured left) are noticeably shorter and fatter and appear to have a smooth glossy finish.  The bad ones (pictured right) are taller and thinner. They are skinny and do not do a good job of creating a seal.  The noise they block out is significantly less than the old design likely due to the bad seal and more porous foam used.Buyer Beware, many of the 5-star reviews are for the old design.  If anyone finds earplugs that are similar to the old design, please let me know!

  As other reviews mentioned, something seems to have changed and not really for the better. While these new ones do feel a little better in my ears, I've found they don't last nearly as long and actually have popped out on me a few times. I use these to sleep, cut the grass, and go to the races. The old version I could use 1 pair at night for almost 2 weeks. These new ones are trash after 2-3 nights tops, and I have to take multiple pairs to the race track with me in order to last the entire day (7a-8p). Will likely be trying a different brand soon and donating these or keeping them in my suitcase for backup on trips.UPDATE: Had to go from 3 stars down to 1. I've tried for a couple months now to make these work and they simply don't. In order to get them to stay in you have to jam them dangerously deep into your ears, hurt like crazy, and even then they don't block out that much sound. If you insert then just a little more shallow so they don't hurt, they pop right out and they barely even muffle noise. There's been times when they were ""in"" and then fell out and I never knew because there was no difference in noise reduction. Whenever they updated this product, they took a MAJOR leap backwards. 2 years ago, the product was perfect. Now I'm throwing most of this container away and ordering from another company.

  My boyfriend snores like a buffalo! We have already started sleeping in separate rooms (we both can actually sleep now, I love it!!). But vacations had turned into something I dread!We just got back from a 10 day southwest vacation, which is why I bought these! I've tried many other ear plugs. They sort of work, but hurt my ears as I'm a side-sleeper.I brought three different plugs to try on this last vaca. Happened to use these Mack's first. Didn't even waste my time on the other two. These are squishy enough to completely plug your ears, and also squishy enough not to hurt your ears. I can sleep with them in all night! I couldn't even hear the alarm clock at all. And I was able to sleep next to a lumberjack (sawing logs, lol) all night!!Just make sure you put them in correctly. Roll between your fingers and make as thin as possible, then stick one in as far as you can and hold. You'll get the feel for it. They really are awesome!!

  i dont understand.  I have been buying these oem filters for years now.  I never purchased directly from AMAZON but this time automatically ordered through the dash button the purchase automatically went to AMAZON and not the vendors I use to purchase from.  Also weird is that there are no other vendors that sell the OEM when I do a search now on Amazon.  You can only find aftermarket ones through other vendors.  The water is cloudy and chalky and its definitely not from air bubbles.  There is a residue and chalk in the cup and this is after a few days and even putting it through a britta filter still cloudy.  The water is CRYSTAL CLEAR when we put a bypass filter.  Did they change manufacturers?  Are these fake? I have NEVER had any issues in the past until now.  I returned the first one and received the second one two days later  and same results  CLOUDY water.  If my memory serves me right the old packaging was purple so these may be new manufacturers or new manufacturing and water that comes out does not taste good nor does it look safe to drink.

  I opened the package and inspected the item. This item was sold as new, but clearly was tampered with. See the photos. The seam of my old filter has a clean line and the number matches up with the guiding rail. The replacement I just received looks like it was cut and glued back together.

  Inserted the filter into my 6 months old Frigidaire, ran water through for 3 minutes as instructed, and waited for the cloudy, gray water to clear up. Still gray and cloudy.  ran it for 3 more minutes...still gray and cloudy. Tasted the water and noticed a slight sour aftertaste. I put my original filter (came with the new Frigidaire 6 months earlier) and the water came out clear and no aftertaste. I don't trust that this supposedly new filter came from Frigidaire or was new! It wasn't sealed and was loose in the flimsy box.  It is in the mail back to Amazon. I'm calling Fridgidaire direct.

  Normally, these filters work fine but I got TWO bad ones in the same order. When I inserted them and went through the purge routine, there were black bits of something that showed up in the initial water stream.  I ran the normal 10-15 pitchers of water to get rid of that ""baking soda"" aftertaste that is present with new filters. Even after the taste was OK, the water remained cloudy - Really unappealing. The photo shows tap water on the left and the ""filtered"" water on the right. Ugh!

  Have now bought 2 of these thru Amazon and both were absolutely horrible.  First one was bad and could barely get any water to flow, ice cubes were woefully small due to this lack of water and what did come out, even after flushing well over a gallon thru it, was milky/cloudy with a slight smell.  Have a whole home water filter and water everywhere else in the house is just fine so know it's not anything to do with the source water to the refrigerator.  Before calling Frigidaire or repair thinking there might be something wrong with the refrigerator itself, I suspected I got a defective one and bought another from Amazon.  To my amazement, the second was just as bad as the first.  So now almost 100.00 in filters simply gone.  So before I called Frigidaire,  I first opted to purchase a well known ""non oem"" filter cartridge and everything works fine so it's not the refrigerator.  I then purchased this same filter from our local home improvement store and surprise, that one works just fine!  Buyer beware!

  I ordered and installed this filter in October 2016. Everything seemed fine upon arrival and installation. Now it is Jan 6, 2017. My water has been starting to taste metallic, almost like a rust flavor in my water. I dumped all the ice thinking it was maybe freezer burnt ice. Still nasty tasting water. So I put in a new water filter, even though it hasn't been 6 months and my fridge was not telling me to change the filter yet. Presto! Good water again. So...this filter did not last for 6 mo. (with average water use) as it is suppose to as recommended by the manufacture.  I will be requesting a refund for my other 4 months of use I did not get from this filter. These things are to expensive to get barely half the use of them.

  My water was fine until I installed this filter. I have flushed gallons and gallons of water through it and the water is still cloudy. Not the full of air kind of cloudy that clears up if you let it sit, but dirty cloudy. Paid top dollar for the name brand filter and it does not work.  Note - if I let it sit to try to clear the water, it does not get clear, but there is a film of a chalky white substance left in the bottom of the glass or container.  By the time I installed it, it was too late to return, but this filter was faulty.  Money down the drain.

   Don’t waste your money and time on this garbage. I bought this filter 2 months ago, the water stream was cloudy and already slower than with previous filter, but over time this filter became slower and slower until this crawl. 2 minutes to fill a cup. Buy the filter directly from frigidaire’s web page instead, it’s cheaper there too when I bought it.I’ve contacted amazon customer support but he told me to bring it to a store and have it examined/fixed and if it’s faulty product then I “might” get my money back, since it’s more than a month ago I’ve purchased this. The whole point of buying things on the internet is to save some time and having to do so many things for a water filter is just silly. This filter wasted so much of our time & patience everyday already and we thought it might get better but got worse. The customer support isn’t helpful, the price is cheaper on frigidaire’s web page, the product is not working and will waste your precious time away, so there really isn’t any point in buying this filter here. It took my wife 15min to fill a 1L water jug every day... we have filmed it too, if this is not a faulty product then what? Made to malfunction?

  I used this for my nails... why? Because glue for the most part is glue. Nail salons and nail companies that sell nails with the glue included or not usually have a weak glue.. why? Because they want you to keep buying (my opinion). I work with my hands and I also NOW refuse to go get my nails done ( especially in Cleveland because they over price). This stuff is amazing!  So amazing.

  This is the only superglue with a container that doesn't glue me to itself or to myself!  I will never buy another Crazy Glue product because even if the product works, it doesn't matter if the containers suck. And by suck I mean the containers rip and the glue dries up only after one use or the container drips glue all over, gluing me to myself. Not my goal.

  Update:  Seriously, it will glue your fingers to objects.  Be very careful where you point the applicator - just had an experience where the piece I was trying to glue on repeatedly stuck firmly to my fingers rather than the object I was gluing it to.I know from experience nail polish remover will get it off.  But actually it'd be nice if it had a little tint to it so I could make sure I hadn't accidentally spread it away from the surface to be adhered.Still five stars. :)*********I don't even bother with other kinds unless I need something with a rubbery consistency like barge cement.  Long story short - this product will firmly glue my fingers together which is actually a good thing, because it means that it sticks to just about anything.  Earlier this week I broke a wing off a heavy iron dragonfly ornament in the yard.  Sure enough, Gorilla glued it back on!  I had to prop it up for a while, and then later I used a little two part epoxy to prop up to spot on the bottom just because of where the break was located but it was amazing to me that a thin liquid glue would do such a good job on heavy iron.  You need very little of the product to make it stick, too.The container is superior as well - glue not dried up and useless after one use.Come to think I'll buy a couple more tubes just to make sure I don't run out!

  The glue does its job and I have had no issue with anything I glued with it, plastic to metal.  I always get gel super glue because it is so much easier to work with.  This was my first time using this brand and I found the consistency more runny than I am used to.  I will keep the bottle around until it is used up since it does work but I will not be purchasing again. The Loctite is a much thiner gel and the way it dispenses out of the bottle keeps you from using too much, I will go back to that glue.

  $5 to put my car back together?  Yes, please!A piece started to fall off my car for God knows what reason, and I just didn't feel like paying several hundred dollars to replace it.  So, I got some of this, cleaned the area inside and out, and glued back on the plastic, foam, and rubber parts of the piece to the car (it's a roughly 1-foot triangular piece beside the window on one of the doors).  I left it for 20 minutes, drove 15 minutes, then left it for almost 20 hours.  I haven't had any trouble with the piece again, and it was ready to fly off in traffic (!).  Unbelievable!  It looks like there was never a problem at all.  So, $5 to save hundreds?  Yes, please!I've since used this to glue wood, plastic, and tempered glass.  Flawless every time!  I also love the tip on this one—very easy to apply and keep from clogging.Do note that if you use excess, you might get a little bit of a cloud effect—I'm not sure what causes that, but it was obviously from excess.  Also, don't glue your fingernail to your finger like I did, haha.  Solving this required some creativity (all's well).  Very effective glue. :)

  This is a great glue.  The gel keeps it from getting everywhere.  Other super glues are very “watery” and run all over the place.  This glue goes down where you put it.  I generally apply it with a tooth pick.  The cap is awesome, with a little metal pin that keeps the nozzle from gluing shut.  Only issue is I don’t know that it contains the same amount of glue as the liquid forms of this glue.  But I won’t use anything but the gel form of this glue from now on.

  When moving the movers nearly destroyed my dresser and broke a ton of the cheaply held together ikea joints! Gorilla glue came to the rescue and I was able to repair the joints and integrity enough to use it properly again.A few weeks later someone decided to clip me while on my motorcycle and because i have a touring shield for snow and rain that covers hands a chunk broke off but again gorilla glue to the rescue! I put a healthy amount on edges plastic held it in place and it glued back good as new.. i then put a line on each side of crack still open to the elements just incase as i thought it would fail. 24hrs later i tried breaking that piece off with my hands and happy with the result rode with it.. This lasted 2 months until my shield was in stock again and never failed even with daily rides of 80mph+ in rain for few days too.

  This is a quality set of lights overall: Packaged well, nice heavy cord, etc. The lights are a bit of a pain to install, in the sense that you must unscrew each bulb, hang the lights and then screw in each bulb. It's time consuming, but it serves the purpose of preventing bulbs from breaking as you are hanging the lights. As I stood on a ladder, having finally gotten the string of lights in the general place I wanted it, I dropped one of the bulbs and it shattered. That's on me. Thankfully the lights ship with one replacement bulb. Oh good, I thought, the manufacturers were thoughtful enough to prepare for this eventuality. I clean up the glass, replace the bulb, and carry on installing the lights. Then I go to plug them in. One light is dead already and another is flickering like it's about to give out. I tried screwing and unscrewing the bulbs, moving bulbs around to see if it was an issue of faulty wiring as opposed to bulbs, and no, it's the bulbs.UPDATE: It's been 2 weeks since I wrote the initial review and I have to drop another star. Two more bulbs seem to have burnt out in less than 10 hrs of total use.UPDATE 2: It's been about a week and a half since the last update. I received a very thoughtful email from the seller expressing regret about my negative experience with this product. They explained that sometimes in the manufacturing or in shipping, microscopic fissures can occur in the bulbs, allowing air to enter and causing them to burn out quickly. It seems I just got unlucky and received a particularly fragile set. They offered to send me replacement bulbs and fuses in order to fix the problem. I have updated my rating to reflect their good customer service. When I receive the bulbs and the situation is completely resolved, I will check in again.

  Looked wonderful. I purchased 2 boxes to decorate for a party I had, and 1 bulb from each box was blown, but since I didn't have time to return I used them with the 2 blown bulbs. The project was a hit, everyone loved the added touch.Update:  I've changed my review from 4 stars to 5.  The vendor reached out to me to see if my lights were received and if there were any issues.  I informed them that 2 bulbs were blown, and they sent 5 replacement bulbs within a week.  I'm very happy with my lights, and very satisfied with the customer services of the vendor.

  I have ordered 4 boxes of these light sets now, the 25ft. I might just get the longer strand at this point. I love love love these lights. I will attach a photo at a later date, but these lights are gorgeous. They arrived, I plugged them in while in the package to make sure they all worked. Then i unscrewed all the bulbs to make it easy to hang. I hung them up all around my balconey using a staple gun. When I finished I screwed the light bulbs all in :) I would highly recommend these lights. They are PINTEREST perfect!

  My wife read that before you hang lights, you take out the bulbs.  We have  hung 3 strings, over our deck and pergola, without any light problems.  All the 1 star reviews have had one or more light bulb blow out.  We have had none, and at this point, we are very happy with our purchase..

  Very nice set of lights for the price.  I bought a number of sets in various lengths to install on our deck and used a staple gun to mount them.  I am very pleased with how easy it was mount them neatly and also with the quality of light:  it's exactly the amount of warmth that we were looking for.  After reading the reviews, I also ordered a set of spare bulbs which came in handy as a few were broken upon arrival.  A year later we've had one bulb burn out, one socket disappear (more on that later), and a few bulbs get broken by people knocking into them.After the first year, one of the sockets simply disappeared.  It turns out that the sockets are not molded, but are clipped into a backing around the cord.  The socket has two prongs that pierce the power cord to power the socket.  I never did find the missing socked, so ordered a donor set to use as for parts.  There are two clips that need to be undone from inside the socket, and then the back comes loose.  You'll need a tiny flat blade screwdriver to remove it and can undo one at a time.  I was able to press the newly freed donor socket back into the original set and it is once again functional!  Way better than having a light out and way better than replacing the entire set.  My recommendation to anyone who has a bad socket is to press it firmly into the backing (against a hard surface), or remove it and check the contacts that should pierce the power cord.Bottom line: Yes these are cheap and yes these are fragile, but overall I'm quite pleased with how well the work, the quality of light they provide, and the fact that they're actually repairable.

  Beautiful lights! It's nice that the lights start right at the beginning of the string so there isn't a bunch of dead space between the plug and when the lights start, so you really are getting a full 25ft of lighted string. The downside to this is that if your plug is low to the ground then your lights also start at the plug, but I was able to just not put in the bulbs for the distance I didn't want lit and it works just fine.I had no issues with any of the bulbs not working but I did follow the instructions and carefully and gently removed all the bulbs before hanging the string and only then did I screw the bulbs back in. Since then, they have been very exposed to the elements for a couple months now with no obvious tarnishing or dimming or problems with lighting up.

  I use a lot of PPE. When I’m at work (Covid units), I’m in full, provided PPE/gear. When I’m in rotations, I’m mostly on my own for PPE, and that’s when I’m most at risk. So I’m picky about quality & coverage. I knew these were priced well above their competitors. At the time there were no reviews. I took the risk because in the photos it looked as though they provided a more snug fit around the face. Filtration is useless for me when I’m directly in a patient’s face and I’ve got gaps around the chin or sides. These do indeed fit snuggly (though not to the point of discomfort) around the face/bridge/chin. So far, the ear loops are comfortable. In terms of actual filtration, they appear to be maybe a slight step up from some of the less-expensive competitors, but I’m not sure a $50+ price difference is warranted. They still seem over-priced.A note about certifications: you will only find NIOSH certification on the N95s, not kN95s. In terms of the other masks on Amazon, FDA certification only means they are registered  and authorized to be sold in the US. It does not have to do with a regulatory quality or standards process they’ve undergone.Remember to keep all of the factors in mind. Masks do work, but the user also plays a role. Filtration is great, but you don’t want a ton of gaps. Avoid touching the filtered part of your mask. Only use the ear loops for on/off. And if you really want to have good technique, hand sanitize before donning/doffing. And don’t overuse a mask. This virus is heartbreaking to witness (truly), is no joke, and doesn’t just affect the elderly.

  Got my pack in the mail today and confirmed the manufacturer first (Chengde Technology Co. KN95, indeed listed in FDA's Appendix A (EUA authorized non-NIOSH approved respirator), which was on the back of the packaging, as well as on a package insert (see photos). I also confirmed the model was marked as GB2626 - 2019 on the packaging and on the masks.Overall, I was impressed by the quality of the masks - they seem higher quality and are more comfortable than others I've bought.However, most importantly, the masks made a good seal on my face with just the ear loops.  Adding on an ""ear protector"" mask strap definitely made an adequate seal around my face, similar to the seal made with the Powecom FFP2 with the headband straps (without the ear loops).

  I bought these masks as my wife and I headed out to San Diego during Thanksgiving week. I didn't want to chance using the thin blue masks for a long flight out to California and then back to the DC area. Comfort is about medium as the ear loops take their toll on your ears. I wish the seal was better as the mask itself will all of a sudden start leaking air from around your nose and cheeks. My wife's glasses were fogging up randomly even after adjusting the nose strip. I honestly did feel safer with the thickness of the mask. The size of the package was perfect for our trip. We had plenty to use on the plane ride there and back and while out and about. Other than the fact you need to relieve the pressure on your ears and adjust the nose strip to reseal the mask back to your face every 15-20 minutes or so, I’d say these masks are pretty good.

  This product falsely claims to have an FDA authorization; however, this mask is not listed on FDA’s site under “Personal Protective Equipment EUAs”. While there’s an image of an acknowledgment letter from FDA/CDRH stating that this request is under review, this is not the same thing as actually being authorized for that use. For that reason I’m giving this mask 1 star because it’s misleading to consumers and brings into question whether the mask is actually as effective as they claim or if it’s just another fake that seems to be prevalent in the protection mask sector right now.

  Google ""Chendge technology and CDC KN95"" the resulting pdf indicates that the filter material is appropriate and effective, but that no manufacturing certification has been supplied and the fit might be ineffective.  If you want to take a chance and try the fit out for yourself and assume that the filter material is consistent (without the certification), then these are probably good masks.  I specifically ordered them because I wanted ones on the CDC approved list and they weren't.

I took the risk because in the photos it looked as though they provided a more snug fit around the face. Filtration is useless for me when I’m directly in a patient’s face and I’ve got gaps around the chin or sides. These do indeed fit snuggly (though not to the point of discomfort) around the face/bridge/chin. So far, the ear loops are comfortable. In terms of actual filtration, they appear to be maybe a slight step up from some of the less-expensive competitors, but I’m not sure a $50+ price difference is warranted. They still seem over-priced.A note about certifications: you will only find NIOSH certification on the N95s, not kN95s. In terms of the other masks on Amazon, FDA certification only means they are registered  and authorized to be sold in the US. It does not have to do with a regulatory quality or standards process they’ve undergone.Remember to keep all of the factors in mind. Masks do work, but the user also plays a role. Filtration is great, but you don’t want a ton of gaps. Avoid touching the filtered part of your mask. Only use the ear loops for on/off. And if you really want to have good technique, hand sanitize before donning/doffing. And don’t overuse a mask. This virus is heartbreaking to witness (truly), is no joke, and doesn’t just affect the elderly.

  I’ve been using these masks, Throughout the pandemic. I like them and as I am a nurse I’m very confident of recommending them. They are comfortable and soft, wear as recommended. I use one per week on average and spray them with alcohol and allow it to dry each time I use them.

  Got my pack in the mail today and confirmed the manufacturer first (Chengde Technology Co. KN95, indeed listed in FDA's Appendix A (EUA authorized non-NIOSH approved respirator), which was on the back of the packaging, as well as on a package insert (see photos). I also confirmed the model was marked as GB2626 - 2019 on the packaging and on the masks.Overall, I was impressed by the quality of the masks - they seem higher quality and are more comfortable than others I've bought.However, most importantly, the masks made a good seal on my face with just the ear loops.  Adding on an ""ear protector"" mask strap definitely made an adequate seal around my face, similar to the seal made with the Powecom FFP2 with the headband straps (without the ear loops).

   These mask are perfect becaaue the other ones I was using sat directly on my lips and made me feel like I was suffocating. Although these ones give me a bird like look they make it so I feel like I can breath. They're also layers which offers extra protection.

  I bought these masks as my wife and I headed out to San Diego during Thanksgiving week. I didn't want to chance using the thin blue masks for a long flight out to California and then back to the DC area. Comfort is about medium as the ear loops take their toll on your ears. I wish the seal was better as the mask itself will all of a sudden start leaking air from around your nose and cheeks. My wife's glasses were fogging up randomly even after adjusting the nose strip. I honestly did feel safer with the thickness of the mask. The size of the package was perfect for our trip. We had plenty to use on the plane ride there and back and while out and about. Other than the fact you need to relieve the pressure on your ears and adjust the nose strip to reseal the mask back to your face every 15-20 minutes or so, I’d say these masks are pretty good.

  Awesome masks, have been using them for a couple of weeks when I go out. I'm still quarantined and only go out when absolutely necessary, since I don't have an immune system due to my medical conditions, but these masks fit my face just fine, and I can breathe well. They come wrapped in packs of 5 in a resealable bag which is great. I can keep them in my car.

  This product falsely claims to have an FDA authorization; however, this mask is not listed on FDA’s site under “Personal Protective Equipment EUAs”. While there’s an image of an acknowledgment letter from FDA/CDRH stating that this request is under review, this is not the same thing as actually being authorized for that use. For that reason I’m giving this mask 1 star because it’s misleading to consumers and brings into question whether the mask is actually as effective as they claim or if it’s just another fake that seems to be prevalent in the protection mask sector right now.

  Google ""Chendge technology and CDC KN95"" the resulting pdf indicates that the filter material is appropriate and effective, but that no manufacturing certification has been supplied and the fit might be ineffective.  If you want to take a chance and try the fit out for yourself and assume that the filter material is consistent (without the certification), then these are probably good masks.  I specifically ordered them because I wanted ones on the CDC approved list and they weren't.

  I needed a flashlight on the farm. Sometimes, I need to go out in the fields at night to check cows and I like to see what I'm getting into. I bought these based on the excellent reviews. When I opened it I was disappointed because they are small and only take 3 AAA batteries. I didn't think they would do the job but they do!!! I can see over a 1000 ft with these and scan all the fields. I spotted a possum over 1000 ft. I would recommend these. I bought a set for all my children and parents.

  I bought two, one did not work. The compony response is pending. I like the one that works.UPDATE - Here is a company that cares about the customer, when they arrived, one didn’t work  I am really happy and impressed with the speed of GearLight’s resolution.  Nathaniel Newman, the customer service manager, sent a personal note to me, along with TWO replacement flashlights AND batteries.  Thanks so much for that, I’m knocked out.  These flashlights are compact, they fit right in your hand, and they widen the beam by extending the front part. It has different modes, including a strobe for self defense.  They are really bright and that beam widens out quite a bit, the specifics are on the site.  I am very happy with these lights and I now have an extra for a stocking stuffer!  Thanks so much for a great product and fantastic customer service.

  bright, sturdy, and kool looking. Only complaints- did not come with rechargeable battery's, which for the record can be purchased and used separately.  Second, its immense power results in battery not lasting as long as my old light., IE it gets ""dull"", or noticeably not as bright. Battery run time for me is average one week, still emits enough light to see for most part, but I like it bright.I also use it everyday for at minimum 5 hours a day, so not really bad. Just thought good to point out. I'm very happy with this light and can see its quality will allow me to have it for years. Next investment is rechargeable battery to cut back on throw away. Tactical and cost effective. Also another great point about this product is on is on- full power. If you turn it off it goes back to bright. Not cycle through all modes unless you have it on and quickly depress the button to change it. My old light id have to cycle it which was VERY annoying

  I first ordered these lights a while ago and was immediately very impressed by their rugged design and EXTREME brightness unlike any other I had seen in their size.  I was a firefighter/EMT for over 19 years and have used many lights, but these are far and away the best I’ve ever used!  However, a few weeks later, I developed a problem with the switch performance and mentioned it in my review.  Without me even asking, GearLight’s Customer Servive promptly shipped me two new replacement lights as well as new switches for the ones I had.  They even sent new batteries as well!  This is way beyond being responsive customer service!!!  You cannot go wrong with these lights and this amazing company!  I have already bought another for a gift to my nephew and intend to give several more during the holidays.  I use mine several times every day.  It’s been quite a while since I wrote this review but now I’d like to add a few important comments.  I use one of my lights for something at least EVERY day and their size/light output ratio makes them so easy to keep in places where they will be handy if needed.  I’ve also had lots of first hand battery usage experience and they are amazingly good on batteries.  Best of all, I’ve found that they are backed by what in my opinion is the most reputable companies out there!  These really ARE THE ONES TO BUY!!!

  So I'm returning to EMS in little more than 2 weeks and got these two sun shine lights.  For now I'm using these lights as spotlights to illuminate my dog when he goes outside at night to do his business so I don't have to go very far into my backyard.  My dog does not like the invasion of his privacy, he thinks he can be sneaky and not have to do his business at night and get away with whining at all hours of the night wanting to go out and play.Well not with these sun grabbers.  So he has learned he's gotta go when I tell him to go.But this brings me to how awesome these will be when I go and try to light up a darkened night at a scene where I'm trying to find a wayward intoxicated victim or patient who doesn't want to be found.  There is no way that this light will allow that person to get away from me helping them out.  They might sign a refusal of care but at least I will get to assess them and provide the best care that insurance can buy.The SOS feature will come in handy when the violent patient decides that they didn't really want my help and knocks my rear end out and I awaken and realize that I need to flick the SOS feature on so my partner can find me in the pitch dark of the shoulder of the roadway.  Hopefully he has called the Air rescue to be able to see my SOS flashlight shining bright in the night and they can rappel down to my location to airlift me to safety.LONG LIVE GEAR LIGHT, Long Live GearLight.

  I have about 6 of the old version of this extension cord/surge protector.The old version had several unbeatable features:--swivel head so you could have the cord angled in the right direction--flat head so you could put furniture against the outlet--long cord so you could use it behind a sofa and still have enough cord to plug things in.The new version is more than twice the width.  It's absolutely huge.  Not really flat at all.The new version has NO swivel head.  It's locked in the down position.  :(The new version is so thick at the head that's it awkward to plug in and almost impossible to plug in without touching the prongs as you push it into the socket which is incredibly dangerous.I thought perhaps I ordered the wrong brand but my old ones all have GE stamped on them, so they just made significant changes to make the product inferior.  :(

  For the first two months, we thought this was fine; the protected light was on, everything stayed in place, life was fine. But then we had a storm and the power turned off and back on fairly quickly, but both our gaming system and sound-bar that had been plugged in are no longer functioning. So much for ""protected."" We wanted this to be so helpful, but it couldn't even last through one storm!

  We bought this because we need that flat, square plug that's pictured with the cord going off of the bottom right corner. Instead, we got a round one with a cord going straight down making it useless because of other cords using the same outlet being the way. Really irritating that what's pictured is not at all what we got but is what's advertised. That photo needs to be changed or they need to figure out who screwed up in the ordering process.

   There is no locking mechanism on the product. “Twist to close” would be accurate but it no way do the covers lock into place. I would consider the covers then just a nuisance since it offers no protection and is so easily moved into undesired positions. Without an actual “twist to lock” feature this becomes an overpriced, annoying surge protector.

  I recently bought a bakers rack to go right outside my tiny kitchen, and by moving my microwave and Keurig to it, I freed up some much needed counter space.  But there's no outlet on that side of the narrow wall it's against, and while I could snake the rather short microwave cord back around to the kitchen outlet, my similarly short cord on the Keurig had nowhere to go.  So I figured another power strip was in order.  I didn't much care about surge protection, but this one caught my eye because the plug is flat, meaning I could plug it in behind the nearby loveseat and not risk crushing it against the wall.  The 10 foot cord was actually a bit more than I needed, and I knew that going in, but it means I was able to place it almost completely out of sight and have some cord length to spare.  It's pretty heavy duty and seems better made than the other power strips I've been using for years in different rooms.  Exactly what I needed, and at a great price.

  I first measured out how long I needed the cord to be so that I wouldn't have extra cord laying around.  Then I use my wire-staple-gun to secure the cord to the wall neatly. And last I use double-sided-sticky-Velcro and I placed it on the back of the power adapter so that it would hold in place on the wall.Came out very clean!

  This might sound funny from a five star review, but it's true.  I'm sorry I bought this.Our carpet is 30+ years old.  We bought our home as a short sale, and there were plenty of upgrades needing to be done, so the carpet was the last thing on my list.  It's pinky-mauve, but if you close your eyes and just let your toes do the evaluating, it's really good carpet.Well, now I know differently.  I've had this carpet professionally cleaned several times - once before we moved in and about every 2 years after.  We've had a rescue dog and a rescue cat and two more rescue dogs - but no more ""messes"" than one would expect.  There are the days we don't get home for lunch, or don't get off work as early as we usually do... nothing major.  I always hand-cleaned any spots, and like I said, we do professional cleaning with well known companies.*gulp*The first night I had this light, I waited till full dark and turned it on.We're getting new flooring as soon as possible.

  I have bought it for detecting the surprises my cat left for me on the carpet. The description says it doesn't work well with cat urine. It worked for me,  so I gonna use it further.  Not sure about batteries life, but if you are not going to use everyday, it should last long.Pros:This UV flashlight is pretty small, solid and lightweight.3 AAA batteries are coming with it and it is ready to use as soon Amazon delivers it to you.You can easily find your pet's urine stains on the carpet even in daylight. (tested, see the pictures)You can check currency if it is not counterfeited or any other UV security marks on documents. (tested, see the picture)Cons:Be careful and don't aim to your eyes or your pet's eyes - this is dangerous. Also don't expose your skin with UV light as it may be harmful.

  I work at a veterinary clinic and perform anesthetic dental cleanings on pets. I use the light after I've scaled their teeth to see if there are any spots that were missed (some mouths are difficult to get in to). I photographed some teeth prior to scaling. Tartar and calculus appears highlighter orange, which my iphone was unable to capture how truly bright the coloring was. This is also great for using in the bathroom or floors/carpets to see what stains your pets may have left. I bleach the spot my cat pukes on, but apparently residue is still there according to the light - thanks light for telling me I need to get a carpet vacuum or something to get these unseen (but now seen) stains out. On a side note, I did enjoy that it came with 3 AAA batteries. I had another UV light purchased off Amazon that was not LED, but it had died after a 1.5-2 year time frame. This LED light if definitely much brighter for what I need it for. I will occasionally look at my own teeth to see if I've missed spots while brushing/flossing since I have braces.

  I am a tenant in an apartment building. I think it is safe to stop there but I won't. I argued with the management that there is no way this place was cleaned. They came in and inspected stating they saw nothing on the bathroom walls looking like pee...I took him in and pointed it out and then showed him everything under the black light. Let's just say I was not the only one with a churning stomach. This revealed streak marks from ceiling to floor where there had been a leak from the upper apartment in addition to the nasty yellow-tinted streaks on my wall.I am going to take this puppy EVERYWHERE for hotel stays and any future apartments.

  I didn’t rate this product on how well it works for deep cleaning because I did not buy it for cleaning purposes. I bought this black light for identifying uranium glass (it lights up or glows when a black light shines on it), and I love it’s size—perfect for keeping in my pocket or purse. The handle is nice, too.Nice clear instructions, love that it came with batteries. Very nice and bright light.

  didn't work to find cat pee. I suppose cat pee doesn't fluoresce as well as other organics, but I thought it would do better than it did. Actually I believe the problem is wavelength. This light is too much in the visible and doesn't have enough true UV to fluoresce the pee.Update: It was pointed out to me that the listing indicates that this flashlight will not work with cat pee so I shouldn't have been surprised when it didn't. I am increasing my review from 2 to 4 stars since the listing is accurate. I do suggest making it more clear in the title that it doesn't work well with cat pee because as it is currently written (""Pets Urine"") I thought it would work with cats. Really besides dogs and cats, what pets produce a pee problem? Changing the title to ""Dog Urine"" would be more clear. Anyways, other than that, it is a good product.

  I have runner rugs on carpet, have tried heavy duty Velcro and other things to keep them from sliding around.  Up until now nothing kept them in place for more than a few hours.  I've had this on there for about a week and it hasn't slipped at all.  It's not the easiest to cut through but it's worth it.  Make sure to lay your sticky side down on your rug or floor before pulling off the paper side.  I threw a few pieces away because it's so sticky, it curled up and stuck to itself.  I thank the reviewer who said it works for rugs on carpet.  May not have tried otherwise.

  I added some pictures of how I did it ( please check them out ) Some people put the tap on the rug bottom first. Because of the size of my project I sprayed my garage floor spot with a little all purpose cleaner, let it dry and they got to sticking the tape down. This is going to be my area rug for playing the bass guitar so I wanted it to stick pretty good. I did a bit of overkill but it’s working out just perfect. Once everything was lined up I put some funk music on and danced around, making sure every spot got stomped on. Nothing is slipping, this tape is the real deal. I easily give it all 5 stars ⭐️ for its ease in installing and working with. Let me know if my review has helped, okay? Thanks and be good to each other. (See pictures) ✌������

  I was excited to receive this. The info said that it was safe to apply to the bottom of a rug and adhere the rug to carpet. So I applied it on Friday and on Saturday I decided to move the rug so I tried to pull it up. The rug came up fine. The tape however did not! I was working hard to get the tape off of my carpet..in my brand new house!! I thought I’d ruined my carpet with this tape. I would NEVER recommend this as a rug to carpet tape! Ever!!I was able to get it all up, but it was VERY difficult! And this was just after one day! I can’t imagine if I’d left it on longer.

  Best double-sided tape ever. I have used quite a few brands over the years with mixed results. This tape has the 2 most important qualities that you need in this type of tape. 1 - It sticks well and stays stuck. 2 - Easy to peel off the vinyl protective with a light slice of a razor knife. Hint: never try to peel protective from the end of the tape. A small slice about an inch in will get it done without blood loss.

  For the price, I suspected that this tape might be not so good, but I didn't really need great. SO, I paid the lower price than a lot of others, but I did NOT get lower quality! I'm amazed at the stickiness of this tape. It's thick and very durable. I used it on the edge of a beaded area rug, and this stuff even stuck to the thin 1/4"" bead on the edge! I also used this on an entry rug that was built for kids and trucks, very rough and grainy, but this stuff sticks to it like . . . well . . . like YYXLIFE TAPE! I would compare the stickiness to ANY other product out there. I have yet tried to remove any, so I can't remark to that.

Hopefully it's just this one because I would like another. *I was able to return it and they sent me a new one, I think I got that before they received the return, new one is perfect.* Things to note: the plug is in the front (at least if you are going to use the remote) I couldn't figure out why the remote wasn't working, I had the plug turned to the back but the remote needs to point at the infrared censor on the plug side.Pros: beautiful, so many options, you can mix 2 colors, you can do just stars, ocean waves, 2 kinds of fades, add music via Bluetooth, dimmable, automatically turns off after 4 hours, it's not just for kids but Parker of all ages who enjoy fun happy lightingCons: plug is in the front, placement doesn't really make sense, be careful when you are walking by, don't want a laser in the eyeDefinitely will make a great gift, get one for yourself too.

   The light moved and projected the waves clearly and isn’t loud at all, you can barely hear when it’s on which is great for falling asleep to! The component is a good size and all the settings / adjustments you can make are perfect and as specified in its description. The music function to Bluetooth works really well too, with a decent sounding system for a machine that’s not specifically made to be a speaker. Overall, it’s a great price for what it can do as a small compact star light projector.

  I ordered this because I was trying to find a night time sky night light that looked like stars / the northern lights.  In the pictures it kind of looks like that, but it really isn't.1. The package comes with a cord that ends in a USB port, but no way to plug it into the wall.  I had to grab my cell phone charger base in order to plug this in.2. There are not 10 colors.  There are 4.  They are trying to count two colors on at the same time as separate colors.  No.3. In the pictures it makes it looks like white starry lights are projected on the ceiling.  They are neon green dots that are in a grid pattern.  It makes a room look more like a techno dance club than a sleepy time bedroom.4. I was under the impression that it made wave sounds.  When it talks about wave speed it's talking about the lights, not a sound.  However you can Bluetooth it to your phone, you just have to keep your phone the entire time to have any sound coming from it.I will most likely keep this to give to one of my kids, but it was not what I was looking for at all.  Not a soothing night time aurora borealis starry sky white noise sleep machine.  It is better suited to a dance club.

  Love this purchase.  I wanted something that could create an ambiance for the home in a corner and this did the trick.  The colors pop and the star feature is so cool.  It does feel like you have the galaxy above you.  I am going to move it to my bedroom at some point and see how it works in there or buy one for the bedroom.The only draw back was the remote.  It wasn’t very easy to work in the beginning but when I figured out the settings and finally kept using it more often due to the keys being hard to push, it worked out just fine.Overall, great purchase for creating that ambiance setting that one would desire for their home.

  Works well for our daughter’s room as her night light but do wish it would stay on all night. Gives a unique look to the room Just be careful of using the red light with the motion, your neighbors may think the room is on fire. Light is bright but has intensity settings (low is still pretty bright). Build quality is average. Rotating motor is starting to make some noise after a month of use. Be aware of placement as remote for TV may change the light settings. Overall we are happy with it for our 3 year old but if I had to replace it I would look for a little better build quality.

  I bought this a year ago to have it on hand when my current PUR filter wore out. The old filter is losing its flow, so I tried to put this one in. It will not snap into place. I pushed very hard on it, and it simply will not snap in. To make sure I was doing it right, I put the old filter back in, and that one snapped right in, no problem. The new white filter looks the same as the old blue filter with some minor differences that were pointed out by other reviewers. It looks like those minor differences are keeping this filter from working properly.I called the Whirlpool help line, and after 15 minutes on hold I finally connected to a customer support agent, who talked me through the installation procedure. It was the same procedure I was already doing, so I was not doing it incorrectly before. The filter would not snap in. He thought that it might be the wrong filter, but I have triple checked everything. I have the correct filter model for my fridge.The service agent thought that there might be something wrong with this filter since I did not buy it from Whirlpool. He told me to order one from them and it will fit. I placed the order, but I have not received it yet, so I cannot report on whether or not a filter from Whirlpool (actually, Every Drop) will fit better than the one sold by Amazon. I will update this if/when I receive the new filter and try it out.BTW, the new filter cannot be returned to Whirlpool for a refund if I open the packaging. Without opening the packaging, I will not be able to tell if the new filter will snap in to place or not. So there really is no return policy.  I am gambling my own 50 bucks on their hunch that the same filter from Whirlpool will fit while this one will not.The bottom line on this is that this filter does not fit in the Maytag MSD2559XEM refrigerator. Caveat.UPDATE:I ordered a filter directly from Whirlpool as recommended by their help line. The cost was $49.99 plus sales tax. I received the filter in about a week.The packaging of both the Whirlpool filter and the Amazon filter are identical, and the part numbers on the packaging, EDR3RXD1, are identical. The filters themselves are NOT identical. When placed side by side, you can see that on the Amazon filter, the body of the filter flares out as it goes into the end cap. On the filter from Whirlpool, the body flares out only a tiny bit, and meets the end cap mostly at a 90 degree angle. Other than that, they look identical. But that small difference seems to be key. The old blue PUR filter also does not flare out where the body goes into the end cap.The first time I tried to put the Whirlpool filter into the fridge, it did not snap in. However, I gave it one more try and replaced the old one to see exactly how much force is needed to get it to snap in. Even with the old filter, I had to give it one last nudge in order to get it to snap in, so I tried that on the Whirlpool filter, and it worked. So, the Whirlpool filter DOES fit, and the Amazon filter DOES NOT fit. I did not try to remove the new filter to see if it will come out. That would be tempting fate a bit too much.The bottom line is that there are at least two versions of this filter out there. One fits and the other does not, even though they carry the same part number. Caveat Emptor when buying third party filters.I ran water through the filter until it stopped spitting air (about two gallons). The water smells and tastes OK. I cannot detect any of the off odors or tastes that other reviewers have reported. The flow is fine. It will take a while to see how long the filter lasts.I am leaving this rating at one star because I am reviewing the filter that I bought from Amazon, not the filter that I bought from Whirlpool. They claim to be the same filter, but they are not. Because of the misrepresentation of the Amazon filter, I would remove my one star and give it a zero if I could. Caveat Emptor.

  The Whirlpool EDR3RXD1 filter did NOT (work) filter water.  I bought filter from Amazon on 2020-04-04.  I install filter on Whirlpool ED5FHEXV502 fridge.  I run 4 gallons of water through filter to set filter into working mode.I set up three glasses of water (see photos). I let glasses of water sit on a table for 1 hour to come to room temperature. Then I used TDS Meter tool to measure the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) of water in PPM (Parts Per Million) units.Glass #1 contains filtered water from the fridge where Whirlpool EDR3RXD1 filter is installed; PPM reading of 255Glass #2 contains purified water from purified bottled water; PPM reading of 4Glass #3 contains un-filterd water from kitchen faucet; PPM reading of 256*** Result: Water from Whirlpool filter have *same reading as kitchen faucet water; meaning Whirlpool filter did *NOT filter the water

  UPDATED WITH CUT APART PICTURES OF EVERY DROP FILTER- still just charcoal in a sock ;)There are many recent poor reviews of this product since the changes made to the filter packaging in winter 2015.  Being a diligent Amazoner I listened and ordered the ""old"" 4396810 blue filter from another source that appeared to have back stock.  Well they sent me the new filters! So I gave it a try.The packaging mentions it is still a PUR licensed filter.  I popped it in, ran out a gallon.  The water was clear and taste like nothing-just how I like my water.I will update as appropriate for longevity.  I found the blue filters to be good for 3-4 months in the summer and 4-5 months in winter ( we drink mush more in the summer)I also opened up the blue filter to see what is so special that people yearned for, it's just a chunk of charcoal with a sock on it.  I'll open up the new white filter when it is spent.

  We purchased this filter from Amazon and followed all installation instructions for priming the filter, but the water tasted worse than before. Had a plastic taste that is not what we had with the previous filter. Not sure if we got a bad filter, but it was unacceptable and we contacted Amazon for a return. (filter manufacture stamp was 01/17)Update 09/23/17:We subsequently purchased a filter directly from the everydrop website as something was wrong with the Amazon filter. Upon installation we noticed a few differences. The amazon filter was difficult to install - the catch for the button would not engage without a lot of force. The everydrop filter installed much more easily. The second difference I noticed only upon opening the new filter. The everydrop filter felt lighter than I remembered the Amazon one feeling (before installation). The last difference was the everydrop filter had much more air to purge out than the Amazon one during the priming process.All the packaging looked the same between the filters without major inspection. I do not know if the filters are used or counterfeit - all I know is something is wrong with them. Purchasing directly from the manufacturer seems a safer bet in my mind.

  Filter had a leak that flooded our kitchen. There was manufacturing defect that was under the adhesive label wrapped around the filter. I saw a drop of water near the front of fridge after I changed the filter. Thought is was just a little that that I missed wiping up after the filter change. I have changed this filter every six months  since the refrigerator was new.Woke up the next morning to a flooded kitchen floor. The adhesive label had held the leak well enough for me to think there was no problem. Sometime during the night it let loose. I called the manufacturer and was told they don't warranty their products sold through 3rd party seller.  Thumbs down to Whirlpool. Now I have to check if everything I buy through Amazon voids the manufacturer warranty. And I get to repair a damaged floor.

  The picture I posted is the authentic product from Samsung website vs. the AMZN product shipped (and displayed).  I first noticed it was very light relative to prior filters I installed and then went to the Samsung website to see pictures of genuine products.  I noticed that the labels were identical except for the capacity section.  The authentic version shows gallons before liters, while what AMZN sent me reflected liters before gallons.I chatted with a Samsung customer service rep who eventually confirmed this was likely counterfeit.  The volume of counterfeit goods is mind-bending.  The health risks of using counterfeit filters is significant.  I thought paying full price would mitigate the risk, but based on the product I received, am going to return the item and buy directly from Samsung pending AMZN resolution.I spoke with AMZN customer service who were very helpful and indicated they would temporarily suspend this item pending an investigation (appropriately so in my view).  Be cautious folks.  Lots of money in counterfeit goods.

  First let me say this review is for the actual product and not Amazon. Their customer service, as usual, has been excellent.We have a 2010 Samsung refrigerator (model: RS263TDPN/XAA) and according to the manual and all on-line resources the replacement water filter is the DA29-00020B (aka the HAF-CIN/EXP).  For all these years we've owned this fridge we've bought our filter from Amazon and have never had an issue with the product.  So what does Samsung do, they go and change the design of the cartridge (ever so slightly) and now it doesn't work.The slightly redesigned filter no-longer works on my particular model fridge.  Let me just clarify one point, the filter does fit into the slot properly however the water DOES NOT FLOW.  I tried a dozen times installing it with and without the water turned off.  Every time the filter would screw in but no water.  Thinking perhaps it was a bad batch from Amazon, I even went to Home Depot and Best Buy and bought one from each of them but the issue was the same.I've spent several hours on the phone with both Samsung support and with J & J International (the company Samsung uses for ALL their parts).  Samsung support says it's not their problem because there is nothing wrong with the fridge itself. Since the issue is with the filter it's J & J's problem.  Well, J & J says they build the cartridges to match the specs given to them by Samsung so it is in fact their problem.  They also denied any changes to the design of the cartridge!  This back-and-forth was so ridiculous it was like something from an SNL skit!For those thinking ""what design changes"", or ""is he nuts, they look the same"" I'm attaching some photos showing the filter i purchased last year and the one from two weeks ago.So basically I'm not sure what to do!  I am still using the filter from last year (which is working like a champ still).  Was thinking about trying a third-party filter but not sure if that's wise.

  I have not used the water dispenser on my Fridge for a while. WHY, you ask. Because Samsung screwed the pooch and changed the design without checking to see how it impacted refrigerators already in homes. I have purchased a number of replacement filters from places like Home Depot and Lowes, and these are supposed to be good but they were not. Turns out the hole at the top of the filter was reduced in size by SAMSUNG causing them to impeded flow and fail to operate properly. The whole on the filter I just received is back to the proper size and now works properly YEAH!!!So I struggled to score this review because I think people with bad experiences will check low scores but I decided to score as things are today. I WANTED TO GIVE SAMSUNG 0 stars for hiding the truth of this situation and for deciding to sell through bad stock rather than recall and replace filters.

  Item received was not the SAME as advertised online on the Amazon!Product code appears to be the same but;1. Package DO NOT have the 'NSF/ANSI 53 Certified' Gold Mark as it appears on online page!2. Filter inside do not list 'Lead/Mercury' as listed online!Filter I received is Made in Mexico.It seems to me that ONLY the HAF-CIN/EXP filter batches made in Korea under 'Genuine Samsung' label carry the NSF/ANSI 53 gold certification, as those batches may have been actually tested and approved. Others just say 'confirmed to' notification.Those are available at local Lowes or Home Depot for ~$50+tax. I was ordering something else from Amazon and thought to add this as it appeared this to be the same but........it seems these are nothing short of those cheap knock offs available from others for around $10-20!If you want to make sure these confirms to NSF/ANSI 53, especially for Lead/Mercury, look for 'gold-certified' label and those genuine Samsung 'Made in Korea'Item is going out the door as a return.....Disappointed!!

  BEWARE!!!  2/10/2018 installed the filter according to directions.  Did turn water off.  Watched a You Tube.  It is not that hard.  After installed and turned water on little to no water was flowing from dispenser.  Worked with it for several hours.  Overnight water leaked on hardwood floor, went thru to lower level.  Immediately turned water off and set up heaters, dehumidifier and fans.  The big box store that we bought the refrigerator from sold the exact same filter 2/11/2018.  Again same results.  No water.  Monday after many conversations with SAMSUNG (customer no service) a ""TECH"" instructed to just remove the $49.00 filter.  YOU DON""T NEED IT!  Just install a filter on the water line.  Removed filter.  NO LEAK.  Water and ice maker are working fine.  The estimated DAMAGE to the hardwood floor is a mere $6,591.53. (SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS AND 53 CENTS)  The insurance company will be collecting the parts and SAMSUNG just might night like that.

  I like the long extendable pickup and overall sucking power. Not a big fan of the counter-top charge base (I would have preferred a wall mount).But after 3.5 years of light-duty use (under five minutes run time each week) my CHV1410L vacuum's battery died. Unfortunately the battery is NOT a user-replaceable item. That's a shame because the vacuum still looks new. And it would be wasteful to toss it in the trash just because Black & Decker didn't design this appliance so we could change the battery pack. For this reason the vacuum only gets 3 stars from me.Fortunately I have many years experience working on electronic equipment. I have rebuilt a few lithium battery packs too. So I decided to replace my vacuum's batteries. This is not a project for the average person, so skip this idea if you are not familiar with lithium battery safety.I disassembled the vacuum by removing six screws. Once inside I found that the battery pack can be removed by unplugging a connector. As luck would have it, the battery pack's plastic case is held together by two plastic tabs that snap apart. Inside the case are four (4) 18650 size lithium batteries and the cell charge protection circuit board.The rebuilding process was straight forward. I used four 18650 high current flat top cells (rated 20A continuous operation). These type of cells are found in some high capacity vaping devices. While soldering the cells it is critical to avoid overheating them. I used a temperature controlled iron, added flux, and worked fast to minimize the heat dwell time. The cells I used are these:

  Same issue as many other 1 star reviews. Some of the units' charger/battery seem to have major issues out of the gate. Mine lasted less than a week. After much arm twisting with the B&D rep, here is their official response after verifying the production date on my model:""We sell millions of these units per year and unfortunately, some did have charger issues.  We have rectified it and sending replacements to customers that had the issue.""Amazon -- you might want to make sure you're not sending out these defective units, and only those that have been ""rectified.""

  I have no idea how many B&D dustbusters we've thrown away in thirty years. My family never learns.Our latest (purchased November 2016) has a failing battery after less than a year and a half of light use. The charger is putting out the prescribed charge. The battery shows 15.3v. Turn it on and the whine gets rapidly lower pitched as it drops to 9 volts in 40 seconds and stops.Why are the reviews good? Is everyone just used to throwaway tools? It's not even like you could pop a new battery in. Junk.As a contractor who puts the date of purchase on every battery, I am here to tell you three to five years of constant use is what I'm getting from the quality batteries I buy. I won't mention brands because I think everyone knows what they are. Our next dustbuster is going to work with the18v lithium batteries I use in drills, impact drivers and circular saws.

  Had a SHARK which lasted almost three years before the battery gave out. Ordered a new Shark mid May and it wouldn't charge at all so it was returned. Bought this Black and Decker model and I charged it fully this AM and the charge lasted all of five minutes with continuous use. Thought perhaps it was completed charged so I tried again. Waited four hours until blue light stopped blinking and tried again. This time I got ten minutes of intermittent use before it completely died again so it's going back.All these companies need to find a new supplier for their lithium batteries especially since the buyer has no option even to replace it on her/his own.I wonder if Amazon reads any of these reviews or ever tests any of these products themselves.So batting zero for two, does anyone have a ""go to "" manufacturer that hasn't disappointed in the last couple of months?

  This is an excellent hand vacuum and I am on our second one.  But the reason I am on my second one is that the battery is not replaceable and dies after less than a year of regular use.  This is a major fault in design (or design on purpose?).  I would recommend another brand if you can find one with a replaceable battery.  There are videos online for how to remove and replace the battery with a suitable battery pack.  But this requires wiring and soldering skills.  It also dangerous if done wrong which could lead to a fire and voids the manufacturer's warranty.

  What I hate most about painting is the clean up. I usually get the sub $1 brushes at the hardware store because after I use them I basically toss them, I don't want to go through the hassle of cleaning them and those cheap brushes are usually ruined after you clean them anyways.So I have no experience with high end brushes, but I found these to be really good for the price. I actually bothered cleaning them a couple of time although for the price it's worth buying a new set for each painting project.They hold their bristles pretty well even after washing. Only had maybe 1 or 2 come loose during washing. Overall nice brushes for the price, especially when compared to the cheapos at the hardware store.

  I purchased these because we just bought a new house and new house means lots of painting! This is our third home we've owned so I have painted a lot over the years and have used a good variety of brushes. For the price, these are phenomenal!!They aren't perfect, a few bristles come out when you are washing and if you are edging out a whole room they tend to get a little goopy by the end. By that I mean, they accumulate paint on them and the paint dries a bit as you're going along so by the end of the room you need to use a little finesse to see that your edge is still clean and straight. Though, that said, you get 5 brushes!! So if you are finding it difficult to get a straight edge because of the brush getting full of paint, just grab a fresh brush.I find cleaning them easy. Whatever the bristles are made from cleans off easily with a small bit of soap and water. Aside from the few bristles coming out I have no real complaints. I have washed them all multiple times already and they are still in great shape. These will definitely suffice to get me through all my house painting and I believe they will hold up long beyond.I would absolutely purchase these again and I would also highly recommend them.

  If you are reading this, you are probably a cheapo too. I bought three sets of cheap paint brush sets off Amazon. Hint: the other two are on either side of this one on the Amazon lineup it compares it to. This one is the best of the lot because it has a decent amount of bristles and they are fine tipped so they don't leave too many brush marks. That being said, for big, critical jobs I go back to the Wooster and Purdy professional brushes, as manufacturing a top notch paint brush is an art. Even then, they don't make brushes like they used to.The problem with the other cheap sets is they skimp on the bristles, which are polyester (basically plastic). This really gets annoying if you are painting over an old wall where there are bare wood in conjunction with several layers of old paint. You will encounter a lot of tiny cracks and pinholes, or you have to slide paint under the edges of an old coat of paint. With high quality brushes, the high bristle count holds paint in reservoir, so if you have to fill in the imperfections, you just press harder on the brush and it milks the paint out to fill the holes, then you just go over it lightly the blend it in. These cheaper brush sets with low bristle count will run out of paint to do this, no matter how hard you press the brush down or bend the bristles. You are forced to dip it back into the can of paint. The more you do this, you lose time, and you have more chances of paint drops falling off the brush on your finish, etc.Another problem with the low brush count is it leaves visible paint strokes, so you have to go back over the area again with another coat of paint. In addition, the low bristle count won't hold paint as well, so you have more problems with paint dripping off the brush after you dip it in the can. Get a really good, high bristle count (preferably hog hair) brush with fine strand tips for feathering the finish so you won't leave brush marks, and you will know what I mean. But if you don't want to drop $35 for a single paint brush, then this cheap brush set will get you by.

  I bought this without reading any of the reviews because I just needed paintbrush cheap and quick, but after I ordered and was waiting for it to be delivered, I figured I may as well look at the reviews and what I saw made me regret buying it. One person said basically that all it did was shed and was was good for nothing but a single use, so imagine my surprise when it came and I was using it, washing it after, waiting for it to he shed and nothing happened. It's a great brush for the price and in general I would say to a certain extent. The only issue I have is that the handle is very light, which makes it feel cheap, but it is, so...

  This painting is far from complete but the background was done completely with the 1"" brush using acrylics (and some of the detail I did with a 1"" flat brush not part of this order), but I also used the 2 1/2"" brush to repaint outside wooden plant shelving with house paint and neither brush shed any bristles and both were easy to clean and bristles remained soft. I'd take a picture of the shelving too but it's 104° outside right now ugh.

  This string is worthless, you will go through it like crazy. I have a normal sized in town yard and used an entire roll on two charges doing the yard once.

  Product received was not Black and Decker.  Since it was to be my first time replacing the spool after initial purchase last year, I thought I'd go with the brand-name replacements.  These do fit in my trimmer, and I've run the trimmer for a few minutes and so far so good.  We'll see.  However, when I see a picture online that is clearly a Black and Decker product, and the first words in the product title are ""Black and Decker""  and there is nothing in the description indicating that it is a generic product intended to be a substitute for the brand-name -- I actually expect to receive a Black and Decker labeled product.  It is not worth my time to return it, but I will not order from this seller again.

  I purchased this item from Tool Supply Direct and I did not receive the item as described/pictured.  Instead I received an item, which I am not sure if it is actual Black and Decker Brand.  It is not in original packaging, the spools are a different color (red instead of black) and the tape that holds the string on the spools is missing.  I have purchased from this listing before and did not have that problem in the past.  I have included a photo so you can see what was received.  Now I have the inconvenience of having to return the item for a refund.

  Worst product I ever bought on Amazon- I can't even do my yard with a whole spool-and they don't work properly-have to open it every time to get the line to come out-  they are definitely not 30 feet long-I have use the same trimmer or type of trimmer for over 10 years and these are defective or fake-9-25-17: just bought the same product at a local store compared them to these that I got on Amazon and they're quite clearly defective put in the new one had no troubles works fine nothing but trouble with the ones from Amazon I do believe they're fakes or defectives don't buy them

  Misrepresentation. Look and pictures and read the description. That is the only time you will see what you expect if you order these. I received three red Made in China spools in clear poly bags. I chose these specifically because they are presented as genuine Black & Decker items. They should be disallowed to continue to be sold as listed.

  I bought this in the past but it does not seem to be the same quality as before. Don't waste your money on this. When I used it wouldn't last for more than 10 seconds and would break off, even when using the lower speeds. Each time the line broke it was inside the trimmer head, so I had to remove the head every time and put it through the hole. Seems defective since it is breaking when it doesn't even strike anything.

  Buyers beware. I ordered the part number for my Frigidaire  WF3CB which is on my current filter in use now. When these arrived I did not physically check the contents of the boxes since the part numbers were the same of what was currently in my Frigidaire. Well when I came time to change the filter out low and behold the ones I purchased were not close to fitting. They are much shorter and have an extra rib on the side. Photos if needed. .

  This is a counterfeit product. The trademark on the Frigidaire and the puresource logo is just a DOT. Not the the encircled R used on any registered product in the US. The canister was also almost weightless compared to the original filter that came with my refrigerator. The packaging had the top ripped off and one of the protective plastic covers for the prongs was broken. I am reporting this to US Customs as well as Amazon. The only reason it has one star in rating is because I could not submit this without choosing a star. I would rate it illegal.

  Quick and simple replacement in my refrigerator. Things to note:1. The instructions say to 'prime' it by running at least 1.5G thru it to clear any items from the water. I found this way too minimal a quantity. I ran at least 3.5G to get rid of what I could very easily see in the water.2. You'll hear some weird noises during that 'prime' time, almost like air or straining. It's ok, it ends.3. Water tastes great. Most simple water filter replacement that I've had yet.

  Initially ordered this product in 2016, and it worked fine. Ordered again it to replace the old filter for regular maintenance. Water was cloudy even after several gallons dispensed. Exchanged for replacement, thinking it might have been a fluke. Water was still cloudy even after several gallons dispensed. Requested another exchange to give the seller the benefit of the doubt, but was charged a restocking fee of $11.96.So instead, I ordered the Frigidaire ULTRAWF Refrigerator Water Filter Sold by: Amazon.com LLC, which supposedly works for most french-door Frigidaire models. It's a little more expensive, but it works great: water runs clearly and seems to have higher throughput.

  While I love the quality of this product, it makes the water taste great, I'm disappointed that it needs to be changed so frequently. We purchased this and received it on July 7th, it is now 9/19 and we are having to replace it again!

  Recently purchased, i don't know how long this unit will last but I thought I could clear up some confusion on these.  Unit has to be purged after installing otherwise you will get this very nasty taste for gallons and gallons of water.  I ran about a half gallon of water through the dispenser, pulled the filter, and shook all the water out in the sink.  Repeated two more times, except dispensed about a quart out before pulling.  Bad taste gone.I found this out by googling service websites, where i found that Frigidaire makes a bypass valve for these filters.  So if you don't really need the filter, just want the water flow, contact Frigidare @ 706-860-4110 and order part # 242294502.  $34, free ship.  You won't find that part number on their website btw, or that telephone number.  Took a bit of searching and listening to mood music for hours while i was on hold ...but worth the wait. ;  )

  Do not buy this product to install hanging lights. We cleaned the roof overhang (made of vinyl) with alcohol, per the instructions, we installed the clips and let them sit before installing the lights (per the instructions), we pushed the clips firmly into place (so much so, I had a bruise on my hand), we put the clips 1 foot apart from each other (instructions say to put the clips no further than 2 feet apart), we then hung up our lights. They looked great... for 1 night. The clips began to fall one by one, so we had to take the lights down. All that work to install these clips and they don't work! Such a terrible product! I would NOT buy this product if you are considering installing hanging lights. We ended up purchasing metal cable and will run two parallel strands of cable to suspend the lights from. Save your money and just skip this product, buy the cable instead. Wish I could get my money and time back, such a waste of money, time, and effort.

  I have bought command strips multiple times in the hardware store, saw them here online and  decided to buy two packages. They were described as clear. The clips actually were clear but unfortunately, the actual strip that holds the clip is white so it defeated the whole purpose of being clear, with the big ugly white strip holding it up.  I would not recommend these and I won’t purchase them again.

  GOODS: The price is very low. They seem to be the same as the 3M plastic. It included 24 adhesive strips.BADS: Nothing so far; the parts I have used are sticking as well as the more expensive hardware store packaging.COMMENTS: By all appearances and simple pull testing these are 3M clips. Yes I can pull them off but they take the same force as the other 3M clips I have.  One note on Command adhesive. They will pull paint off of wood or dry wall if left on for over a year. Also, the adhesive pull tab will often break off before releasing the part if they have been in place for over a year.  That is a 3M issue not a sellers.

  I bought these clips to hang my Christmas lights around my windows (inside). They work extremely well and being clear, they are almost invisible from the outside. I used some smaller clips mainly on the sides of the windows to keep the lights where I want them, but these heavier clips are holding the weight of the lights (mini LEDs). I think they would easily hold heavier lights than I am using. I am happy with their performance and will use them again!

  I used these to hang my string lights on my metal Pergola.  They worked great so far.  They have been up a couple of weeks without incident.  I thought my lights would be on the ground the next day from the heaviness.  But, they are still hanging even in a couple of rain showers.  The command strips are in direct sunlight all day and are continuing to hold.  Will see how long they last, but for right now.  I have no complaints.  Oh, they do report various other materials the command strips would work on, but wood is not one.  I attempted to hang some string lights on my wooden arbor as well, but that didn’t work.  I just had to wrap other smaller lights around and let them hang.

  I purchased these clips to hold up solar patio light strings on my back porch. I saw fairly mixed reviews on this product but they have worked perfectly for me. They've been stuck up on my porch for over a month and have experienced some 90+ degree weather and are all still holding strong. I will say that the clips are under a covered porch so they aren't subjected to direct rain. Also, I made sure to wipe any area I wanted to stick one with rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt. I'm happy with this product.

  NOTHING said about this product is true. It does NOT vacuum debris from the floor, it just gums it up on the pad. It is the absolute WORST floor cleaning system ever designed. The pads are expensive, awkward and completely ineffective. They last for maybe a 2' square cleanup, then need to be replaced. They do NOT absorb messes. They smear the mess (plus the sticky solution) all around, so the mess is now spread all over the floor as a grey, visible film. It's also infuriating that the product is not returnable.

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Tool Daily Foam Cannon with 1/4 Inch Quick Connector, 1 Liter, 5 Pressure Washer Nozzle Tips",$20.49,5,"
  I noticed that most reviews here are just for the power washer nozzles.  As most know, Amazon often mixes product reviews.  I ordered the foam cannon and the nozzles came as a bonus.  BTW, they are the same quality as the nozzles that came with my pressure washer. It' almost seems like they all are the same as if they are made by the same manufacturer. They're high quality.  I see someone mentioned that they wear out. I can't imagine how power washer nozzles can wear out and I've been using the ones that came with my pressure washer for years with absolutely no problems.  Brass and aluminum is not worn out by soapy water or plain water. The only thing I can think of is that person was experiencing a buildup of minerals from hard water.  If that's the case, that's easily cleaned out using LimeAway or any similar product or even just vinegar.Anyway, enough of that.  It's the foam cannon that I ordered this combination for.  I put a few tablespoons of Chemical Guys CWS_110 Honeydew Snow Foam in the jar and filled it about 2/3rds the way with water.  I turned it on and holy smoke!  The thickest foam covered everything I tried it on. It was like icing a cake. Beautiful thick foam!  I immediately thought that this is one tool that I'm going to wonder how I ever got along without in the past.  This is going to be great not just for my truck, SUV and motorcyle, but also for windows, etc.  When testing it, I used it on our big gas grill.  It worked beautifully.Before ordering this, I read many reviews as I always do when buying something. Like the nozzles, I can't figure how the foam cannon didn't work for some people. The only thing I can think of in this case is they used the wrong foaming product or they didn't adjust it right.  When I first turned it on, the blast was very strong and narrow.  It really blasted the foam on in a tight stream but it spread out easily and quickly.  Then a turn of the adjustment and I could get anything from a wide, gentle fan of foam to the concentrated, narrow blast.The way these work is very simple and basic. It just applies the venturi principle. There's very little that can go wrong with the cannon itself.  BTW, you can tell this foam cannon is high-quality when you pick it up.  Other than the jar, it's almost all solid brass.  I doubt if there's any practical difference between this and higher priced foam cannons. In fact, I'd be suprised if they all aren't virtually identical for all practical purposes so why spend more.  The old adage that you get what you pay for is nonsense. If it was true, there would be no reason to shop around and compare prices.  That rusty old adage would mean that you would get a better car if you paid more at one dealership for the same exact car than you paid at another dealership. Nonsense!  An example from last week: I'm changing the transfer case oil in my truck.  Most dealers online charge $49.95 to $59.99 per quart!!!!  I went to the most popular online auto parts store and I got the same exact stuff for $5.35 per quart.  My point is, just because someone else charges more for a foam cannon doesn't mean it's better.  This one is a great value, especially considering I now have a spare set of nozzles for my power washer.Just buy it!

  This foam cannon looks just like the more expensive products.  No instructions but hey, can you put liquid in a bottle and turn a knob?  This thing makes foam, lots of it.  Very impressive.  I wet my vehicle, foam it and use a terrycloth mitt.  Makes for an easy wash.  I usually mix the soap with water, 50/50,  and seems to work better than pure soap.  The included spray tips are a bonus and work as well as OEM.  If I ran over it tomorrow, I would call it a successful run and buy a new one.  But it looks like it will hold up as long as I will.

  Product is exactly as described and seems to be a lot cheaper than some of the name brands. The brass fittings seem to be durable but I will update the review if that proves false. No leaks. Would buy again.NOTE: You will *most likely* need to purchase a Quick Connect M22 to 1/4 Male Coupler Adapter, the quick connect side fits the spray cannon and thew 1/4 Male end seems to be a fairly universal fitment for the pressure washer end.

  For what other foam guns cost, and the rated pressure/GPM, this thing produced a lot of foam.Its not like a bubble bath fluffy amount. But it is a thick coating of foam. After you figure out where to set the 2 knobs, youll be foaming up car boats and whatever else 2 consenting adults wanna foam up. It required less time and car wash soap to do 2 cars than I had been using to do one. The bottle is heavy gauge plastic. But I wouldnt recommend playing catch with it.

  I was very concerned when I first bought this product because it was so cheap. I decided I would take a chance and if it didn't work then I would just return it. Well turns out this product is great! It is very well built and heavy so you know it will last. The suds this cannon makes are perfect as well. There is no reason to pay $40 for the other cannons when this one works just as good. The only thing I recommend is to buy the better soap. Chemical Guys does make the best soap and when I first used this product that is the soap I used. My car is spotless and the whole process only took about 30 minutes from start to finish. Do not waste your money on more expensive cannons!

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Regalo Easy Step 38.5-Inch Extra Wide Walk Thru Baby Gate, White Original version",$39.99,4,"
   Purchased back in September of 2015 to keep our newly adopted pup from our furniture (we weren't sure at the time if she would tear up through our furniture if we left her alone).  The gate did its job just fine.  But then again, we have a 25-lb Chihuahua mix, so we didn't need a massively sturdy gate to keep her at bay.  Now, we did take care of my friend's 40-lb Shepherd mix who had some major issues with thunder.  He would get pretty panicky during a storm and constantly jumped and leaned on the gate.  I'm happy to say that he never toppled the gate over.  He did manage to jump over the gate some how.  Don't know exactly how, me must have used some secret Parkour skills or something to get over it.  So, as far as sturdiness goes, it passes by my standards.As it relates to durability, I see no issues.  Of course, we don't have kids pull on the bars and bang on the gate, so I just may have not seen any of the issues just yet.  If I do, I'll likely update this review.As far as operation goes, I like the old version better.  The old version was probably a tid bit easier to open with one hand.  Now I read a few complaints that this gate requires two hands to open.  That's not true, just look at my video.  It's possible to open with one hand and really isn't that hard.  May take a bit to get used to, but not impossible like some reviews make it seem to be.  The major downside I see in the operation of this gate is that it only opens in one direction.  The old version of the gate opened both ways, which was really convenient.  That said, make sure you have the gate opening in the direction you want.  Don't want to second guess yourself in the middle of installation because its a pain to loosen everything up and flip it around.Setting up the gate wasn't hard, but it wasn't super easy either.  You have got to screw those side bars out pretty far to close the gap between the gate latch and the post.  And the farther it goes, the harder it is to turn, so get ready to put some elbow grease into it.  Once you have the gap small enough so that the gate can lock in place and stay secure, its pretty much guaranteed to be rock solid.  One recommendation:  buy and use the ""Wall Savers for Pressure Gates"" if you can (the pressure mounts puts some massive point pressure on your walls).  If you don't, you could damage your wall.  In my case, my opening was too narrow to fit the wall savers, so I had the pressure mounts pushing directly against the wall.  It didn't damage my wall, but it did peel off the paint.  In an effort to prevent this from happening again, I cut piece off of a Kleenex box and put it between the pressure mount and wall.In conclusion, as my headline says, this gate does its job, at least for me.  As I mentioned earlier, the real major negative on it is that it only opens in one direction.  Now if you have 70lb and over dogs to keep at bay, not sure if it'll be able to handle.  My take is that it should, it would just take some major tightening of the pressure mounts.

  This gate is well made and a good gate. I have only one comment. IF your doorway is 33 1/2"" you will NOT be able to use this gate. Without the extension the gaps on the side are too large, with the extension the bars are 1/2"" too wide to go in the doorway and believe me I tried.  I have an old house and the wood is hard and the bars don't give. And before anyone mentions the gate having give I know that, that was not the problem, I had it pulled in as tight as it would go. The smallest doorway  the gate will fit WITH the 6: extension would be 34"" and you would not be able to use the additional ""cups"" with that width.  Just my two cents worth.

  I see a lot of people complain that it came bent or that the latch doesn't fit to the door. Well if you would take the time to read, you would see that it is meant to be that way. So when you returned it and then had the same issue... Well because its made to be like that. You obviously didn't read. It is bright orange and hangs right by what everyone is claiming to be defective!!! Just read people. Here I posted a photo of what you neglected to read!!!I bought three of these gates and they worked perfect for the space I needed them for. Though if the space was getting to big then it didn't seem as strong. But if trying to gate a smaller space this is great!!! Like I said I bought three and they are wonderful! Just try to use for the smaller allowed setting and it will be great. If you go for the larger end of the settings it make be a but flimsy.But again!!!! The door is supposed to be slanted before installation!!! Read the instructions people!!! I mean for come on how did you miss the bright orange paper that hangs from the gate? It says it is not a defect right there!I will get again if I need for other spaces.The gate when open is a bit narrow but nothing that is a problem for me. But if I could recommend anything I would say make the gate open a bit wider. But someone else posted picture with person trying to walk through so have a look.

  We have a two stories house, and we used to allow our dogs to go upstairs anytime they want. We have carpet upstairs and wood floor down stairs, and sometimes one of our dogs will go upstairs at night when everyone is asleep and have an accident (pee or poo). So we decided to buy a pet gate, so we can stop them from going upstairs at night. At least if they have accident downstairs it's easier to clean up because of the wood floor. The gate works very well, it’s very easy to install and to operate. Only issue I have with it is, when we walk across the gate, the bar (see picture) at the bottom kind of requires extra attention, I almost got myself tripped a few times. And we have two elder people in the house, so that keeps me worried. But other than that, the gate works great.

  For the reviewers who claim this gate is cheap or defective, you are wrong. Take a moment and read the instructions. Out of the box it appear to be ""warped"" as others have referred it it - but it is actually designed that way on purpose...so that you can tighten it and create the proper amount of tension. I had it assembled and working in less than 10 minutes. It is durable, strong and fits my door opening perfectly. I have two five month old golden retrievers who destroyed the two wooden gate we had before I found this one. They can't chew through this gate nor are they able to knock it down through brut force! I am 100% satisfied.

  We have two of these now, and they work great.  They're easy to set up.  They have a slight learning curve on opening them one-handed, but it's not bad.However, on neither of our gates did we choose to use the wall cups.  Oil or moisture has since leeched out of the rubber feet onto our wall, permanently staining them.  We have planning on painting this foyer anyways, but just be aware of this if you're purchasing the product.

  I bought the Original Squatty Potty for my parents about two years ago. I didn't have many chances to try that one out, but it apparently works great for my hemorroid-prone father. Finally went searching for one of my own, and the cheaper cost definitely caught my eye. Once I was sure it was still a Made in the USA Squatty Potty brand, I went for it.I definitely prefer the sleeker design if this Simple. Although it's the same height (7"") as the Original, it fits a bit more streamlined with the toilet.  My size 10 women feet fit just fine, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

  An introductory fact: I suffer from irritable bowel disease, and one of the most common symptoms that occurs in my case is hemorrhoids. Thrombosed, clustered, life-altering hemorrhoids. The kind that require surgeries, a preposterous fiber intake, and weeks of being bedridden because it hurts too much to stand.My most recent flare was awful. I missed an entire week of work, two weeks after being initially hired. I needed to heal, and quick.So of course, I followed my fiber and laxative regimen, applied the proper ointments, took sitz baths thrice daily, and visited my doctor and surgeons. And then, it occurred to me: the Squatty Potty!!!I'd heard tales of its splendor from fellow IBD and IBS sufferers for years, but for some reason, never thought that it could help me. But here I was, a new job at risk, and I knew that it was time to, at the very least, give it a go.I was a fool to wait until now!This little stool has revolutionized my bathroom habits. As somebody who has been heavily restrained by time, who has lost countless hours toiling to no avail on the porcelain throne, this tool has proven invaluable.It is comfortable! My body feels RIGHT when I use this stool to pass my stool. No cramping, no unnecessary pushing, none of my usual struggles.It is effective! I had previously been utilizing a little box as a makeshift Squatty Potty; I don't know exactly what it is about the actual thing in comparison to other stools/ the box I was using, but it is definitely designed precisely for bowel relief. The slant, the height, everything.It is affordable! This small price is nothing in comparison to the money I will likely spend in the future on hemorrhoid treatment. Will it cure my IBD? Of course not, but it DOES make it easier to live with, and that in itself is worth so much to me.My hemorrhoids will likely continue to make their occasional appearances, but this little stool has helped an incredible amount in reducing my suffering from said visitors.If you suffer from such ailments and are on the fence about shelling out for this little tool, let me be your voice of reason:Buy the Squatty Potty. Your rectum will thank you.

  I went from using nothing to a $3 ikea stool to now... a squatty potty! I have no idea how I ever lived without this. So much better and more convenient than an Ikea stool and much better looking aesthetically. If you don't own one of these yet, please do yourself a favor and buy one. It allows your bowels to be positioned correctly and letting you flow much more freely. It's genius! Pair it with a bidet and enjoy your bio break like a king.. or queen.

I was thrilled to see amazon tell me it's been delivered. in my mailbox, my mailbox is really small... they lost it but another 1 came  Amazon was great about sending another 1 out. my other half was concerned he would hit his feet on it but it fits perfectly up against the toilet. i prefer my feet closer together so I'm using it with my feet towards the middle vs the footrest spots.  it works wonderfully. guess who else uses it now? says he more comfortable in that position with his feet up and he is 6' I'm 5'4"" works for us both. must have.

Which has been great I can walk with no back pains and I’m 100 lighter. However, I can no longer use the restroom regularly without pumping myself full of laxatives which longer term isn’t ok. I’ve been consistent with using and no added supplements and it’s been great.

  This is my second squatty potty for my other bathroom. My first squatty potty is still top quality even after 2 or 3 years. This squatty potty is getting 4 stars because it is a slightly different design. Why? The original design is perfect and needs no improvement. The new one is just ever so slightly different though. It even feels different. Both are labeled as squatty potty brand. It still works as intended and I'm still happy with it but I wish it were exactly like the original. Its does feel like thinner plastic but for the most part the design looks the same.

  If your pressure washer completely stopped working, read this!I had bought this pressure washer just over 2 years ago for one job lasting about 4 hours total. At the time, I put the unit away and forgot about it for 2 years until I needed it this summer. When I took it out and fired it up, the pump ran for about 5 seconds then ""died."" I tried for days to get it to work with no luck. I was one week over the 2 year warranty, so I was pretty ticked off I was stuck with this hunk of junk.Then talking with a guy at work he mentioned you're supposed to use a pump protector lubricant after each time you use the pressure washer. I read up on this a bit, and the leftover water in the unit can cause the pumps internal gaskets to seize up. This might be due to the minerals in the water, I don't really know. I was considering buying a different unit, then thought I'd take a shot at using the pump protector liquid on my ""dead"" pressure washer.At Wall Mart I bought ""Powerfit 3oz Power Washer Pump Protector"" in the tools isle. This $5 liquid brought my pump and pressure washer right back to life!! You actually screw the plastic threads on the bottle into the threaded garden hose inlet on the pressure washer. Then just squeeze the bottle a bit. I didn't realize if I was doing it right because I couldn't tell if the liquid was actually going in. About 10 minutes later I connected the hose and the unit worked.Hope this helps some people!Update 5-21-18 - Another easy fix for dead unit :)------------------------------------------------------------------------This week I had an issue with the pump not starting, that the power wash pump protector liquid trick didn't fix. I tried different outlets thinking it was an electrical issue. It turned out to be an electrical issue within the GFCI plug of the power washer unit (likely from me leaving it outside in the rain a few days last year.) With the unit unplugged, take a phillips screwdriver and take the cover off of the unit's GFCI plug. With the cover popped off, if you see lots of moisture that's been trapped in the plug, that will prevent it from running.I bought a replacement plug at my local hardware store. You can find the same replacement plug I used successfully to fix my pressure washer by typing this into the Amazon search bar: ""Leviton 16693 15-Amp, 120-Volt, Grounded, Compact Automatic Reset Right Angle GFCI""It's about a 5 minute job.. Just reconnect the wires to the new GFCI plug (Black wire to gold connector, white to silver) and turn the screws to secure the wires in place. Screw down the ""U"" shaped stress clamps that come with the new plug, they hold the wire in tightly. Then attach the new cover, and you're good to go.Update 7-20-20 - Maintenance on quick connect spray nozzles------------------------------------------------------------------------5 years later my Sun Joe washer is still going strong. After your pressure washer has been around a few seasons, it's possible that the very fine holes in the quick connect spray nozzles will get some corrosion. Any little corrosion can affect the amount of water that can pass through, and I found will often prevent the pump from running and shut the pump off. If your pump turns on and runs with no spray nozzle attached to the wand, but does not work with the nozzle attached that's a clear sign you need to do some maintenance on your nozzles to reopen the holes in the nozzle.What I did was take a bowl and fill it with Vinegar. I just used vinegar because I had it in the house, there may be other good methods to get rid of the corrosion. I soaked all the nozzles in the bowl for about 3 hours. Then I took a sewing needle and poked around the hole to clear out any corrosion. Soaked them for a couple more hours, and then rinsed them off under some hot water. Then I dried them off and sprayed each nozzle with little olive oil cooking spray to help prevent any more corrosion before storing them. There are lots of corrosion inhibitors on the market I just used something I had around. This method worked well as it opened 3 plugged nozzles for me.

Compound this with the fact I'm now stuck with a pressure washer and have heard nothing from Snow Joe LLC.

  Ever since I was a little boy, going back to my first purchase, probably something like a cap gun for a dollar at my local grocery store, I've had experiences; great, good, bad, etc. with products.  In my forty years of purchasing things, I have never been so confused, aggravated, annoyed, and downright flummoxed by a product as I have been with this pressure washer.I purchased, via Amazon, almost two years ago.  I followed the directions on assembly.  I have assembled things before.  I think I am not a moron, and yet, it did not work.  It did not turn on.  So, I read the troubleshooting guide.  When a product has a lengthy troubleshooting guide, walk away.  I tried a new plug, a different extension cord, reset the GFCI, uttered spiritual incantations, and then, miraculously, it turned on!  Then it shut back off.  That was the summer of 2018.  I never used it.  It never worked.Then summer of 2019 dawned.  The world was introduced to Forky.  ""Old Town Road"" topped the charts. And me and Joe decided to square off again.  I was ready to battle, but unfortunately, he wasn't up to the challenge.  Turn on, kick off, never come back on.  At one point in the summer, he did spray for 10 seconds, and by the time I walked over to the house to begin, glorious, he had returned to hibernation.Here we are.  2020.  COVID.  Time to clean the virus off the shingles.  I cleaned the filter.  I bought a new hose. I checked multiple faucets.  Same. Result.  I have given up.  I am reminded of that cap gun I bought when I was five.  Sure, it broke almost immediately, but at least it gave me a little bit of joy.  When I order a pizza and it is wrong, at least I can still eat it.  Joe, you broke my heart.

  Plastic handle doesn't feel like it'll hold against the excessively thick and rigid cup.

  My experience was that this is actually a good plunger.  I was concerned with some of the reviews that said the suction wasn't good.  I'd take that into consideration, but I liked the look of it and the stand it comes with, so I took the chance and thought, it's a plunger, how bad can it be?  I bought it for frequent clogs in an upstairs bathroom.  Used it this morning.  My opinion is that it's very well made and very sturdy.  As I actually used it, I found that at first when pushing down, the rubber cup is so sturdy, that you have to put a little extra strength in pushing the handle down to create the suction.  It worked just fine, the suction was great, it did the job.  The handle is sleek and smooth, so I had to use the end of my palm to get a better grip and push it down hard from the top since the rubber cup is so sturdy.  It would be helpful if the handle had some grooves or something to aid with grip at the top of the handle.  So I like it, I'll keep it, and I'd buy it again for a second bathroom.

  It's nice having both a plunger and a cleaning brush all in one. I haven't had to use the plunger so I don't know how easy it is to use yet. The toilet brush cleaner is nice though. I will say it because it is white and I have pets in my house sometimes it looks dirty because of the fur sticking to it, so it does require a quick wipe down now and then. Other than that though it is a fantastic purchase.

  I purchased this last minute for a camping trip and wasn't expecting much for the price, but overall it surpassed my expectation. The fan only lasted two and a half nights (about 20 hours) on the high setting, but it lasted longer than the description said it would. The light was nice and bright and lit up my whole tent. On the low setting, the fan only created a faint breeze, but on the high setting I could feel the air on my face from 6-7 feet away. Having two hinges made it easy to point the fan and light in separate directions and overall I was happier with it than I thought I'd be.

  I had high hopes for this product and while it works as described, it doesn't have the durability I had hoped for. The led is bright enough to light up a large tent. The light is diffused well and lit up our 8 person tent with ease. The fan provides a decent subtle stream of air and is quiet enough that it won't keep you awake. The end with the fan/led ring is adjustable so you can aim it where you want. The batteries lasted over a week of on/off day and all night use. The light/fan use the same power supply (the batteries) and as a result the light dims a slight amount and the fan slightly slows if you use them at the same time. My reason for 3 stars is the plastic the frame is made of is brittle and weak. We had packed it with our other camping supplies and the plastic end caps came out along some of the plastic chipping. It still functions fine, just wish it was made with more robust materials. If it was produced with higher quality materials this would be a 5 star product for sure. I would still recommend this for those looking for a tent fan/light but would take it easy on it and protect it while in storage.

  I opened the box. I put in new batteries.  The light wont turn on. The fan works... so that's nice when its 28 degrees outside and you just want to go to sleep. Thankfully I live by ""Two is one and one is none"" so my Streamlight Stinger swooped in to save the day. Do not buy, cheaply made, flimsy and will fail you when you need it the most.  A regular lantern or even a regular flash light aimed at the top of the tent is worth the extra money when you NEED to have light.

  The top mask in the photo is the mask I am reviewing, the bottom mask is a standard adult size mask for size comparison. I bought these masks because adult masks are too big on my face, a problem that many of my other female friends have encountered. These masks worked fine. This is a good mask to wear running in and out of stores or for shorter periods of time because the fit is much closer to the nose and mouth than adult size masks. The nose adjustment works, the ear straps are stretchy and comfortable.  Colors are cute and cheery (also have pink, yellow and green).

  These are okay masks for school children - a bit too big for younger kids (longish and so they 'ride up' or 'ride down' on little faces), but are good for grade school kids (7-10 year olds, depending on their face size)? The comfort is fine once the fit is right. The main issue I have is with the packaging - they arrived in a thin cardboard box  WITHOUT ANY plastic covering or bag for the masks in the box - basically just stuffed as is inside the thin, unsealed, folded cardboard box. Given all the hands and places the box passed from production to delivery, I'd think that at a MINIMUM the masks would be packed in some form of covering (a basic plastic bag for the whole stack?) inside the box. I discarded a couple of the top and bottom masks because it felt to me that there was no way they were still clean. And ... I placed the rest inside a disinfected zip bag and tossed the god-knows-where-this-was-box.

  Fit the 4 year old, 7 year old and me (adult, narrow face width). Cute colors made the kids excited to wear them. Each mask has a wire nose strip to fit better to the child’s face. Comfortable ear straps. Mask became a little loose on the 4 year old after they pulled it a few times so we just twisted the ear loop once or twice to tighten it back up. Good value for obey.

  I slipped in the shower the other day, and grabbed my towel bar outside of it as to not die.  Doing so, I ripped the bar off of the wall, including the screws and anchors, so I had 4 small but kind of nasty holes in my wall.  I've never done any sort of drywall repair / spackling / etc, and I figure for under $10 with all I could need, this would do the job.I applied the spackle, smoothed it with the flat end of the tube, and allowed it to dry.  I was able to sand it smooth and then paint over the spackle.  It looks fine now.  I give it a 5 for convenience.  This is more of a multitool for a small repair job, so you'll want to invest more money in proper sanders / putty knives / spackle if you've got many repairs to do.

  I normally don’t write reviews for products, but this one was amazing! I’m in the process of moving out of my apartment in nyc (is there anything worse?) and I needed to fill a few holes I made with wall anchors. I have 0 handy experience but this product was so easy to use. I agree with other reviewers that you definitely should pick up real sandpaper if you want your walls to be flawless but I really only gave it 70% effort and the results were pretty good (my apartment is super old). If you bother to paint over (I didn’t) it’s definitely good as new. A renters dream.

  Very convenient but do not recommend for anything bigger than a nail hole. The texture is difficult to get smooth, if you want to properly patch anything bigger than a nail hole, a tiny one. I do not recommend for wall anchor sized holes and would still recommend a sanding block or sandpaper to get a proper smooth finish to blend to paint.

  Absolutely love this product! Completely repairs dings, damages, and holes to drywall (that a lardlord would charge $100+ for) in one product.Used to fix a large wall ding above my bed that was very unattractive. Spackle easily coated and covered the ding (applied with fingers). Flattened spackled surface with the sharp edge on the bottle.Allowed to dry overnight.Sanded down surface with the smoother disk on the cap... No scrapings or dust spilled at all while sanding, left perfectly smooth surface. Painted over and it's gone!

  I was initially a little concerned at the size of the tube once received but it ended up being more than needed.  I used this to fill in 2 large lag bolt holes from a TV I previously had mounted on the wall and also 4 decent sized holes from a soundbar that was mounted below it.Application was extremely easy.  I waited about 45 minutes and applied a coat of paint.....by the next morning you could not even tell the holes were ever there.  Highly recommended....if you have an entire house with a lot of patching to do I would probably recommend purchasing a couple tubes though.

  If you have just a few areas you need to patch this is for you.  No need to go to the hardware store and buy the other gear you'd need otherwise.  I had just a couple areas I needed to fill in.  The material is of good quality, not runny or dried up.  The sandpaper patch on the cap is a smart idea.  I had to apply two layers for one gouge and just one layer for the second area damaged.Other than being a three in one (well, 4 with the primer mixed in) it's a way for unskilled persons to patch up.  Paint I applied over the damaged area didn't have any issues with the material.

  These are working great so far. I have applied them to a few furniture items as we are laying down new bamboo flooring. We have not had to move the items too much, but this far these do a good job balancing allowing movement while not slipping too easily, and have prevented any scuff marks or other damage on the new floor planks.

  UPDATE 6/20: Been happily using these furniture pads and they eventually got all used up! I like to replace the ones on our dinner chairs frequently and always add to new furniture. Has saved floor from plenty of scratches. I recommend changing them out frequently on high traffic items as they eventually collect dirt and debris and get flattened.They seem to stay put just fine! We've been in our house about a month and a half with these on furniture in every room... so far the adhesive is sticking quite impressively. I'm sure after a certain amount of time it will be time to replace them, but they're holding up great for now. These sizes and shapes were great for our furniture. Some of the smaller circles and shapes I ended up using multiples of on different furniture feet to cover the space, but it isn't noticeable. It's actually preferable for the odd sized furniture.I am realizing I maybe should have gotten ""no slide"" feet for a number of our furniture since these make it rather too easy to move our huge couch or the baby's crib when I'm just leading against them. That is not a down-side for this product, so I'm not docking a star, I'm just throwing it out there. I'd recommend buying these & non-slip feet for whichever items you'd prefer not to move so easily.

  These are a good value. They were easy to stick on and seem to be working. I like that there are two colors and different sizes to fit with different furniture.

  These are listed as being incredibly adhesive, and the reviews, some, say they are the best thing out there for felt chair leg pads. Sadly, I cannot return them at this point. They stick for a very small period of time, then fall off, causing my wood floor to be scratched and scuffed. I have replaced a whole bunch of them after only about 3 or 4 weeks of use, because they are constantly coming undone, for no reason that I can see except they just don't stick. On top of that, the felt seriously compresses to flat in a very short period of time. They are almost useless. I'd like to hope this was just a bad batch, but I'm not going to take the chance on buying them again. Not sure why they would work so well for others though, so maybe it is a bad batch. Nevertheless, what we have doesn't work.

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,Odoland Portable LED Camping Lantern with Ceiling Fan - Hurricane Emergency Survival Kit,$20.84,5,"
  I purchased this last minute for a camping trip and wasn't expecting much for the price, but overall it surpassed my expectation. The fan only lasted two and a half nights (about 20 hours) on the high setting, but it lasted longer than the description said it would. The light was nice and bright and lit up my whole tent. On the low setting, the fan only created a faint breeze, but on the high setting I could feel the air on my face from 6-7 feet away. Having two hinges made it easy to point the fan and light in separate directions and overall I was happier with it than I thought I'd be.

  I went camping this week and I just hate when it's sooooo darn hot in the tent and of course, there's no place to put a fan AND a light.  This one worked perfectly.  It hung by it's built in hook to the top of the tent, the light was just right and the fan was quiet and effective for a 2 person tent.  Happy I bought it.

  I had high hopes for this product and while it works as described, it doesn't have the durability I had hoped for. The led is bright enough to light up a large tent. The light is diffused well and lit up our 8 person tent with ease. The fan provides a decent subtle stream of air and is quiet enough that it won't keep you awake. The end with the fan/led ring is adjustable so you can aim it where you want. The batteries lasted over a week of on/off day and all night use. The light/fan use the same power supply (the batteries) and as a result the light dims a slight amount and the fan slightly slows if you use them at the same time. My reason for 3 stars is the plastic the frame is made of is brittle and weak. We had packed it with our other camping supplies and the plastic end caps came out along some of the plastic chipping. It still functions fine, just wish it was made with more robust materials. If it was produced with higher quality materials this would be a 5 star product for sure. I would still recommend this for those looking for a tent fan/light but would take it easy on it and protect it while in storage.

  I used this camping at the faster horses music festival and it was so nice to have!!! The light is great. Lite up my whole tent. The fan has two settings, low and high. I had it on high every night and it really makes a difference. I have a 3 person tent. It takes 6 D batteries and I used it all night for 4 nights and accidentally had it on the whole 3 hours home in my bag and the batteries are still working. I didn't use the light very long. Love the it just hooks easily. Had it hooked in the top of my tent above me. Love this fan.

  I opened the box. I put in new batteries.  The light wont turn on. The fan works... so that's nice when its 28 degrees outside and you just want to go to sleep. Thankfully I live by ""Two is one and one is none"" so my Streamlight Stinger swooped in to save the day. Do not buy, cheaply made, flimsy and will fail you when you need it the most.  A regular lantern or even a regular flash light aimed at the top of the tent is worth the extra money when you NEED to have light.

   Note: Requires 3 AA batteries.Pros:- Surprisingly lightweight for the size.- Feel solid; not cheap-o China plastic.- Bright: They've packed in some many LEDs it's ridiculous how bright this thing gets.- Versatile: I hang this and also simply put it on the table like regular lantern.- Low-profile: It folds up compact and is black (not an annoyingly loud color). It looks almost tactical.- Easy: It's so easy to turn on.  Simple open it up and *bam* it's on (see video). No need to fumble in the dark for a tiny switch or button.Cons:- We had a cabin fire and I threw this out the window to break the glass so we could escape.  It got lost in the bushes, and now I am saddened that my lantern is missing.  This has been a test to see if you've read my review this far.  If so, congratulations. I owe you lunch.

  We are campers. These compact, easy to use lanterns are ideal, especially for their price. For such a little laterns and not many batteries, these put off a good amount of light.. I suppose due to the led bulbs that are used in them. The hanging feature is great as well. We could place this on our picnic table or have the option to hang from the interior hook built into the roof of our tent. It provided plenty of light for us to take care of before bed things. These are a great addition to our camping bins. Shortly after we arrived home our house power had gone out, we grabbed one of these and were no longer sitting in the dark until my husband could get our generator going. I may buy a couple more to keep around the house.. much better than a flashlight in those situations, as they are directional light and these light up a room quite well.

   I dropped it and it didn't break. They both light up very well, and the plastic doesn't seem to crack or break. I was happy to find that the batteries are included. It's a very simple, straight forward approach. These will light up a tent well, provide a work area, and help when the power goes out. The handles hang well. There is no flashlight feature. These are simple straight forward Lanterns.

  I can't  say enough good things about these mini L.E.D. lanterns.When I rate a product, one of the most important criteria is, Value For The Dollar.These lanterns certainly deliver.They are light, compact and very bright.There are others on the market for a little less and some for a little more.My decision in purchasing these was that they were plastic. No rusting of the base or the body.The batteries seem to last forever.They are bright enough, that if you lock your eyes on them, your vision will get a little blurred.At roughly $7. a light, I feel I got great value for the dollar.I did read some reviews on other brands and read comments about some of the ones with the metal bases, rusting up after contact with moisture.�� JS SAYN

  I bought 3, 2 packs of these for Christmas gifts,  everyone loved them and they all worked perfectly.I (suggested) to those I bought them for to use them in the backs of their camper shells and non lighting trunks so they can see at night or use in an emergency.I was super happy with the quality for the price.  As a almost daily Amazon customer I rely heavily on the reviews and consider myself a very picky consumer.  I highly recommend these!

  Decent brightness and very rugged design.  I plan to use these as backup light when power goes out (for two to three days at a time) and for camping.  This is designed and built for room lighting, not reading.  It's a sufficient light to get around a campsite or a room, it's good for eating.  Many lights are so concentrated, so bright, that they ruin a campsite.  These are slightly less bright than our Coleman propane light, fitting well with our intended use.

  I bought these for camping.  So easy to use, super bright, super small and very lightweight. Thinking of buying more for power outages and whatnot. It's also nice that there's no switch.  Just pull up and it turns on so you can adjust the brightness by how far you pull the top up. Easy in the dark! It also came with batteries which was a nice change of pace.  Highly recommend! Oh, and they were much less $ then some others I saw.

  I bought this because a cleaning lady I follow on Instagram suggested it. My dryer is only a year old, so I almost canceled this order. I'm so thankful I didn't cancel this order. I cannot believe how much lint I removed! It's scary how much was collected on a new dryer in just a year. I'm recommending this to all my family and friends. I have a Dyson Animal vacuum, and I had to take the vacuum apart and clean it because the link blocked the vacuum from working. The annoyance of cleaning my vacuum is well worth it, though!

  Worked pretty well plus has a brush to loosen up the lint.  The hose connector is a little loose and pops off but not a big deal.  It worked exceptionally well a lot easier than taking off the dryer vent screws and vacuuming that way.  I didn’t rate the suction power bec that relates to your own vacuum cleaner.  Mine is a Shark Petplus which works magic on my laminate floors. I would def recommend this product it’s also good for cleaning behind the dryer and washer.

   i hear stranger(s) talking through mic since last Monday. i contacted wyze, sent the log file and video. we were told to change the password.  so we did.  on saturday after password is changed i was testing the mic and heard a chinese? lady and early sunday morning, there was alert with some strangers conversation recorded.  i can only upload 1 video so i’m posting one from yesterday.  i cannot tell what language is this.... and nobody was near also no one around here can speak this language.this is what wyze customer support reply from the first incident from last week.:First, if you are concerned about security the first thing you should do is change your account password to make sure you are the only one with access to the camera. If the camera is shared with any accounts I would suggest the shared account holder also resets their passwords.Next, to talk a little about our security. Our cameras utilize a point to point encrypted connection, this means that when you attempt to connect to a camera (specifically connection step 2/3) the camera and the app will perform a handshake with our servers, confirming that both have the correct encryption key that is unique to the device. This means that currently, the only options for getting access to your live feed is to have the log in information of an account with control over the camera (either the account it is setup to, or a shared account) or an Alexa device that you have allowed access to your live feeds (again, this requires the log in information for the account).anyway we changed the password and this just happened yesterday. i hope they can explain this....

   This little camera is VERY impressive. I currently own a Nest IQ indoor camera and have owned a couple Foscam indoor cameras in the past. This Wyze camera produces excellent picture quality and has a very easy to use app. The fact that you get 14 days of clips storage for free just blows the Nest cam out of the water.This camera does so much that the 10x more expensive Nest Cam IQ at a fraction of the price.So how does this stack up against the much more expensive Nest Cam IQ indoor camera?* You don't get continuous recording stored online, you only get clips stored online. However, you can pop a $10 32GB microSD card into this Wyze camera and get continuous local recording (meaning it's being recorded on the card in the device). You can view your recordings in the app. At HD quality, you get a couple days storage on a 32GB card, more if you go SD quality.*You don't get the ability to turn the camera on/off based on whether or not you are home. Personally, I really like this feature so it isn't recording us when we're home. Just feels weird. Wyze support says they may add this via IFTTT in the future. You can control whether or not motion recording is on when you are home using IFTTT. However, I""ve found it a little buggy.*You don't get the Nest IQ facial recognition which is very high tech. I'm not sure how important this is for an indoor camera. It's amazing for the Nest Hello doorbell.*You don't get a monthly fee with the Wyze cam. You pay a fee for the Nest Cam IQ.I can't believe this thing is so cheap and works so well. It has so many features like the big guys. Even the two-way audio is decent. If I had one complaint, it's that the motor that rotates the camera is a little loud. I'm still giving this 5 stars. I guess its sensitivity to sound is a little high too.It seems like it's too good to be true. If you are looking for an indoor security camera, you found it.TIP: I am using this SD card in the camera and it's working fine. Inexpensive and does the job if you want local recording - .

  Only good as a toy in close by propertiesIf your internet goes down then back up as it always sometime does in New York City or State the camera will sometimes not reconnect to your WiFi network as it has happened with 3/4 cameras .Since the camera is not responding to either WiFi or LTE your only option is to manually unplug it then plug it in againThis would solve the issue but what happens when you are a 1000 miles away ?Until Wyze ( like Nest does ) codes the software so that the camera reboots itself when attempting to re- connect these cameras are just a gimmick to watch your cat .I am not the only one having same issue as I got numerous emails from forumYou can try to fix by having WiFi AC plugs turning on Pandora off but not reliable

  I'm a bit of a camera addict.  I have hardwired (fixed) cameras that are hooked up to a DVR, and I have 4 Nest cams as well. But we have a lot of pets, and I wanted to have some PTZ cams to be able to look around and check on them when we are away.  I heard several tech podcasts (TWiT, Stacey on IoT) ranting and raving over this Wyze cam, so I took the plunge on one. WOW, how amazing to get all this, for $30 (plus shipping)!  The image is super-clear, and I LOVE the ability to scan around a room via my phone.  I even installed the Wyze app onto my Pixelbook, and when I enlarge the image on my big screen, it looks incredible.  I have only had the camera hooked up for a day, and I am still learning the ropes, but I am SO pleased, I am going to order another two, if not three cameras right away!The motion detection feature is pretty slick.  I set up the camera in our spare bedroom, where some of our cats hang out, and when Barbie came in, the camera detected her and began following her movements.  She was intrigued at the noise (noticeable, but not loud, btw) of the camera whirring, turning.  I have attached a screenshot I grabbed via the app, where she is examining the Wyze cam!  Highly recommended.

  This stuff is amazing...I did attempt to use some leftover Rug doctor formula and it did not get my carpets as clean.  I was using a Bissell Pet Pro 2x.  This stuff got my carpet and sofa clean.

  I've been using this stuff for a number of years.  It does an amazing job of getting my carpets nice and clean.  I'll get a stain on it and it won't get cleaned for quite some time until I'm ready to clean the carpets and it comes right out.  On really good stains,  I'll shoot out a little extra cleaner onto the stain and let it soak in a couple minutes and then go over it.  My Carpets almost look NEW even though they aren't.  I'm seeing some of these other pictures and the carpets are nasty.  I would never let my carpets get in that condition.  I'd be embarrassed for anyone coming over and seeing that.I normally go over each section a couple times.  Do my whole house.  Then start all over and just use water.  I always use HOT Water also.  Just using water, I still get more dirt out.  In the end, the carpets are nice and clean.  I make sure I go over them a few times to make sure it sucks up as much water as it can as it'll dry out faster.  I think the Scotch Gaurd helps getting the carpet clean once again.  So you need to use this stuff before the stains are there so that they are scotch guard protected.  Depending on how dirty your carpet is, is what level to set the machine.  A hallway, for example, gets a lot of traffic.  Heavy use!!!  If it's not really that dirty, set it to normal.  Then you don't go through the cleaner so fast.Some people maybe should look at not wearing shoes in the house!!!  I don't know what you're doing to get your carpet so nasty, but this stuff is not a miracle worker.  You have to care a little bit about where you live.  Clean far more often.  Maybe use one of the small machines to clean right away just so the carpet doesn't look like a disaster zone.  Looking not as bad as before is not good.  If should look NEW when done.  If you take care of your carpet, it will last a very long time.

  This cleaner is amazing!!! It is a little on the expensive side but WELL worth it and actually saves you time and money in the long run. I have probably used every carpet cleaning solution on the market and this one beats them all hands down. I have 3 dogs and 3 kids and I also foster animals who are not always potty trained.  This cleaner works so well that you would never know I have pets. I have used other cleaners and have had to do a couple passes with my steam cleaner just to get my floors really clean. I was beyond impressed with how great it worked after only one pass! It even got up stains that other products have left behind. I can now clean a room in half the time it used to take because I don't have to go over the carpet again and again. It scent isn't over powering and it got rid of every odor my carpet had absorbed. I really saw a difference when I ran out of this product half way through cleaning my sons carpet. I grabbed what I had left of another cleaner, that I used to really like, and I was surprised at the difference in my carpet. The other cleaner left my carpet looking dingy and a little rough. This cleaner left the carpet very soft and extreemly clean. I love it and won't use anything else again!

  Best carpet cleaning solution I've ever used in 36 years of doing it myself.  I've tried about every cleaning solution on earth.  I have a light Berber carpet in my home office that is heavily used by me and my English Cocker girl.  It has been getting progressively darker, with obvious signs of traffic for about 13 years.  It is high quality carpet, but I'd been thinking it may be time to ditch it.  That would be difficult due to the heavy bookcases and a built-in granite desk in the room.Along comes Bissell 78H6B to save the day!  I had to go over the carpet several times due to the years of ground in dirt and stain, but it's clean.  My office floor now looks like it was installed new yesterday.  The regular plush carpet in my front entry and living-dining room has been rehabilitated now also.  It had some recurring stains from my Cocker's early mistakes that had me cleaning that carpet about every two months for five years.  It now looks new also, with no evidence of her inexperience left to be noticed.Unbelievable!  I'd give this carpet cleaning solution 10 stars if I could.  I use a Bissell machine, too.  Easy to use and clean up afterwards.

  I tried this and at first thought nothing could clean our carpets .I live in a apartment and the carpeting as been here for a long time and through many other renters.They never changed it and even though they had it cleaned before I moved in, The stains popped back up after just a few weeks of living here .The carpet was looking horrible and went through a few winters and lots of tracking through with shoes on and with the already stained spots it was horrible to look at.I was desperate and bought a carpet cleaner and my husband thought we should try this .Well I did not think anything could clean this carpet , or get the stains out that have been here since the place was built and the news ones made from my two cats.Well to our surprised it worked.Not only did it get it looking clean , but it made it look new and I also use it for spot touch ups when my cats throw up from time to time , as cats do .I love this product and will continue using it and recommending it to anyone who wants to have a clean carpet that looks great.

  I suffered for many years from a severe case of carpel tunnel syndrome.  It probably all began because I work for a commercial designing company, and I spend about 8-10 hours a day doing 3D rendering on the computer, which entails a lot of using the keypad and mouse. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with tingling in my hands and sometimes with severe pain. I spent many restless nights twisting and turning in bed.I was advised by my Dr. to try wearing a night brace, and desperate to find a solution to the endless pain I stopped into my local pharmacy to pick up a handbrace from a big brand. I wore it for a few weeks and didn't see any difference, the pain at night was still severe and sleeping at night was almost a thing of the past. Nothing was working until I bought this comfybrace.After using this brace for one night I realized this was really making a big difference. I right away saw major improvement. After months of not being able to sleep at night I started getting a couple of hours of shut eye in a row!! This was a major breakthrough for me. Now that i'm wearing it for two weeks, night pain is a thing of the past. I thought surgery was my only solution, but maybe this is an easier solution!!!This comfybrace is made of durable material which makes it very soft yet sturdy and therefore my hands weren't sweaty from it. Another thing which was very important to me was the super soft and comfortable cushioning beads by the palm. The beads are soft enough that they got molded to the shape of my hand and hold my hand perfectly in that position.My hands are pretty average size for a man, and this glove fits me perfectly!! This brace is really adjustable so it would probably fit most hand sizes, including pretty slim hands and husky ones too.This brace is also made of very high quality materials and is stitched together very strongly. I can see that this will really last me a while. You can also see the picture I have attached showing the high quality stitching.I highly recommend this brace, and it's definitely worth the money. It's not worth  wasting nights when there is such an easy and affordable solution available.Thank you so much Comfy Brace!!!

  I am an RN and have severe issues with carpel tunnel for a very long time that wakes me up frequently from sleep and causes pain when trying to lift or crochet. In fact many nights, the pain is unbearable with numbness in my fingers and stabbing burning elbow and wrist pain. I have tried many braces before and while some have helped, most have been too uncomfortable to wear at night so I have not been consistent in using them. I was hesitant to buy another one, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give this one a try. The first time I put it on I knew it was different with the padding and overall comfort. One of my biggest issues was most other braces felt very warm and making my arm feel clammy and hot, and being from South Texas, I don't want anything making me feel warmer than we already are. I slept all night that first night and most other nights since using it. While I know a brace wont eliminate the problem completely, I recommend this brace for anyone dealing with this painful and annoying issue especially during flare ups of the condition and symptoms. I am getting another just to have for travel as I am very impressed with this product. Whoever created this must have had the issue of carpal tunnel and been frustrated with the current braces on the market and fixed them!! Bravo to you!!

  In the past year or so, I've started twisting one hand and wrist under my head as I sleep, which results in hand swelling and pain when I wake up. My doctor suggested wearing a brace to discourage me from twisting my wrist as I sleep.Well! Easier said than done! I tried two or three braces before this one. One was okay to wear but barely provided any support and did not prevent the twist. Another gave firmer support but was so uncomfortable that I removed in in my sleep (yeah, lifelong sleepwalker here).So then I tried the Comfy Brace. I was a little dubious since it does not come in a right or left hand version, the brace will fit either hand which I thought might mean it would not fit well. I was sooo wrong.Wowza, it works a charm! The three straps provide a more customisable fit so it can be firm enough to discourage the twist but still comfortable enough that I leave it on in my sleep. The cushion full of beads is brilliant--I put it on, wiggle my fingers once or twice, the beads shift into position and I honestly can't feel the metal support (part of the problem with the uncomfortable brace was that the end of the metal support tended to dig into my palm).It has definitely helped my wrist and hand without being uncomfortable at all. It fits like it was made specifically for my hand. Either hand! I've only used it for a couple months, so I don't know yet how it will last (still feels like new). If I ever wear it out, I'll buy another. No more experimenting, this is definitely the perfect design for me.

  This lock always was “sticky” and jammed constantly. Not the situation you want to be in on a cold night trying to unlock your bike in a sketchy hood to go home. I always wondered if it was me, or if I inadvertently re set it but then at the last minute would unlock! After a min. of 10-15 minutes. Finally it did not after two people tried & I had to cut the cable clean off with my Dremel, (plastic cutting disc and metal cutting disc) which I was just lucky enough to have nearby. Every time this jammed on me, it was always a bad time for it to happen. Also I have to physically wrestle with the too strong cable which never relaxed, always strangling my bike and stressing me out.This is really a 5 star review for the Dremel!

  This lock lasted less than a week before my bike was stolen. The thief broke the lock at the ""key"" insert. From the fracture, it's easy to see that the material used was very brittle.

  This is an economic but durable solution for situation when you want to lock your bike in a public place. The section of the cable is by no means thick enough to deter anyone who really wants your bike. I would not let my bike with this lock overnight in critical areas, but this lock is fantastic when you stroll downtown and stop for a coffee or lunch somewhere. It comes with a fix combination, meaning you cannot set a more memorable one for yourself. Make sure you mark the four digits down somewhere (phone, maybe?) so you do not look like an idiot trying to steal your own bike!

  Going with the Master Lock brand I thought it'd be a solid build. It was cheap, but I didn't expect it to be cheaply constructed. It all works as intended, it's just not very sturdy. One of the locks fell apart when my kid dropped it off his handlebars. The number wheels literally fell off. I didn't try yanking it apart when it was locked but it made me less trusting that it'd stand a good tug if someone wanted the bike.I'd recommend you spend a few extra dollars for something sturdier.-- This is how I rate my purchases --5 Stars: Product works exactly as advertised, is a good value at the price point purchased, and I would buy it again or recommend to a friend.4 Stars: Product works exactly as advertised, fit/finish are what you'd expect when purchasing this type of product, but the product may leave more to be desired.3 Stars: Product generally works but it may not be a good value at the price point or may need some improvement. I probably wouldn't buy it again.2 Stars: Product barely works but can be made useful if you try. I would not recommend for purchase.1 Star : Product does not perform as intended and in my opinion is probably a waste of money.That's my review scale. I also want to point out that if I receive a product that I would give three stars or below to I usually contact the vendor and let them know the problem.

  First and foremost if you use the adhesive pads these come with expect them not to hold for very long.  They will stick initially but then will come free after a week or two, or faster if they are exposed to heat like sunlight.  I would peel off the adhesive disk and replace it with some 3M VHB.The rubber for the holders is firm, and quality.  Holds cords just fine.  In my experience they don’t lose their integrity or begin seeping oils or anything.  I say this because some others I have used do this and get oily or sticky after a while.  These don’t.

  I saw these on a YouTube video about how well they work and how well they make your desk look. I bought the pack of them figuring I would use one or two. But I used them all except for one. What a difference it made instead of having wires all over the place!! Check out the pictures and you can hardly see any wires at all on my desk.Please ignore the wires on the walls,I am in the process of hiding all of them as well.They are made out of soft rubber that will last for years.Some things made of rubber have a bad smell These smell like Steak!! lol just kidding they have no smell at all, the adhesive is fantastic!!! I used rubbing alcohol to clean the spot where I was going to stick it too. one of those rubber clips has the weight of a extension cord pulling on it and it has not pulled off the clip yet and its been roughly 5 days now.But on the other hand you can take these off without hurting the furniture. I decided to take a clip off and figured i probably couldn't reuse it. It took some force to remove but it came off and I was able to use it in another spot. These things are GREAT!! I should of gotten them years ago!!

  Years ago I upgraded the phone cord in my bedroom to a 10ft cord. Life changing! However, even when I tuck it under my pillow in the morning when I get up, half the time, it falls down behind my headboard, and I have to fish it back out when I get in bed at night. Did I mention I've been doing this for years?! So when I saw this product, I thought, OMFG, maybe this will finally solve one of my most annoying little first world problems. And it has indeed delivered!I stuck one on my headboard, slightly below where my mattress hits, so it's not visible. Hooked the phone cord on, and voila! When the cord falls off my bed, it's still hanging on this! Such a stupid simple thing, but it's so annoying to have to get up once you're all wrapped in your blankets, and go fishing for a phone cord. I've also stuck a couple of these in my car, to help organize the cords in there, and in my desk area at home and work. Super super handy little things!!

  These are great!  Exactly what I wanted for routing a couple of cords around.  The single slot clips are big enough to fit a standard cord or a light duty indoor extension cord, but it's still small enough that I was able to put my USB-C cable for my phone in it without it just falling out.I'm not sure why I've seen so many people saying that they should have 3m tape instead of generic, or that they had to replace the tape on them with 3m.  The tape on these is clearly marked with the 3m branding.

Not one of the stickers has stayed put.  Avoid this product or maybe the ones I got were duds.  The holder part looks well made but that doesn’t really matter when they don’t stay put. I tried them on a 50 degree day and on a 65 degree day.  Not applied in direct sunlight or really hot heat.  I’m stumped.  What a waste of time and money.

  I wanted to like these. I mean they are a great concept, but the execution of their primary function - organising cables and keeping them organised - is sorely lacking.The primary issue with these cable clips is that there is too much of a gap in each slot to really hold anything in place. As you try to slide a cable in/out, it more often than not pops out of the channel it's supposed to rest in, which kind of renders the whole thing pointless.These need to be made so that the gap between grip points is significantly smaller, thus allowing the cable to be inserted and slid back and forth without coming out until you really want it to.Off to find something better...

  Ordered this set for office, home, and vehicle use.The ones at my desk stay stuck just fine. They're on a flat surface for cable management and have little to no friction or downward pull. At home they're just fine too. Also on a flat, horizontal surface with little to no friction or pull.But the ones in my car that I use to organize my wires for AUX and charging have already fallen off after about 2 weeks of being in place on a vertical surface with light to no tugging or friction. I'll be looking into how to replace the adhesive on the bottom with something a bit stronger; as this was the primary reason I bought them.

  These cable clips actually have a strong grip.  I got mine for holding pens, and I accidentally stuck on in an off center position and can't get it off.  I mean, I can't get it off ! ! !  Its ok with me though, because the last 3 pen holders i bought either fell off on their own or peeled off easily.  These adhesive on these is tough and I like that!I purchased this on Amazon, thought I haven't seen the ""VERIFIED PURCHASE"" checkbox on any of my reviews for the last two years.

  I read mixed reviews about whether this was waterproof or not (needed to patch a couple intex above ground vinyl pool leaks). I tried it both inside and outside the (filled) pool, and neither worked in any way that could be called successful.We have some other tape that worked really well on the outside of the pool, so this is just an inferior product. I do not recommend using this for anything water-related. As soon as it was applied to the leak in the image, it bubbled up and leaked (the surrounding area was dried off first just to give it the best chance possible). As soon as the other tape was applied, there was no bubble at all and no leak.The funny part was when we tried to apply it on the inside underwater (the reason I bought this tape in the first place). We cut it into a circle and applied it as fast as possible, but it simply didn't stick except for the tiniest area. It lost all adhesion to the rest of the patch area and was completely ineffective at stopping the leak.

  Difficult to cut, virtually impossible to tear, and grabs immediately with a bond on hard surfaces is so strong that it is daunting to remove (so position it right the first time.) All of which are highly desirable characteristics in a ""patch and seal"" tape. At my house It is performing beautifully as a patch for a damaged gutter corner lasting through 90+ degree heat, freezing cold, and driving rain. Even better it is almost unnoticeable and is likely to remain as the permanent repair.  The only failure I have encountered was an attempt to patch a hole in my car's underwood insulation, it did not stick to the fabric but presented a real challenge to remove where it had stuck to the metal along one edge.  I have seen complaints that the edge of the roll is sticky, and it is, but that can be handy when you are working on a ladder or in a precarious location. Just slap the roll on a nearby hard surface and it isn't going to roll or fall off while you are working.I have tried competing products, but none of them performed as well as Gorilla Weatherproof Patch and Seal Tape/

  I patched several holes in vinyl skirting today and the tape was simple to work with.  Unpeel about half the tape, stick it in place and unpeel the rest, rubbing the edges down well.  I used a box knife with a fresh blade to cut the tape.  Goo-Gone took off the adhesive residue from the blade when I was done.  Will update this review when some time has passed re: weather proofing and long term adherence.  So far, so good!

  I used this tape to seal window casings in a sun room in my home that has excessive dry rot. The windows really need to be replaced but we don’t want to put money into the room because we intend to tear it down when we eventually add an addition. The wood was cracking and weak in places. I used this tape to seal off whatever outside elements were trying to make their way in and keep the casing from further cracking. I’m guessing bad things are still going to happen behind the tape, but it worked great for my purposes. Tape is strong and smooth and the white blends in so you don’t notice it too much. I would purchase again for such a “repair” - the only annoying thing was the sticky side is a grey color and would sometimes peek out on the sides of the tape, the way glue would push out when you push two surfaces together. I should have just left it alone but instead I tried to rub it away with my nail and it seemed to make it worse. It was like trying to remove sticky adhesive when you tear a label off something and have to push the adhesive into a clump and pick that clump up with the label, tape, or your fingernails. Anyways, not a deal breaker by any means, but when trying to maintain all white against my white painted wood the grey spots were more noticeable than I anticipated.

  Not sure if it is quality control, old stock or a bad product, but this item started unfurling after opening it. I gave 5 stars for ""easy to remove"" as a joke since it did not go on. Thought I was doing something wrong like there was a backing I wasn't aware of, but no, just poor product. May work if batch is good, but I am not willing to try. As a side note, if there are rolls that work, it seems designed well. Smooth, shiny surface with cushioning between surface and adhesion side. Too bad, but beware the failure of this one may be a sign of its long-term reliability.

  Love how well it works!We didn't drain the pool enough and the tape got wet but once the tape dries it gets sticky again. Definitely worth the money if you need to repair and are not ready to replace. Saved us $6,000 for a new liner, now will save up for new liner next year.

  ... ironically are not waterproof.My project would have gone better without this. It's not the product's fault per se but it's impractical to use. I was using it in tight confines and attempting to get a straight, flat install in a restricted space turned out impossible. Worse, is it was impossible to fix properly.

   After X'mas I realized these LED light strips will be my main holiday lights in the future! We attach the strips inside the house alongside the window frames, people can see the lights from outside, how amazing! Here is my daughter's feedback:These lights are amazing!! There are 20 colors and lots of different modes. There’s slow changing modes, fast changing modes as well as modes that change to the dynamics of the music you are playing! I personally like the red purple and blue because it’s darker and great for a great vibe. Also, the lights automatically turn off after a long while if you don’t change color or do anything and that’s great because it helps you save electricity if you fall asleep. There’s tape on the back of the lights so it makes it easy to tape to the wall. Love it!

  It worked great for the first couple days, stuck on really well, was very bright, i was so happy with it. Not even 4 days after i got it it starts randomly changing. I usually keep it on the fade mode and all of a sudden it will just start flashing or go to one of the music modes. I made sure the remote was far away from me so i wasn’t touching it by accident and closed the app on my phone just in case and it still keeps happening. Waste of money and all the time it took to set up.EDIT: It ended up being my tv remote that was interfering with it, so keep that in mind if your lights keep changing out of nowhere. They work great for the price

  For the price, I can't ask for more.  I've bought a variety of different styles of lights over the years, and thus far I like these the best.  Not only is the adhesive VERY effective on these, but the connection to the phone app was super easy.  Others in the past have always had problems connecting to the phone.  Not these!  I bought this particular set for my daughter's play room and she adjusts them with her tablet.  She's 10 and can use the app without an issue, so it's definitely a winner in my book.

  I installed these in my bedroom and I love them.  I ended up using tape, and will probably go to the store and buy something a bit more proper as far as adhesives go.  The kit doesn't come with nearly enough adhesive tabs, like 12, and if you really want to frame elements with the lights, you'll need more.  But as far as the product goes, couldn't be better- really really cool, everything I wanted.  I really cant believe these are only 22 bucks.  I will definitely be ordering more and get my whole house lit.

  I use these and a straight pair (from Home Depot) to prune my plants and especially, wet trim my Flower... and I always find myself going to these over the others.The curved tip makes it super easy to get in there and snipped tiny bits, like sugar leaves. They are very precise. I couldnt imagine trimming/ pruning without these. They are sharp and hold up to quite a bit of abuse. Like all my other pruners, I completley removed the little plastic lock; as they sometimes lock themselves when you close them during a cut! The spring in them is strong enough to always return them to the open position quick and snappy. Im not sure how much the ""coating"" (gold finish) helps? I find that I have to clean them of sticky residue as often as any other tool, it may help with the smoothness of shearing though?PROS:Very smooth cutting actionBuilt to lastVery durableSharpStrong Snappy SpringVery accurate (curved tip keeps it tight)High quality material/ BuildLightweightErgonomicCONS:sometimes lock themselves when in closed position (I just removed the lock; problem solved)If you found my review helpful - it would be much appreciated if you pass that help along and kindly click the found ""helpful"" button.

  These are perfect!  I've had these over a week & have already used them nearly every day. They get right into tiny or close spots & snip stems right off, they work great for deadheading or cutting flowers including roses, petunias, pansies, dianthus pinks, vinca, coreopsis, whatever!  My mint, oregano & rosemary herbs were trying to flower & I trimmed the tops right off all of them lickity-split faster than ever before. They actually make deadheading flowers & plants fun because it's so easy!  Plus they are small & light so they don't hurt or tire my hands to use & I can easily open & close the lock one handed so I can quickly snip, snip, snip away!  I think I may buy a second pair because they are so handy. The only thing I wish is that they had a cap because they easily fit right in my pocket but that end is super pointy, I'm surprised I haven't poked or scratched myself on them yet lol. However that is my only ""negative"" & certainly not a big enough issue to detract a review star or my enthusiasm for these great little clippers!  If you have plants or flowers buy these, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them! ����**One month update**I still LOVE these clippers!  They have been used almost daily to deadhead my flowers & my flowers show their happiness at that!  I really don’t know how I got by without them before & I find it to be very relaxing to use these each evening to dead head & clean up my plants, I find myself almost disappointed if I can’t find anything to snip off lol.  If you have flowers, herbs or other plants you need these!! ��⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️��

  Take a moment to look at the picture I've included. This did not happen from harsh use or prying with the blades. This is what happened to one of the blades of these gardening scissors when I placed it in over-the-counter, 70% ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL for a few minutes to disinfect before use.The end has literally curled up. It was perfectly straight when I opened them to place them in the 70% isopropyl alcohol. I placed them with the blades down inside a glass. There was no pressure on them.The metal literally softened in simple drugstore alcohol. Gravity did the rest.Needless to say, I do not recommend these. In fact, I enthusiastically warn you away from these if you want something made from stainless steel—because stainless steel does not melt in isopropyl alcohol.These were Amazon's Choice for ""garden scissors."" Don't trust the algorithm that determines this this ""choice"" to deliver quality. ""Amazon's Choice,"" particularly lately for me, has become synonymous with ""the cheapest trash we'd like to move fast."" I've had to return several items that were all Amazon Choice items.

  These hand pruners are fairly cheaply made, except for the actual cutting surfaces. The plastic components feel flimsy and the lock does not inspire much confidence. They do however get the job done. For smaller plants (ferns as opposed to more resilient vegetation) this cuts with ease. I would expect them to handle anything much more. 6.5"" refers to the total length of the tool, not the blades.PROS:+ Inexpensive+ Quality blades+ Cuts smaller plans wellCONS:- Not the highest of quality- Lock feels especially weak

  These filters consistently under-perform.  The manufacturer claims up to 40 gallons or approximately 2 months for a filter. That's a lie. I've been keeping track and measuring every drop of water I drink. They barely last me 10 gallons - which works out to around 2 weeks for me. Then the water starts flowing so slowly through them that I can fill the pitcher before bed and it still hasn't filtered completely by morning, 8 hours later. If it takes all day to filter a couple glasses of water then they're useless in any practical sense. It'd take a lifetime to actually put 40 gallons of water through with the way it slows down.At first I considered maybe the possibility I got counterfeit or generic filters from Amazon sellers so I've been giving it another chance purchasing them in person at two different major retailers. I've tried both the lead reduction and the standard filter. Not a single one works for more than about 2 weeks. In some cases I've had them clog up and start moving slowly after just a few days. I've a couple mysteriously work a lot longer than the rest, but even those didn't make it to the 2 month mark.Yes I've followed the directions on the packaging with regards to soaking them etc, ensuring they sink in my soaking container and there's no trapped air bubbles. I've tried the tricks where you shake them or run water through them backwards. (The fact people even have to post tips & tricks and elaborate instructions to make them work should tell you something.)I've concluded not only are these simply are not a good value, but the manufacturer is deceptive in their claims. I'm not only going to switch to a different system ASAP but I'm going to research my options for a class action lawsuit. Looking through other reviews here and complaints all across the Internet I'm not alone and this particular product has *really* annoyed me. (Nothing worse than be thirsty on a hot day and seeing the water you poured into the pitcher HOURS ago is still sitting at the top!) Somebody needs to fight back on behalf of all the negative reviews and other ripped off consumers.

  I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about.  These produce perfectly tasty water and absolutely removes a ton of the chlorine and other “purification” elements from the water company.  I need to disagree with others, these work and the only downside is they’re not immediately filtering water - but that sort of demonstrates it’s a thorough process.  PUR products are definitely better than Brita, I’ve had mine for over three years and have been replacing only these.UPDATE: I now know what others are talking about.  Something happened with the quality of these.  I've ordered these in the past and I didn't have to wait days for water to be filtered.

  I've been using the PUR Pitchers for years now, however this is the first time I bought this ""Lead Reduction"" replacement filter. Usually I would purchase the ""Basic"" replacement filter in the past, which I've probably have replaced at least 10 times. But I decided to buy the ""lead reduction"" replacement filter and this filter doesn't even TASTE like it filtered ANYTHING.This so-called ""filtered"" water is horrible, it taste like I'm drinking lead. I usually used the water from the pitcher to make food and coffee with daily and couldn't figure out why everything taste so different. Then I finally tired drinking the water by itself, once I ran out of bottled water (I know I need to stop buying bottled). I immediately realized that it wasn't bad vegetables or bad coffee grinds, it was the water from the ""lead reduction"" filter. I'm not sure if I will go back to the ""basic"" one with the blue cap, because now I'm questioning the ""PUR"" brand.

  We had used the standard PUR pitcher filters for about 25 years and jumped at the opportunity to try these new PUR Ultimate Lead Reduction Pitcher filters.  Although they continue to suffer from slow flow like the standard PUR pitcher filters, the water clearly tastes better.  I might not be a scientist with a lead tester to measure parts-per-million, but I have repeatedly been able to tell the difference between tap water, mineral water, and filtered water in blind taste tests.  These filters definitely make the water taste better than the standard ones.  Thanks PUR!

  I was unsure about these not being the traditional decorated curtain hook. I love these. They slide on the rod so smoothly and give it a very nice look. They don't draw your eye to them which is great because that is not their point.

I can't tell you why, but it's comforting.  Wouldn't be if I had to listen to it for hours, but as you just open or close the curtain, it's nice!  I went ahead bought them for my other 2 showers because I like them so much!

  THIS IS NOT AN AIR CONDITIONER! So many people are mad because its not cooling down their space like an a/c would. It is an evaporative cooler. The way it works is the same way sweat works when you sweat. A minimal amount of water is formed into a mist, which a fan blows across wet filter elements, and in turn gives a nice chilly breeze when its blowing on you. It wont work in your car, get your a/c fixed. It wont cool down a room of any size, get a a/c unit. What it will do it make a hot room feel more comfortable when your in it by giving you a cool breeze. I use it for my bedroom, blowing directly onto me, to keep me comfortable while sleeping. The a/c in the house doesnt make the upstairs cool, so this is the next option....the final option would be to get a a/c unit in my room. Works exactly the way its intended to.

  I bought mine at Walmart and just came on here to see what reviews said but tbh mine is great. Its obviously not going to fill a whole room or operate as well as an actual air conditioner might but If you keep air flow with in 5 feet of area you trying to cool down it works great. The air is already cool when you use it but if you want it really cold what I have done is soaked the filter for 5 to 10 min in water then freeze it, once frozen take it out run it under water very quickly one last time then put it in the Artic. Also instead of adding water only to the tank add crushed ice. This gets it really cold and you actually would think its AC if it were bigger. I will always add crushed ice it's best way to do it in my opinion.  You can also add some essential oil to filter heads if you want added bonus of great calming smell....add mint and the air actually feels even colder. It's not too loud either you definately can hear it but no more than a normal fan and after a while it just becomes white noise. My only con would be the night light. I was kinda hoping it was brighter and led looking like the last version of this product which I never owned but have seen other people use. This light is in the water tank so it's not nearly as bright but good enough if your not looking for an actual lamp like light but just some small luminous appeal.

  Works as intended. Won’t allow anyone to get into my apartment (I’ve been having some random people try to open my door lately. Not sure they just accidentally went to the wrong door or if they were seeing if my apartment was unlocked). One star off only because it’s a little loose and shakes around, even when in place on the door, and also because it scratches up the paint aroundthe door when putting it on. Very minor (and may rub off) but worth noting.

  We took this device anytime we were staying at a hotel (Foxwood's) or an AirB&B we rented. It is easy to figure out how to set it on the door striker.  You can download a video for directions. It has 2 sizes you can choose depending on the size of your striker. This is great for added security while for you at home or traveling. Our granddaughter uses it if she is home alone after school. When you go to a hotel, a lot of people have access to your room like the housekeeper or maintenance workers. You just attach this to the door while you are in the room for extra protection.These are very inexpensive and we have given them out as gifts to family and friends. We highly recommend this product!

0,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"OXO Good Grips Silicone Drain Protector for Pop-Up & Regular Drains, Grey, One Size",$9.99,4,"
  I am not a frequent rater, but I spent some time with the two most popular drain covers for pop-up drains (OXO and Lekeye) and I wanted to share what I learned. The bottom line: neither is perfect, but I'm going to stick with the OXO.What I am looking for:--works with a pop-up drain (photo), TIE--stays put when showering, TIE--catches my hair (long straight caucasian hair), Lekeye wins by a little--allows water flow, Lekeye wins until there is a hair buildup (see details)--easy to clean, OXO wins by a landslideLonger version:I first bought the OXO for my new shower that I wanted to protect from hair clogs. I liked it, but every time I showered, there would be soapy water left standing at the end. This is because my hair would start to clog the bottom holes, and THERE ARE NO HOLES ON THE BASE (photo). I got into the habit of cleaning it off and then giving the shower a quick cold-water rinse, EVERY TIME I showered. It was fine, but I thought I could do better.So I bought the Lekeye because I could see that there are a lot more holes on the bottom part of the cover. Because of that, it does drain better than the OXO, especially at first. The issue is that the base is covered in little nubs (photo) to catch the hairs. And it does a great job of it! The problem is, I find it hard to get the hair off of the nubs. So I kept my habit of cleaning every time, but each day a little more hair would remain on the cover. So now, it no longer drains that well and is kind of gross after a few days of use.Bottom line: if you are concerned about your hair slipping through, the Lekeye is a more ""sticky"" cover. My hair is not particularly thick, though, and the OXO catches a ton of hair. I'm not concerned that much is getting through. But in the end, given that I need to clean both regularly, I'm going with OXO which is a quick wipe and then done. I still can't get the hair off the Lekeye to pass it on.

  After tossing away quite a few cheap-o drain protectors that became dingy over time no matter how I soaked and scrubbed them, I decided to splurge on this OXO silicone drain protector.  I've been very impressed!  It's tall enough to fit easily over my pop-up drain and (even without suction cups) the weighted top keeps it in place -- even with my faucet running almost directly on it [see photo - my water pressure is quite decent but your mileage may vary!].  I have medium-length hair and seem to shed almost as much as my cat, but the drain protector catches it all and is easily removed and tossed away.  Best of all, in my case, the silicone hasn't held onto mildew or mold -- I have been able to spray and wipe away any grime with very little effort.  It looks like this drain protector will last a very long time.  This has been a very worthy purchase for the few dollars more!

  Perfect for the bath to catch my long hair and my pet’s fur. It fits nicely over my popped up plug and you can push down on the cover to start/stop the drain as well since it’s flexible rubber.  My water does drain a little slower, but that’s fine. It also stays in place and does not slide round or lift up.

  It took me way too long to find this product - I'd never had pop up style trains before and it took me a lot of trial and error to find a drain protector that would fit.My partner and I both have longish hair and despite the fact that we do our best to contain/collect what sheds in the shower our current apartment's shower drain would get plugged every 2-4 weeks.  It was always because of hair and while not difficult to remedy, it was always supremely disgusting to clean out.We'd never had this many issues but we'd also never had this style of drain before.  I'm not a fan.  The 'pop up' part was always closing itself mid shower so we took it out leaving the drain fully exposed. We spent a lot of time trying to find a cover that was a) functional and b) fit...  I had given up when this popped up on my ""recommended for you"" list.  Thanks Amazon.We've only had this for about two weeks but I'm a huge fan.  As others have said, it stays in place, catches an unseemly amount of hair (despite us both continuing to catch what we can) and is easy to clean.  My one complaint is that the lip around the edge does cause a slight drainage backup, but it's minor compared to the ankle deep water we'd get when the drain was clogged AGAIN.I clean off any hair right after I shower - this prevents the hair from getting crusted on (gross) and any remaining water to drain out (which keeps the tub clean longer)

  I've been using these for a few years, and I just picked up some more because I liked them so much. One thing to be aware of - since these gripper hooks sit right up against the wall, they work best for things that are flat and don't stick out too much. For example, if you have a mop with a large bulky head, it may not work as well as a broom that's more flat. I am able to use it for my Rubbermaid Reveal mop, but it requires a bit of manipulating to get it to hang properly. But otherwise, they feel very secure on the wall, and I am very happy with them!

  I was using regular command hooks on the back of my basement door to hold my broom, mop, swiffer, etc. Every time I opened the door they swung all over the place, sometimes falling off (they have strange handles). I found these and WOW! What a difference. Highly recommend. Items stay in place, easy to remove for use and replacing is a breeze, too. What did we do before command hooks???Hint. If using on the back of a door, place the command holder somewhat toward the middle of the handle instead of at the top. This will help prevent swinging when you open and close the door.  I haven't had an issue with items sliding but if I do I'll wrap a rubber band around the handle.

  I ordered one of these broom grippers to hold my kitchen broom off the floor (to keep the bristles in better shape) and hung up on the back of the closet door.  Been a couple of months now and it works well, so I ordered two more.  I did clean/dry the surface well before adhering the strip to the closet door and waited 24 hours before hanging the broom up (in the gripper).  I used one to grip my cane upright and keep it from falling on the floor when I am working at my desk.  Worked so well I put another gripper for my cane on my nightstand too.  I have arthritic hands so I had to practice using the gripper effectively (roll the handle in and out rather than jamming it in) to allow me to use it easily (without hand/wrist pain).I tried to use one to hang up my aluminum snow shovel but the diameter of the handle was too big for the gripper unfortunately.  Shovel might have been too heavy too?  Specs say: will hold up to 4 lbs and 0.8-1.0"" handles.  Not sure what a 0.8-1.0"" handle is.  My cane measures 3.5"" around and weighs a little more than 1 lb.  The kitchen broom handle measures 2.85"" around (OD?) and weighs about a pound too.

  I’m a lifelong Brita user so I was thrilled to see they finally made a countertop filter that catches lead!  I followed the set-up instructions precisely and at first everything seemed fine.  The water filtered a little more slowly than the regular Brita filters, but no big deal, and it tasted great.  However, within 2-3 weeks, each filter in this two-pack slowed to a CRAWL, barely filtering a single batch of water in 8 hours (!).  I then looked up the official Brita instructions for unclogging these filters and followed those to a “t.”  That didn’t help one bit.  Shortly after trying to fix each of the two filters, black flecks flooded out of them (see first photo).Now, the box specifically advertises “no black flecks” (see second photo) and “lasts 3x longer than standard Brita filters” so to have two of these filters last at most 3 weeks each and then vomit black flecks – this is either a defective product or false advertising.  I see on here a lot of people have complained about similar problems and Brita just offers coupons for money off your next purchase.  That’s ridiculous.  Refund or replace, Brita!

  I can't believe I purchased these filters without first reading the negative reviews.  The negative reviews are TRUE.  I installed the first filter on July 18, 2018 and could not believe how long it took to empty the reservoir.  Then, on August 1, 2018 it STOPPED WORKING.  This is 2 weeks for a filter that is advertised as being good for 6 months.  Also, the taste of the filtered water is not as good as I expected it to be.  Bottled water is better.  After being a long time Britta user I am looking for a new filter system.  With all the bad reviews it seems like either Britta or Amazon no longer care about their product or their customers.  Maybe Mr. Bezos is more concerned with his space efforts than his company.September 1, 2018FOLLOW UP REVIEWFollowing my critical review I was contacted by Britta and given a telphone number and a reference number.I called the number and was given the option of a refund or receive a replacement 2 pack of Longlast filters.  Since I have had a long and satisfactory relationship with Britta I chose the replacement option.  BIG MISTAKE!! The replacement filters were as defective as those I received originally.  The first filter was installed on August 17, 2018.  By August 30 it was taking 6 to 8 hours for the reservoir to empty through the filter.  AND there is now a blotchy, streaky substance on the interior of the white reservoir.When I initially called Britta I was told that about 10% of their filters from an un-named manufacturer were defective.  What are the odds that I would get the defective ones a second time?BUYER BEWARE!!

  We purchased a Brita carafe water pitcher to filter our NYC tap water. I was very attracted to the idea of a long-lasting filter that would not only remove more contaminants than the basic white Brita filter, but also last much longer. We bought these Brita brand filters thinking that their much higher price would be offset by lasting much longer than the white ones. Wrong. They may be removing more stuff from the water but they clogged up way before the expected number of gallons suggested by Brita's literature. For the first few weeks of use, water flowed quickly. Then the flow slowed down and now you need to wait patiently for the filter to do its thing. End result: more expensive way to get filtered water than the basic white Brita filter. Can't comment on removal of the contaminants. The taste of the water was not noticeably different.

  These ""longlasting"" filters are not longlasting at all. Ours became unusable after like two months: It was so slow that it took hours to fill up the water pitcher.Brita's customer services gives you all kinds of useless tips to mitigate this problem. You are supposed to put them in water, rinse them, squeeze them etc. Nothing works. Just search for ""brita longlast filter slow"" and see for yourself. You will find a lot of angry comments on Brita's website as well. We will keep our Brita water pitcher, but we will definitely never waste our money on these again.

  Total junk! Takes over a day to drain once.  Unacceptable!I can't even believe this product still exists.  If I could have, I would have given NO STARS.  It was slow to begin with and only got slower and slower.  We go through about 4 fills per day(about 2 gallons) in our house(with the regular filters).  This filter was always slower and would take over an hour to drain one time, even when it was new.  But after a month or two, it began to take multiple hours to drain once. Now, I realized that I can fill it at night and then in the morning, it's drained less than half way.

  I have been using Brita filters for years. At first this filter, which is shorter than the latest filters for full-size pitchers, didn't seem to fit: The filter has only 1 groove and did not fit the cross frame of the pitcher, and didn't even seem to go down all the way to the frame. I almost wrote an angry email, then I tried 1 last time to insert the Longlast filter, TWIST AND TURN AT the same time WHILE PUSHING DOWN and the single groove of the filter did catch 1 part of the cross frame of the pitcher and lock in place. It is tightly sealed, although you can see that 3/4 of the bottom of the filter is not touching the cross frame. Fitration is slow but good and the seal is good. I bought this filter because of the multiple failures in lead contamination testing in schools around the good old city of San Diego. I will not go back to any filter that doesn't take care of lead. I took out 2 stars for the stupid design. Some people in the RnD department at Brita need to go back to school to learn the basics of ergonomics and customer satisfaction. They must have been on their phones checking Facebook and Instagram in class and taking selfies during the lectures.

  Good item, but plastic casings come off easily and magnets can fall out. This can be frustrating. Solution...when you first get this, spread it out on the floor with enough distance between plastic casings to prevent them from being attracted to each other. Try to remove the plastic casings. If a casing is easily removed/pops out easily, use transparent gorilla glue, snap it back together, and wait a few hours for the glue to set. After the glue sets, go ahead and install on your doorway.

  ok - here's the thing. it works and the magnets close and all of that is awesome, however they include nails with it as suggestions, but you actually need to use them. So don't think that you can just tape it up and it stays - it will for a day maybe, but then you will need to use the nails. But it works - the mosquitos and flies are staying out of the house! Do yourself a favor also and measure from the floor up, so that none of it is dragging on the floor on when you apply it -

  Bought this less than one month ago and set up about 2 weeks ago. It was simple to set up but within a few hours two magnets fell off and the tape was no longer sticking to the door frame. The magnets containers are on the opposite sides ...and clamped together through the lining. When one walks through the door some of the magnet containers on the bottom of the mesh would come apart and fall to the floor. The bottom of the mesh got caught on something which caused a small hole. The previous mesh magnet door we had lasted for almost a year before showing signs of wear and tear; those magnets were sewn into the mesh door lining. Save your money, do your research,  and opt for something more durable.

  This mesh door went up very easily with the velcro strips. FYI, even though you might want to mount it so that it is taut, it closes better with just a bit of slack across the door. We did find it useful to add a couple extra velcro mounts. I thought it would be removable and while it would be easy to do, it does leave those velcro strips visible on the frame when not in use. If I were doing it again, I'd try to find white velcro strips to match the woodwork around the door. All this slightly negative things aside, I love the door and no longer worry about birds flying in when I leave the door open to allow air into the apartment. Flying insects have a less welcoming opening to visit as well. It is sturdy and as described. I would buy again.

  It says new and improved on the box but it's still the same old cr*p.  I had the screen up about 2 minutes, still affixing the sides and a magnet popped out of one of the middle plastic holders.  About 3 hours later another one of those plastic magnet holders was coming unsnapped and another magnet was working it's way out. They don't send enough velco, but that's the least of this product's problems. When it's assembled it leaves gaps in-between the Velcro closures and in the center between the magnets where tons of bugs can get in.  There also isn't enough weight on the bottom to keep it flush against the door frame so bugs can come in there too. Which really leaves no use for this product. And it isn't cheap! I decided instead of wasting more money on a replacement I'm just going to hire a handyman to install a screen that actually works.

  I ordered this because my children can't seem to figure out how to close the sliding door. I have four kids, and now that it is summer there is a pretty constant rotation coming in and out. This seemed like a possible fix to the issue, as it would keep the bugs out but make it possible for the kids to come and go without me needing to constantly remind them to shut the door.Functionally, this has been great so far for our family! It allows the kids and the dog to walk through easily, then the magnets ensure that it closes automatically. Installation was really simple, and the directions included are very clear. I removed the screen door from the sliding door and installed this on the outside of the door, and it is the perfect width and length. Between the magnets there are small gaps, but none big enough that we have had any bugs come in yet. It definitely simplifies summer play and removes my concerns about a gaping door,The only thing I haven't been thrilled with is that the mesh stitching is frayed in the center (where the magnets are located) making a constant supply of loose strings in the center of the door. I have been able to just pull them off without it seeming to detract from the effectiveness of the screen, but it causes a lot of drama when everyone thinks they have a spiderweb on their shoulder after walking through the door! Eventually I anticipate the door losing enough threads that it will start to cause issues with the structural integrity, but so far that hasn't been a problem and I have seven kids (my own and their friends), myself, and a dog that are using it constantly.

  Absolutely loved it. It was easy to put up. It's only been up like 4 hours and one of the magnets fell off. Not sure how long this is going to last. Great concept thoUpdate 24 hours later... 2 more magnets have fallen off. Time to return it and buy a better quality one.

  If chloramine (chlorine and ammonia) is used to disinfect your water supply, this filter will clog in a couple weeks according to the manufacturer. I was only told this because I noticed a defect in the casing and then they informed me. How many people purchased this based on their claims, and then threw it away once they lost water pressure, thinking only what the listing said, which is the life of filter will vary by how much chlorine you have. There is no mention Chloramine will significantly reduce the life of this filter and cause water pressure to be slowed down considerably.

  EDITED REVIEW: I only had a good experience with the first purchase. Subsequent purchases of filter replacements have not worked as well as the first one. The 3rd one I ordered only gave me a few days to a week of improved water. I’m not sure what the issue is, but I have since moved on to other brands.We moved from the country where we had a water softener to the city, where the water is both hard and heavily chlorinated. After three years, having super dry hair and itchy skin has become the new normal. My curly hair actually has straightened a lot and started falling out. I am also always breaking out in acne. After doing some research, I started to think maybe it was our water causing the problem. I noticed with our water that my hair instantly felt dry and gummy when the water hit it, even before using shampoo. Washing and conditioning never made it feel clean or soft, and it was always stringy and flat at the crown. My husband installed a $15 shower head filter from Menards, which we were using for awhile, but I wasn't impressed. On a whim, I thought I'd try the Aqua Bliss to see if it made any difference, or if I had to just give up and get used to gross hair and skin.And WOW!! The Aqua Bliss is awesome! I could tell a difference immediately! I don't remember when the last time was that my hair didn't feel like a bale of hay in the shower, even after conditioner. I'm not exaggerating one little bit. It's been awful. But one shower with the Aqua Bliss and my hair feels clean and soft, and has volume now. My skin doesn't feel stripped and itchy. I also didn't need to use anywhere near as much shower gel or shampoo. Amazing! I can't wait to see the improvements over time and if my acne goes away also. At this point, I'm converted, and will definitely repurchase!

  I love EVERYTHING about this company and their products! They give you exactly what they promise... a quality product and easy to understand directions.I just finished putting the filter on our showerhead. Earlier today I re-read the reviews and followed their directions. It was easy. No leaks.Earlier today I took the hose off the three way shower arm diverter. I soaked the shower arm diverter and the showerhead in undiluted vinegar all day. I cleaned up the threads on everything whether they needed it or not. I also soaked the washers and cute little screen things ...so they wouldn't feel left out.I almost forgot to put it all back together and add the filter!  I woke up, couldn't sleep and remembered ....So, even though I'm half awake, I just put it all together:1. The filter went on the extender2.The three way diverter is on the other end of filter3.The showerhead is attached to the three way diverter4. The hose is attached to the three way diverter.5. The handheld shower sprayer (also their product that I just received and love) is attached to the hose.I did this all in less than 10 minutes. NO LEAKS! I did not have to use any of the free tape they so thoughtfully provide.OH! I did not use any tools  .. not a one. I tightened everything by hand.I did take a shower to test the new filter. Yes, the water DOES feel different and my hair feels like silk. I did not need any lotion after my shower... plus, I am too tired to apply it anyhow.I'm going back to sleep now. I know my husband will enjoy his shower in an hour. No, I'm not Tom...  I am his wife.Buy this filter. I read a million reviews. My homework paid off.

  So I decided to test the before and after with a water tester.  The results were 262 ppm for water without the filter, and 249ppm for water with the filter.  No significant difference.  Still had chlorine in it, fluoride, and hard water.  I re-did the test to confirm.  Then I tested distilled water and got 0ppm, so the water tester was accurate.  In the end this shower filter literally doesn't do anything.

  I live in an area where they pump the water from a river with alot of farming in the catchment, its also volcanic soils & in summer gets salt water encroachment. So not ideal - it basically tastes and smells like a muddy puddle full of chlorine! After doing a bit of research as to why my hair felt so dry yet oil after washing, i decided the water may be playing a part. So i ordered the 12 stage water filter to try. One word - Amazing! I could actually feel a difference when showering, the water almost felt softer if possible & the chlorine smell was gone. After showering my skin didn't have that tight feeling, and my hair felt much softer. Greatly recommended!! FYI to fit our handheld shower, we just got a male/female hose extention from plumbing shop, so super easy install :-)

  I got this because we have an iron/scale problem when it comes to our hot water. we've been using this for a few weeks and I think that is fixed. My wife dyes her hair and its important to her that she has clean water and seems to do the trick. I can't comment on if the chlorine is removed or not because we have none in out well water.Our feels very lush now and we don't get that almost dry sticky feeling from hard water, nor do we get that super slipper feeling we got from water softeners. Its a great middle ground and make the water look, smell, and feel like nice old spring water. For the price, you're going be hard stretched to find anything comparable and doubt you'll find anything better. excellent product, and the owners are excellent people. they provide plenty of help if needed and customer service is a top priority. A++ from me!

  These were cute and worked as expected, however after about a week they started developing rust in many of the lights. They have not stopped working but after taking them down, I can see almost all of the lights are rusted. I was hoping to use them again next year but do not think it is a good idea to put them outside.The package says indoor/outdoor use but also says the plug must be kept indoors. Okkkkk... Then the safety instructions in the box say don’t close a door or window on the cord or extension cord you’re using to plug it in. So in reality these are only outdoor use if you can plug them inside and leave a door or window open while in operation. For a party or something it might work, but it’s more than a bit disingenuous to say these are waterproof, outdoor seasonal lights.It’s also being advertised hanging with curtains but the safety instructions explicitly say don’t do that. This is a cheap string of lights that might work just fine for you but buyer beware- the advertising on this listing is extremely misleading.

  I ordered four boxes of these for a wedding reception. The lights work fine. However, all four boxes had shards of glass in them upon opening. At first, I thought some of the bulbs had broken during shipping. Upon closer look, I realized the shards were much larger than the size of the bulbs, so I have no idea where they came from. As we pulled the lights out of the box, glass started falling everywhere onto the floor. This is so dangerous and I have no idea how this product could have passed any type of quality assurance test.

   These are so stunning I may just leave them up all year! I bought 3 strands and would honestly buy more if i needed them. I tested the waterproofing and they are definitely waterproof! I love all the different settings and the way they make my patio look. Just a heads up; do NOT take The twist ties off before you hang them up. I made the mistake of taking all the ties off and then had to untangle them for about half an hour lolBoth my mom and sister asked where I bought these lights so YES I would definitely refer these to others.

  DUDS!!!! Dang we are so disappointed! My son got these for his birthday and had to clean his room in order for me to help him hang them (incentive), well he put them under his bed in the box for awhile and by the time he finally got his room clean, we hung them and realized they don’t even work. So disappointed. As you can see they are still rolled up in the original way. Advice would be to test upon arrival and then don’t get your hopes up that they’ll last long.

  1- the width of this curtain is NOT 9 ft long, at least not the part with the actual lights.2- part of the cable is black rather than transparent so it’s an eyesore3- the “changing” part of the control doesn’t change anything so the lights are just stuck on flickering mode.This as my second set of these as the first arrived with only every other light working.

  When I received these lights, I had to untangle them. Most of it was not twist tied like the instructions say they should be. When plugging them in and turning them on, none of the lights turned on. There was also a whole other section of the lights that did not connect to the section with a plug. There are two ends that looked like they had been cut. (Photo attached) I wonder if someone had sent these back before and they just re-shipped it to someone else. I hope that is not the case. Luckily, I opened these within the return window. Such a disappointment though, I was super excited for these. :(

  This is the WORST dish soap we've ever purchased!  We usually use dish soap for cleaning one-off dishes we need right away or oversized items which don't easily fit in the dishwasher.  So instead of filling the sink with water and adding soap we'll wet a dish, put a drop of soap on it, suds, scrub and rinse.  The problem is this soap doesn't rinse off easily -- we've cleaned a large pot, rinsed for several minutes until we thought we had all the soap off it, made a large batch of pasta and when we rinsed the pasta, presto - suds reappeared in our pot of pasta!  We've had this happen several other times - make a bottle of milk for our baby, rinse several times and then go to add warm water and suds re-appear in the bottle!  While this product promises more suds for longer, it needs to rinse off dishes easier.

  We first saw that the bottles had been opened and retaped shut (which looked shady to begin with). We also noticed that the consistency of the soap looked really watery and it also looks like there's like 10% less soap in the bottle as usual (we buy the same soap/bottle size from the grocery store usually). We figure that the bottle probably has about 50-75% of the amount of soap as usual and then the rest is water to make the bottle look more full.That being said, still gave 3 stars because $12 for 4 bottles of soap is a legit steal

  I've  been cleaning dishes in some shape, form, or fashion now for almost 40 years.First: The likelihood that this item comes damaged to your home is relatively high. It will ship with other items that are potentially persihable, especially if you use subscribe & save.My wife shifted to using what could be salavaged from this soap instead of tossing it (we had to transfer it to a different container) and now, after every use, anything that it is used to clean transfers the taste of soap. A tumbler for coffee that I normally take to work tastes like I'm drinking soap. We've attempted to just rinse the tumbler multiple times and it still continues to add soapy flavor to any new drink added.Refrain from using on pots, pans, or bowls that you might use to cook or bake with. For St. Patrick's Day we made scones -- and despite properly cleaning the bowls and removing any and all residue -- the scones taste like giant bars of soap.The scent is generally unpleasant and permiates throughout your home or building when you use it. We do not live in a small space, but it can be noticed that dishes are soaking whenever this soap is used anywhere in the home.Just bleh.

  The dish washing detergent is fine. We've used it for years. On the other hand, Amazon's job of packaging the bottles was poor. The box arrived soaked in detergent, and one of the bottles was nearly empty because the flip cap was open. Packages are always jostled about in transit - this is unavoidable. It is Amazon's job to package containers holding liquids so that the contents is secure and padded. You can't just throw things into a box and hope for the best.

  ...due to all the phenomenal reviews all over the web, but mine are mixed. I have used many hoses over the years, so feel I have a bit of arm-chair knowledge. First, it is not totally a kink-free hose. It will kink at times just like a ""regular"" hose, but can easily be snapped out by a quick jerk. Not something you can easily do with a ""standard"" hose, but it does kink and cut the water off, for sure. Second, the description says it ""lays flat"" when not filled with water. Not true, it clearly doesn't. This wasn't a reason I purchased it, but clearly not as advertised. Third, it coils much harder then a ""standard"" hose. What I learned is that it needs to fully drained of water first, otherwise, it just creates a twisting effect that makes coiling it impossible. In fact, if it has these twists in it, the coil just ""figure-8's"" itself with you pick it up. I rarely, if ever, have that issue with a ""regular"" hose. All-in-all, mixed feelings I would say. If I purchased this without ever seeing a review, I might have given it 4 stars, but the internet hype is crazy, making it sound like it is a drastic hose revolution.

  I HATE this hose.  How this hose has any good reviews is simply beyond my comprehension.  I needed a long hose to reach the back of my yard where I have a pond.  This looked like a great idea for a lightweight flexible hose.  The only problem is this thing, once coiled up, is almost impossible to extend out without an extended wrestling match.  I kid you not, you will feel like you're wrestling a giant snake as you try to get the kinks out of this hose.  Unless you twist the hose as you unroll it, it will hold the loops and then kink at regular intervals.  This is an especially painful process with a 75' hose.  It has a nice feel to it, weighs almost nothing, but in my opinion is completely unusable if you plan of storing it coiled up in a holder/container of some sort.  I would only recommend if you plan on leaving it unrolled in your yard.

  I cannot tell you how much I HATE this hose. I saw the high rating and liked the color... it's a near match for the color of our front door. I'll pull the hose off the rack and walk around the house dropping it as I go. Part way to my destination the hose is spun up in a knot. I need to start unwinding it to get the kinks out. When I bring it back to wind it up on the rack it's the same thing... I spend more time unraveling this damn hose than using it to water! It's incredibly frustrating and I don't understand the high reviews.

  This is one of the worst hoses I've ever bought.  When you are trying to use it, it kinks and knots itself up and is a genuine pain in the butt.  Forget trying to coil it neatly.  Or at all.  If you have two people, one untwisting while the other coils, it's possible.  Otherwise it's totally impossible.  And when it is coiled nearly by two people, it rewards you by knotting up every few feet when you go to use it again.At least people walking down the dock get a laugh as they watch me fighting the damn thing.

  The first one had several kinks on arrival which seem like they are permanent, so I returned.  The second one was perfect, so we'll see how it holds up.  As of now, the hose seems good.  The only recommendation for user is to unwind completely before reeling/coiling back.  Annoying to do but necessary to reel/coil without inducing major kinks and twists in the hose.

   Method 1, the so called ""easy"" method did not work for any of my plugs.  It just would never recognize them.  So, I put them plug into AP mode, and it worked like a charm.  AP mode was pretty easy to use using the Smart Life app and I had no troubles.You have to create a  Smart Life account when you first install the app which is easy to do.  I have four plugs controlling Christmas lights around the house.  I created a group in the Smart Life app and put a timer on the group so that all my Christmas lights turn on at 4:30 and turn off at 10:30.  Very simple using the Smart Life app.I then enabled the Smart Life skill using my Alexa app and connected Alexa to my Smart Life account, so i can turn them on with voice commands also.  Alexa does not recognize the group name though.  She only sees the individual devices  So devices must be turned on one at a time using voice commands.  That's fine for now, because the only one I use voice commands for is the Christmas tree.  I was debating giving it four stars instead of five because the ""easy"" method didn't work and I had to use AP mode.  But, AP mode was pretty easy, and I do love that I can control everything with  Alexa, and the price was really good also.  So, I ended up with 5 stars.  Let's hope they last!

  Had no trouble connecting all four plugs to my wifi, then easily connected to my Alexa app. Great little gadgets for turning lights and fans on and off from another room. I've made groupings for lights and simmer pots, too. Important to understand that these plugs CAN NOT turn on a smart TV or other device which uses an infrared remote, but can turn them off. They turn off the electric current to the device, which means it has to be permanently ""turned on"" via a physical on/off button or switch. Unfortunately, this is not explained anywhere that I've seen.

  This 12 pack set of LED Fairy Lights have really impressed me. I do a lot of crafts using lights like these, but I usually get them from a different site. I thought using the other site, but I was so wrong. Not only are these lights I purchased here on Amazon less expensive, but they are also a much better quality of lights. They do arrive in a nice box with batteries included as well as a little screwdriver to get to the battery compartment. They each have the plastic to keep the batteries from draining before you are ready to use them. These fairy lights put it a beautiful warm lighting that adds the perfect touch to any project. These would be great for wedding decorations as well. I will be buying more for my next round of craft projects and you should too!

   I LOVE these fairy lights for my Christmas gifts.  I made little Christmas trees and these lights were absolutely perfect for the trees.  I even put the a few sets of lights in a vase with Christmas balls.  It’s so pretty!I used 1 set of lights per tree and it was perfect!

  Some of the other reviews mentioned lights not working...I found a few however they all eventually worked. There were 2 lights where the little plastic battery cover was pushed back far and I had to open the device to access it and 1 required a little ""whack"" (like you do when the tv remote won't work). All and all, these lights are an incredible value, the brightness worked perfectly in a glass vase with water and colored beads. The lights are waterproof, but the battery pack is not (although, I accidentally dropped the whole thing in water,  they still worked fine). I will definitely purchase again should fairy lights be needed.

  These tiny fairy lights are subtle in small quantities. The tree on the left only has 3 strands. It looks elegant, unlike the other one which looks playful. There is a little issue with the battery boxes.  They don’t seem to close tightly enough and I had to squeeze them to get the lights to operate. After the first time I had no more problems. I would definitely buy again.

  I bought these so I could put them around my gaming setup, but I'm still waiting on my desk but I had to break one of them out and do something with it so I put it along my closet curtain. They're neatly packaged, and also come with the tiniest screwdriver I've ever seen as well as 3 extra battery replacements. Each string of lights comes with a battery already installed and the wire is wrapped up in a fairly organized way.Be careful undoing the loops on the lights, it's not just a few twists this way and a twist that way. The wires have two sides to them and in between them are the bulbs, and they've fed the wire between itself around in a couple different ways. Not hard to undo at all, just note that you can't twist it off like a bread tie and stretch it out. Take your time.My only gripe is along the start of the wire there's such a big gap where there are no lights. I didn't realize this at first as you can see in my 4th picture, I'd already fed them down through my curtain hanger and taped it to the wall to keep it still and realized there were no lights for a good 7 inches or so, so I had to redo it and wrap it up and tuck away behind the switch. Although, this is a good thing in a way because it gives you plenty of room to tuck the switch and battery pack away out of sight.Some of the lights do seem a little more ""cold"" than others. I ordered warm lights, but a few of them still seem to be a little more on the whiter side than the yellowish tint, but I don't really mind it. The wire is easy to bend and holds its shape, and is easy to straighten back out again if you need to adjust or move it.Overall great lights, and I'll probably be ordering more of them.

  This came packed SO WELL!!! And with extra batteries!!! Here's some advice and addressing any bad reviews:1) It comes with a tab so the battery isn't drained. KEEP THE TABS!2) Be patient unraveling the strings. Pay attention!! If you look and take them apart carefully, it will be so much better!!3) I placed these on my stairway garland. It looks AMAZING!!!4) When placing them, use the starting point with NO remote...string along...then start the NEXT strand with the remote so that 2 are close together. This helps so you aren't hunting to turn them on.5) Sit back and look at how pretty they look!Don't be a Grinch and blame other factors. It was packaged perfectly with NO breakage. Every light was strong.

  I adore these and would recommend them. With that said, there are a few things to note.One of mine didn't work straight out of the package. They were packaged well and so I believe this was wired incorrectly.The lights dim before they go out. You'd think this was helpful but you can see some dim and others are still bright. So, if you are putting them in a display with more than one strand you might have to replace them all when one goes. You can see this in my photo.Replacing the batteries is a bit of a pain. The package comes with the cutest little screwdriver. Think doll cute. Actually, it is great if your child has an 18"" doll. Thankfully I had a slightly larger screw driver in the house. The screws are equally tiny and I now have a few hiding in my house as I dropped them and could not find them. (I don't have kids nor pets so this isn't a problem. I simply gave up trying to put the screws back in after changing the batteries and used clear tape to hold the new batteries in place once I put the cover back on.Still, worth the price. My batteries only lasted maybe 5 or 6 nights of being used about 4-6 hours. Next year I will time this better so I am not replacing batteries right before Christmas. But, they are great for places that don't have outlets. I hope this helps :)Oh- It does come with extra batteries. I actually upgraded to a higher priced battery in hopes of it staying on a bit longer.

  If you're looking at this review then you probably have a nice vacuum.  You're probably wondering, how do I replace these bags?  You're probably looking at these bags and thinking, man these are kind of expensive for.. well..  bags.  You would be right. These are kind of really expensive.  These bags are fine bags, they do everything they need to, but they're also really really expensive.  Sure they come with air filters too, but you're not going to go through the air filters fast enough to need to replace them with each bag.  Just kind of feels wasteful.So now you're probably wondering, but what choice do I have?  I have this nice vacuum, they kind of have me don't they?  No they do not.  Generics exist that sell bags that will work in your vacuum for a mere fraction of the price.  A simple amazon search will even bring you to some of these generic and it turns out they work just as well.  Having tried these official bags and the generics I can say, these bags are over priced and the premium does not result in any added benefit.Save yourself money and buy the generics.

  These bags are not made for the US market, they are made for European markets, they are made by Miele but they have a different internal baffling system than bags made for the US market.  They will work in US vacuums but perhaps not as efficiently,  Miele recommends using the correct bags for US made machines.  The description is misleading and should state these bags are not made for the USA market.

  I've owned a Miele for a few years, and while it sounds crazy to sing the praises of a vacuum cleaner, I must.  I originally got it because I was sick of the jet-engine, ear-piercing sound of cheaper canister vacs - I love how quiet it is.  Over the years I am continually amazed at how stuffed the bag can get with no reduction in suction - believe it or not (because I've never had the bag-change warning light go off either), I get reminded to change the bag because I sense the vacuum is heavier than normal !  When I do, the bag is always so stuffed it is hard to remove - yet it can be removed without emitting any dust or debris,or tearing, like paper bags. AND, as I said, it still has great suction in such a state.All in all, just a fantastic piece of engineering - albeit a pricey one.I bought a Miele dishwasher because I was so impressed with the vacuum, and that has been a joy as well.  Essentially silent, and cleans everything much better than its predecessors - I never even knew how much cleaner and spot-free things could be (I'm in NYC with great water supply - no need to use its built-in salt water softening feature).  And it's an 18"" model, to fit my apartment.  Holds an amazing amount.

  I didn’t buy these for my vacuum. I don’t even have a vacuum that takes bags. BUT I bought them to cut up and use for  filters for my corona virus masks. These are very soft and not like those stiff vacuum bags. 4 in a box should get me at least 4 filters per bag for a total of 16 filters. Stay safe everyone!

  A lot of people have complained that they received the other (the ""Hyclean"" European version) bags, so I was a little worried about getting the wrong product (""Airclean is the proper American version).  However, they came exactly as advertised and they fit my C1 Limited Edition vacuum perfectly.  They are of better quality than the 3rd party bags I had been using, so I'm very happy with my purchase.

  Just ordered these for our C3 Complete model. They are identical to the one that came with the model. Perfect fit and original. I have also shown the filter that came with it ( you have to cut it to the correct size for your model) but ours looks clean as shown in the picture so I didn’t change it. Also seems to have another filter that our model doesn’t use. I have also taken a picture of ours HEPA filter ( not included in this package) that is also very clean, a testament to how well the original bag (and this replacement by definition) work at capturing the dust and small dust/dirt particles.

  These are great bags. Yes, the box is redesigned. Yes, the bags are slightly redesigned. Same performance. They may be expensive, but half the reason I have a Miele is for the filtration and bagging system. If you are simply restocking, these are the same as the ""other"" GN airclean bags, just a bit redesigned. They work just the same.

  I always read reviews, but rarely write them. I felt compelled to write one for O'Keefe's Healthy feet as this is the real dead. I usually let my feet be handled by professionals - i.e. pedicures, but I recently had a baby and couldn't find the time to go for the better part of a year. I walk around barefoot all the time and almost always wear shoes without socks - flats, heels, flip flops, etc. Needless to say without the bi-monthly pedicures and the love I should be showing my piggies, the neglect I've given my feet made them look like they've seen better days. Honestly, I would get embarrassed by the heels of my feet because they were so dry and hard and starting to crack. I purchased a pumice stone and went to town on these monsters with little to no help long term.I saw a commercial for the O'Keefe's hand cream and was intrigued enough to check them out and saw that they also made a foot cream. I figured it was no harm, no foul and ordered it.It felt really nice on my feet. Not greasy and I felt like it really penetrated the skin. I TRIED to use it once or twice a day, but mostly just remembered right before I was going to sleep. And let me tell - after 1 WEEK - WOW!!! There was a major difference. I did help the process along with one or two sessions with that pumice stone, but mainly it was the cream and a pair of cotton socks at night that really helped my feet turn around.And then after 3 weeks ... I couldn't believe the difference. The cracks were repairing and the awful dryness was gone! My feet feel soft and CLEAN. (you know how dry skin makes everything look dirty!!!)I'm going to continue to use this everyday - as long as I remember - and no longer be embarrassed by my troll like heels again! And maybe, just maybe I'll find time to get a pedicure and they'll be all ""wow you're feet are so soft!!!!"" Thanks O'Keefe's!!!Picture is before, after 1 week and after 3 weeks.

  This stuff is amazing. Seriously. My feet have been cracked non-stop for probably the last 10 years. I've tried literally everything- Pedicures, Ped-egg, Gold Bond foot cream, lotion every night with socks on, pumice stones, that ridiculous mouthwash/shaving cream home ""remedy""...I was just about to buy a foot chemical peel when I saw this and figured I'd give it a shot before spending $25 and having 2 weeks of peely feet. I'm 32 years old and was incredibly embarrassed by my feet.After the first week of using it nightly (no socks) I was still a bit skeptical because there was a slight improvement, but not much.The second week I was like okay, we're getting there...The third I was like THANK GOD! Something has finally worked!After 4+ weeks my feet have never been better. They are still a little surface dry, probably because I only use it at night, but there are ZERO cracks in them. I haven't used a pumice stone or gone to get a pedicure since I started using it, so my results are only because of the lotion. I do scrub them down every other week or so with a buffer just to keep them soft.My only complaint is that the lotion is thick, so I don't like the way it feels on my hands, but I expected that given that it's for cracked heels and less creamy lotions won't work as well.Overall, I couldn't recommend this more. I know I sound like an infomercial, but I can honestly say this is worth every penny. One jar used once a day will last you probably about a month and you can buy it at bed bath and beyond for $6.99.

  Love this stuff! Been living with cracked feet for YEARS! Stuff is a miracle!Tips:1. Instead of wearing a sock which I find absorbs the cream (a waste in my opinion) - wear a silicone heel protector for 15 to 30 minutes after applying. The silicone will hold in the moisture in instead of absorbing it.This is will allow your foot to absorb the cream fully. I fully believe the reason my feet healed so fast was because I used silicone heel pads with the cream.2. Do not apply this cream and expect to be walking around anytime soon after. It is a very greasy formula (that’s a good thing for your foot!) - I put it on right before bed and read a bit while it works. I take the silicone protectors off and go to bed immediately after.3. It tingles a bit but I didn’t find it overly annoying. I used it once a day only at bedtime.  I saw results the morning after.

  I wouldn't blame you if you threw up a little looking at the before and after pics. I'm 30 years old and thought to myself ""my good feet days are in the past "". I'm originally from Miami so it's almost 365 days of flip flops or open toe shoes. I tried EVERY lotion, special Dr. Prescription moisturizing lotion, even at home foot scrubs and soaks, overnight foot wraps. NOTHING WORKED! So fed up, I always go on Amazon to read reviews and see what other people have tried. I came across this lotion. Figured what is there to loose but less than $10. So I tried it. From DAY ONE, it soothed my Crack heels. My heels were so badly cracked it hurt to walk. I honestly don't know how my feet got to this point...I even purchased a pumice stone, the ""as seen on tv ped egg"". Nothing works as good, and as FAST AS this lotion. I am so happy I feel like writting a letter to the company telling them I am SUCH A HAPPY CAMPER! No more being shy, embarrassed how my feet look. I'm telling you, my feet were in such bad shape that even after scrubbing with HOT WATER, SOAP AND the pumice stone...my heels still looked dirty because the cracks were so deep. My 10 year old kid said ""Mom, did you wash your feet""? Super embarrasing. Now I go to my Yoga class barefoot no embarrassment. I can go to the beach with my nice looking feet and of course wear my sandals with confidence.  THANK YOU AMAZON for speedy delivery and thank you O'Keeffe's for developing and marketing such a WONDERFUL PRODUCT. I will forever be great full and always recommend this to family and friends!! :-D

The lights bulbs are a great size and provide the perfect outdoor patio lighting.  The light strings can be added together for as much lighting as you need.

  Had been looking to get some stringed like such as these for a while and all the ones I found in stores looked cheaped and did not offer the true Edison look I was hoping for. I order one strand of these and when I got them in and realized the quality I quickly ordered a second. Above each light is a hole which you can use to hang with nails which is super useful instead of a cheap clip. I use mine inside and plan on ordering several more this summer when I look to add some outside.

  I bought a 24’ string from Harbor Freight Tools while shopping out of town. When I put them up I found I really liked them and wanted to purchase more. I looked in local stores but they were twice the price. I found this 48ft string the price was cheaper than any others anywhere (online or in stores). I’ve put them up with the 24ft string to run the perimeter of my patio. They are perfect!!  I used cup hooks, or hooks with screw ends, to hang them. The only problem I had was with the lightbulbs. When I moved the box the bottom came open (it isn’t secured shut) and I lost the 3 extra bulbs to the concrete patio floor. :(  Glad extra came with the purchase.  Maybe in the future the company could secure the top and bottom of the box with tape.

   I really, really, really want a planetarium projector with more than just a rotating disk so until that day comes I'm willing to satisfy my need and budget with this light show, and a worthy light show it is.  This is the best drunk Amazon purchase I've made hands down.  The laser stars and rotating nebula make me wish I lived in a THC friendly state.  I've had it for a few months now and have no complaints. The stars and nebula are bright. It shuts down after 4 hours and doesn't seem to make any noise like I've read in another review. So far, so good.  Totally worth the investment if like a trippy light show for your living area.

  I’m totally addicted to this thing. If I’m going to spend a significant amount of time in a room I’ll bring it with me. It’s great for really anything, even watching tv or enjoying a magical bath. It’s quite beautiful and relaxing.It’s easy to use and small, my only complaint in the placement of the buttons: whenever I pick up the unit or try to adjust it, I inevitably push one and have to figure out which one it was and then cycle through them again to get to where I was. And, this has become more minor as time goes on, I do wish the stars were blue or white instead of green. Some of the seller’s images make them look more along this spectrum, but, it’s still enjoyable. For the price this can’t be beaten, I’m seriously tempted to get one for every room.Pro tip: try placing candles or other warm, soft light near the wall and center the projector on it. Creates some very pretty magenta and purple colors, and it looks even more like a nebula.

  when I received it I was so happy to give it to my son , when I plugged it in it got power for a few seconds then went off. Like most I took it out the box and plugged it in without reading the instructions so I thought that was the issue. No it was just that the power cord was loose, no it was that the power cord was too pushed in ... I made so many excuses because I wanted it to work. this thing is not even worth a dollar at this point because it comes on when it wants too and it works when it wants too. I recommend passing on this one . I really wanted it to work. Amazon is sending me a replacement , this thing better work out the box or else I want a full refund . My sons party went off without a hitch , but he really wanted this as well and it bombed.update the replacement worked for a whole day , tried it out guess what ... trash !

  After having difficulty with different brands of smart plugs in the past, I was wary about buying ones online again, but I decided to trust the great reviews this product had. I'm so glad I did! The setup literally took minutes, and was so easy.The 5-Minute Setup:- Download the ""Kasa"" app- Tapped the ""+"" button in the top right corner to add a new smart plug and then tapped on ""Smart Plug""- Found the model of my smart plug on the bottom of the plug itself (these are model HS103) and selected the right model- Plugged the smart plug into the wall and went through the 1-minute easy setup on the screen- Opened my Google Home app to see a newly-added banner at the top that said ""add tp-link"" so I clicked on that- Selected all three of the new lamps I had set up- Asked Google to turn off one of the lamps and -BAM- just like that, the lamp turned off!Tips:- Instead of choosing a random icon for your smart plug, please take a picture of the device it will be controlling. Trust me, this will come in handy later.- Select nicknames that are unique and distinct, like proper names. My lamps are named Kirk, Eddie, and Olive. Weird? Yeah. But there's a method to this madness: the Google Assistant has difficulty interpreting my request to turn off my bedroom lamp, or to turn on my bedside lamp, when I have three lamps in one room. Having names like Eddie or Kirk help Google get the right lamp, every time. Plus, it's easier for you to remember that the lamp on your nightstand is called ""Brian"" instead of ""Bedroom Lamp #1.""Do I recommend this product:- Hell yes. Now I can live the lazy fantasy of my dreams, sans complicated setups or weird technical errors. Ah, to be lazy in the age of technology.That is all.

  I have a detached shed which is over 40 feet from  where my router is.  The shed is 20 feet long and the florescent light is at the very back.  So I bought one of these to be able to turn on the shed light if I'm in the house or as I enter the shed where I have an echo dot plugged in.  Sure enough, Kasa mini plug works like a charm.  It's so nice not to have to go into a dark shed and fumble for the pull chain.  When my hubby comes in at night from fishing, I can turn on the shed light for him while I'm in the house watching tv.  I have these scattered all over the house.  In the basement, bedrooms, living room, kitchen....... anywhere you have a lamp with a cord.  I know they make them for wall switches too.  I wish I could use it with my Keurig, but you still have to push a button on the Keurig to activate the brewing..... so that won't work.  But if you had an old style coffee percolator and an echo in your bedroom, you can ask it to turn on before you get out of bed in the morning or even set it to come on and go off every day at a set time.  All these units can be set to operate on a schedule or even cause your lights to go on randomly if you're on vacation.  You can also remotely operate one or your lights from your cell phone or IPad.  I used one with a small table fan in my bedroom this summer.  If I got too cold at night, I didn't have to get up to turn it off.  I just said... Echo, Fan OFF......and vice versa......if I got too hot, all I had to say was Echo, Fan on.I've use these for over a year now, with not a single problem from any of the 10 units I have.  Very easy to set up. I'm a 70 yr old gal and if I can do it.........you can too.  Be sure you set up using a 2G network...last I knew it doesn't work on 5G

  I bought a bunch of these to replace a slew of Belkin WeMo's that were absolutely horrible. They never worked consistently. The Kasa switches are much more reliable and have great so far.One major complaint is that you cannot program an offset time for sundown or sunrise. For example, I have my landscape lighting set to turn on at sundown. But I have a lot of trees that block the sun late in the day, so I would like the lights to turn on 30 minutes before sundown. The WeMo's had that ability — to set for sundown -30 minutes. Since sundown changes a little bit every day, the switch would always activate 30 minutes before actual sundown.The Kasa app does not have that ability. You either set it by sundown - which is too late for me - or you manually set it. But if you set it manually, then every week you have to be making adjustments. Major pain because I need this feature on about half of my switches.Kasa, please add this functionality to the app. It cannot be that difficult, really. Do that and I would immediately change my review to 5 stars.

  I made the mistake of buying a cheaper 4 pack.  They did not integrate with Alexa at all.  These have always worked with no hitches at all.  I have a quirky printer, so I plugged into one of these and at 3am it turns off and on to reboot itself so it's ready for work that day.  I have my living room lights and bedroom light on it.  I tell Alexa I'm ready for bed and the bedroom turns on, the loving room turns off and she tells me to rest well.  And when I'm out of town that randomly turn lights and a radio on and off.  I'll never buy another brand.

  I should have second guessed myself when I saw a 4-pack for this price.  I guess the panic of prime day makes you not read as well.  On he full version of the plugs, they clearly lable 15A capable.  But on this page, not a single reference to amperage rating.  Which of course means they are not 15A capable but rather ""less than 12 amps"".  Which isn't terrible for a single lamp, fan, decoration.  But if you thought you'd use it for any device you use on a 15A circuit, you would be wrong and burn up this ""Lite"" model.  I love TP-Link Kasa stuff, I have tons of lights and sockets and 6-port power strips, I think they make great stuff.  I just really really have come to despise Amazon and their incomplete or mixed up descriptions of products.  Does it say ""lite"" up in the main part of the page?  Nope, only once, way down in the specs section.  So this item gets 1-star for being deceptive.  FYI HS105 is the 15A product, HS103 is the 12A.  P1-P2-P4 is the multi-packs.

  We are way past the baby proofing stage but we purchased a deeply discounted refrigerator from one of the box hardware stores. It was deeply discounted because someone bought it, requested to have the door open the opposite way which required the store to remove the hinges and install them on the other side of the fridge.  We bought it as a second fridge for our large 5 person (3 teens) family to keep in garage.  Long story short the door to the freezer and fridge would fall open all the time.  Someone would walk by it and it would pop open.  So I bought these straps to add  a 'latch' to each of the doors.  They were easy to install and are easy to open.  No more problems with finding the doors open and fridge in defrost mode.  I'm a little concerned how long the adhesive will work but so far they are rock solid.  ON a humorous note, I had to show 2 of the teens how to open the latches (I'm thinking it's more due to laziness on their part because the latches pop open easily when done right).  So if two teens can't open them I'm guessing it should keep a toddler from getting into trouble for a little while.

   Pros: They do the job and they're easily adjustable. We've only had them on a week, but they have stayed on well in areas we use frequently thus far.Cons: Compared to other brands and style of locks I've used, they're not the smoothest/easiest to open one handed, especially in a hurry. After using these, I prefer the ""pinch"" style locks. You have to apply light pressure to slide it out to the unlocked position, but then you must simultaneously pull out to unlatch from the base and the small amount of plastic there is to grab/hook your finger on isn't much (see pictures and video.)I've used 2 of the 4 in the box I got. Will I use those when the time comes? Yes. Would I buy these again? No.

  Every time my 18 month old was suddenly quiet and not in my direct sight I would come to find her happily loading up our toilet with toilet paper. I found this product on Amazon and purchased it given the good reviews and price. I’m happy to say it was super easy to install and easy for adults to quickly unlatch. I found given the shape of my toilet I had to place the latch in the front. If you can place yours more on the side that would be ideal so the strap won’t be hanging between your legs while you are using the toilet. Oh and most importantly- I’ve won this battle with my toddler. Is it wrong to laugh at a baby as they try to open the toilet lid? :)

  I actually got these to secure my washer and dryer from my son's 8 month old 90 lb German Sherpard puppy. He stays in the laundry room when we aren't home and he's so smart he figured out how to open the pedestals. He was destroying the toilet paper, paper towels, light bulbs, grocery bags, etc...that I store in there. Since installing these, he can't open the pedestals! (I do have 1 on each side because it didnt seem as secure with just having 1 in the middle- as he is really strong). These keep him out, but are also easy enough for me to unlatch when I need into the pedestal drawer.

  The product itself did not work for what I purchased it for. I bought them to secure our toilet lids because our toddler keeps flushing things down the toilet. The adhesive did not stick to the bowl itself. The company, “Joel Baby” emailed me about my satisfaction with the product and I explained this to them. They were very helpful and ended up refunding me as they did not have a substitute available. Great customer service and even though the product didn’t work for me, I would definitely purchase from the company again. As for the product itself, I imagine they would work great on cabinets or a refrigerator. The adhesive just didn’t work well with the porcelain on the toilet bowl.

  A friend of mine who uses this on his RV fridge recommended it.  We bought this for our refrigerator in the garage, the freezer door of which sometimes popped open.  That's bad news when you have frozen expensive meat and the temp in the garage is over 100 degrees.  It worked absolutely perfectly!

  In general, this is a great surge protector with the bonus of having 2 USB charging ports included.  Two major downsides for me are:  (1) The casing is not designed to fit flush against the wall, leaving a visible gap around the edges of the surge protector between it and the wall, and (2) The surge protector  is designed to fit over both electrical outlet plugs in a standard outlet, but the surge protector only plugs into the receptacle of one outlet and then has a small plastic nub that fits into the bottom outlet rather than plugging into both and utilizing the electrical connections of both outlets.  I have an older model that plugs into both outlets and fits flush against the wall, making it much sturdier, cosmetically smooth and seamless, and half of the expansion outlets in the older model are powered by each of the two outlets in the receptacle rather than all of them being powered by (and anchored into) just one of the wall receptacle plugs.Although the surge protector bolts into the wall socket/receptacle, the fact that it is not flush to the wall combined with not being plugged fully into both outlets of the wall receptacle leaves it slightly loose, and you must be extra careful unplugging appliances from the surge protector.  I place one hand against the surge protector cover to hold it firmly in place while I unplug the cord(s) I want to disconnect.  Having an older model that plugs into both outlets and bolts flush to the wall set a great standard that I have not been able to find again.  Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but I know this surge protector COULD be better if designed to improve the two mentioned weaknesses.  Otherwise, I like it enough that I purchased two more for other locations where family members often vie for access to charge their electronic devices, or where they kept unplugging lamps, landline phones, and other stationary electrical devices to charge their phones or tablets.  These provide many more outlets in the same location and the capability to plug in USB cords directly instead of bulky adapters, and no one has a good excuse to unplug the lamps, alarm clock, or landline telephone charger.

  Reading through the reviews here, it seems as if Amazon has merged reviews for two different products from the same manufacturer.  I have several of both products shown in the photos.  I read some folks complain about the product not being snugly affixed to a wall outlet.  We do not have that problem.  As shown in photo #1, there is no space between the surge protector and the wall socket.  We affixed the unit to the outlet using the long screw provided.  BUT, you should note how these things work.  This is attached, via that screw, to the wall outlet, and the wall outlet needs to be affixed firmly to the electrical box in which it resides.  If you take off the wall outlet cover and there is play in the outlet itself, tighten it.  Then place the cover and the surge protector over the outlet and affix the long screw through both into the outlet.  The more firmly seated the outlet in the box, the firmer the surge protector and outlet cover plate will be.The other product is shown in photo #2.  I purchased this product specifically because it only uses one, not two, plugs.  As you can see in the last photo, this single gang outlet is on our kitchen island counter side, and so I needed an extension device to provide more outlets than the single plug.  This device does NOT have a screw to affix it to the outlet behind it, so yes you have to be careful in unplugging devices from it else you can pull it out of the outlet.  On the flip side of the coin, this surge protector is rotatable so you can rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise to have the surge protector horizonal, and you can even rotate it a full 180 degrees so that it is vertical with the USB ports facing down toward the floor.  Why would anyone want to do this?  If those USB ports are not in use, you can accumulate dust if they are facing UP.Each of these surge protectors work well and have their benefits and drawbacks.  So before you select one, know how you will be using it, where you will be using it, and then make your decision on which to purchase.  The first one is nice for counter uses - the photo shows one in our bathroom adjacent to the makeup vanity.  The cell phone sits on top in the holder quite nicely.  The second surge protector works well in our kitchen island counter - we have one on either end of the counter - and we purchased an additional one that we keep in our travel pack for when we get to the hotel and find they don't have sufficient outlets.

  How well this functions as a surge protector, we have not verified.  But the combination of MOV, TVS, and GDT should handle surges quite well.As other reviewers have written, this thing can be quite loose and downright wobbly if not anchored properly.Best way to secure this thing to a standard duplex outlet?  First remove the center screw that holds the strike plate (cover) over the outlet.  Do not discard the strike plate.  place the strike plate under the surge protector, keeping everything in line with the long screw that comes with the surge protector.  Then carefully plug the surge protector into the outlets, without letting the strike plate slip, and screw everything together.  The surge protector will wobble a bit but it will stay in place.I only tried the vertical orientation this was designed for.  I do not know how well it would hold in horizontal orientation.

  This review is for my purchase of Chamberlain myQ-G0401 - Wireless Smart Garage Hub in White color:Background:I have tried a couple of brands with my Chamberlain garage door opener unit and for the most part none have been perfect.I am very versed in technology and have over 70 automated (IOT) devices at home and easily installed.I have a VERY strong internet connection and a Mesh internet router setup where 100% of my house has 100% full bar connectivity - no dead zones at all for any of my devices. Well till I bought this unit...This unit:I decided to purchase and give this newer 2020 version a try. The hope is for consistent operation.Issue to date:The install should be a cake. Follow the in app instructions and all should be done as easy as 1, 2, 3.Well... so I hoped.For me all worked fine except when the unit tried to connect to my WiFi, it showed it as weak signal (1 bar). All my other units have full 3-4 bars.I even took the unit and put it next to one of my routers and then it showed 2 bars. Still weak connection.So... after much try and moving the unit close and moving one of my routers to garage next to this unit, then it now works.But for most of you who unlike me do not have a $1000 wireless network mesh, and even then not wanting to move one of the routers to the garage next to this unit, then forget about buying this awful product.Simply, the radio signal receiver is just bad.I can not stress this more, ALL my other units on my network have a 100% connectivity bar except for this unit.For me after some 1 hour of frustration, it now works (so far), and the only (it’s major) issue was trying to connect to the internet.Update - after several months of utilization:The device continues to be connected to wifi (read above), however, the device and its separate door sensor (tells the unit door is open or closed), often lose connectivity and thus falsely notifies me during the day or middle of night that my garage door is now open. It freaked me out several times when I was away or on vacation.Worse... you think the door is open so you click the app button to close it, just to then realize in the evening upon return to home that you opened the garage door vs. closing it due to the unit misread. I’ve been bugging the neighbors to check if door is open or closed every time this thing falsely triggers.Lastly, there’s a cool feature you can turn on in the app that can close your garage door if the door is left open greater than xx minutes or after a special hour (like 10 pm). Well.. do not use it because in my case due to weak sensor and misread, in the middle of the night it would open the garage door by itself thinking it’s past 10 and the door is left open.I have disabled it now and thinking of unplugging the entire unit. It’s just more risk than reward.Best of luck.

  First off, I have friends with this unit that are happy with the quality and functionality. My experience with Chamberlain and this product were not as good.You should know if your garage door unit is not new (as in the last few years), you may encounter some issues with setup.My house was built in 2002, and the opener is original. The Chamberlain website notes compatibility with the Genie Excelerator, says ""you may need a garage door opener to finish setup."" Cool. I have that. No problem.I get everything setup, unit on the ceiling, monitor on the door. Everything is going great. The unit simply will not find my garage door motor. I've tried every which way. At times, it will randomly open and close during setup. But eventually the setup pukes out and directs me to customer service.This is where having this product goes in the garbage.I attempt to call Customer Service. They're on the west coast and closed for the day. No problem. I will email them. I get an immediate bounceback saying they will get back to me in two days. Four days later, I email them asking if they can address my issue. Two days later, they email some generic garbage instructing me to reset the device. Oh thanks!You may have good success with this. I did not. And I'm tech savvy. If your opener is more than a few years old, though, proceed with caution...or at least save the packaging so you can return the product like I am.If this was helpful, please hit the button.

  Well, after numerous hours and a week of headaches I finally figured out the hubs issues.  (1). Make sure you use the full length of the power cord, if you are plugging it in the same outlet as your garage door motor.  (2). Mount the hub as far away as you can from all lighting and motors (ie garage door motor).  (3). Have a good WiFi connection.  (4). Mount the garage door sensor on the same side of the garage that you mount the hub.  (5). Learn how to reset the hub, which is done by using the center “settings” button.  You may have to start from the beginning of the myQ app several times to connect to the WiFi, to pair the door sensor, and to pair the garage door opener to the hub.  And be prepared to spackle, sand and paint all the holes you may have made from trying to mount the hub in various locations.  No subscription is needed if you are just using the myQ app or the factory garage door remotes.  Bottom line:  it works!  Instructions could have been better, but it is finally installed and it works, and it was only $25.

  In a word, No. don’t even think about purchasing this garage hub. Easy to install but it loses signal constantly and is worthless without Wi-Fi. Rebooting the unit it will regain signal for 10 minutes before dropping it again. My router is literally 20 feet away, cell phone shows plenty of signal, WiFiSweetSpot also shows plenty, in a house where everything else connects without any issue (inside or out in the garage), the MyQ doesn’t. Just for fun, I even plugged in a Wi-Fi extender in the garage, rebooted everything and had exact same issues. Find another option, but I’m disappointed in my purchase, and will be sending back.EDIT: I'm changing this to a 2-star review but I did get it to work on my own. To get it to work, I followed the advice of someone on Youtube who suggested adding the MyQ device separately on a guest wifi network (he suggested a 2.4Ghz-only connection, I don't have that ability, so I set up a 2.4/5.0Ghz guest network and rebooted the hub and reset the wifi connection to the new network and it works for now). That fixed the issue for me and it does now work;, however, I never would have known that just using the instructions given by the manufacturer. I'm not sure why the MyQ device can't share the channel with other devices, but if you can set it up on a guest login by itself, you may have better luck. Hoping this will help someone else!

  Overall, Command hooks are one of the most amazing recent inventions. They really do hold their designated weight well, are easy to use, and come off the surface leaving no marks.I got these hooks for various small hanging tasks, among which are lightweight pictures. They will work for such, though the instructions that came with them insist they shouldn't be used with pictures, at all. I'm not sure what difference it makes in the long run.One thing that was annoying is these hooks are the anti-fancy. They are plain, to the point of being best used in service spaces. They will always be visible above whatever you use them for.Also, if you use them for something that you will often remove from the hook, such as keys, the hook isn't stationary. It' isn't attached to the wall in any way--only the white base is. So every time you lift something off the hook the hook lifts too, creating a bit of a tangle to get the thing off the hook. I'd rather the hooks be fully adhered to the base and not move.Also, I did not receive the correct number of hooks and adhesives in my box. I only received 14 hooks. I would get Command hooks again, though not from this vendor, and not this style.

  These failed in every way. I tried to hang a couple of SMALL canvas paintings -- 14x14. They weighed maybe a pound? As you can see from the photo, they ripped the paint off the wall when I tried to remove and reposition them. Then, the one that hadn't been removed just fell off, and my painting went crashing to the ground. Just... useless. I don't know. Maybe they aren't supposed to be used to hang canvas paintings? Don't know what else they would be for. They're just too small and delicate, and the adhesive is too weak. I prefer the Velcro-based picture-hanging Command strips. They haven't let me down. I'm returning these.

  We used it to hang the faux ivy and lights at our DIY shower. It was a low lit room, so wanted to add lighting without literally adding a lamp on the floor. These things worked great and didn’t damage my in-laws walls. We also used them to hang up other decor including the balloon cluster above the food table (pic before food was set out). Would definitely purchase again for everyday hanging around our house.

  I've had the drill for almost two years, and generally it's been pretty good. Good enough that I have repurchased the drill.Bad enough that it's literally shooting flames out the back when using it now, so I had to repurchase it -- as it's clearly unsafe to use if it's on fire.I have no idea if it's still under warranty, and there's no obvious way to contact Dewalt.update: I was in contact back/forth with Dewalt for nearly a month. They asked for proof of purchase, and I sent that to them. Then provided me with a free label to ship them the drill. After they had the drill, they then told me it's no longer under warranty, but fortunately for them they now have any evidence of a class action lawsuit about their drills catching fire in their possession. They offered to ""repair"" it for nearly full cost of the drill. I'm not sure why they couldn't have simply told me they were wasting my time immediately after sending them my proof of purchase which is when they would have known the warranty was no longer valid.

For consistent pick up and use I got about a good 4 solid hours before she needed to change the battery ( That is undo a bolts, put down, line up new shackles thread on new bolts and then use dewalt to set them and lock them down).PROS:Lightweight, Great Price, Good Power (will lock on bolts super tight), Nice bag, quick charging timesCONS:States 12v with 20v Max - Not a true 20v, The LED light on the Impact drill is located under the bit, makes it hard to see what you are doing above it to line something up..Overall - For the price and what you get, I couldn't be happier! It helped me get the job done and will be using it for other jobs as well!

  My old 18volt out lasted and had more power, drill last about 10 minutes when drilling batteries don't last half as long as my old 18v dealt a, very unsatisfied, only reason I bought it was couldn't find an 18v setup to replace mine that broke, in the middle of a job so had to have something, looking at makita my father in law has them and had to borrow his the last couple days so I could get the job completed. Not happy at all. Called the help line and the person pretty much treated me as if I was an idiot. Did you charge the battery. Absolutley no help at all. Tried to ask about returning it or refund she had no clue, tried calling dewalt and got no where. Going to try and return it, also smells like its burning up. Both units

  Have many Dewalt tools and like the products.  Before purchasing saw a U Tube review that said SOME of the drills in this kit have a problem with the bits falling out of the drill chuck when the trigger is released.  So tested drill upon arrival and sure enough the bits kept falling out-the drill stops VERY fast and twists in your hand from torque.  Spoke to customer service  and without any problem from them sent it out-prepaid- for repair.  Got it back with same problem.  Now am sending to different service center (want it fixed and did not request a refund)  for replacement with a tested drill.  BTW, the impact driver and batteries in kit work great.  Company told me if drill does not work properly upon return, they will give me full refundUPDATE:  Sent drill to 2 service centers and couldn't seem to fix it.  Dewalt upgraded to better drill and gave me 2 new batteries and a charger at no charge  U should be aware that service tech stated that this is a ""consumer"" drill as compared to their more professional drill kits for more money.  That said, there is an expectation that it will work upon arrival.

  Don't bother with thinking you'll save some money by buying some low budget 18-Volt tools...  The 20 Volt DeWalt tools are like having a NASCAR, and everything else is just a Prius...  Bought this set for my 23 yr old Grandson.  Me, I build Movie Sets (for over 35 years), and I'm frequently on Location out in the middle of nowhere; so I have a full collection for myself. Note:  20 Volt DeWalt is the ONLY Brand you'll ever see on a Film Crew Set.

  Fan of dewalt but this set didn't cut it sparks flying out the back and a kick when you let off trigger . Just pay a little more and go brushless smoother and no sparks . I work around flmaables at times and this definitely what you don't want is sparks flying out the breather vents

  Disappointing entry from Dewalt.  I bought this to replace the older set I had and the lighter lithium batteries looked appealing.  Problem is, these things don't last.  I would get hours of use out of my old set.  For a big project I could go all day on one battery.  These last less than an hour on a full charge.  Very disappointing.  Every project takes twice as long because we have to keep charging the batteries.Two stars because when its fully charged, the tools work fine.  If you're looking for something to hang a set of curtains or a picture on the wall, this will work fine.  If you are somebody that uses your tools frequently, look elsewhere.

  I work in real estate and we used this lockbox for years until recently when we were unable to open one with the combo we had on file. It was a mystery to us, indeed. We were about to cut it off the fence, when I had an idea to google ways to open this lock box if you forgot the combo. My search IMMEDIATELY returned several YouTube videos on how to pick this lock. All you need is a thin piece of metal. (It's pictured at the bottom of the photo attached to this review.) Just for fun, I tried. People...I AM A SECRETARY with no experience picking locks. I was able to pick both of our MasterLock lockboxes in under 3 minutes. And both combinations did not match what we had on file. I think they had already been picked and the combos changed, as the working numbers did not follow our standard combo formula. DO NOT BUY THIS LOCKBOX! It is NOT secure. If I can pick this lock, anyone can. Here's the link to the video I only had to watch twice before becoming an expert on picking this MasterLock lockbox. [...]

  Bought the lock. Put on a sturdy pipe, put key inside, closed & locked box. A few short weeks later, and hey, the darn thing has been peeled like a banana!!! Needless to say, changing my door lock cost me $112. The problem is with the dust/weather cover. If you punch it out, there is a nice gap where a prying tool can be inserted. Wham, no more locked, secure house/apartment key.  Poor design!!! NEVER buy this lock!!!!

  Absolutely do not use this for keys that secure anything of value, especially your home! There are videos of how to easily pick this lock available online and it can happen to you.I cannot stress this enough. Last night we awoke to an intruder in our home who had cut this off our main gate and opened it (likely following the easily googled how-to videos), using the keys inside to enter our home.Luckily no one was hurt, but trust me that you never want to experience that situation yourself. Find another solution if you're looking to store your house keys for use by others, preferably one that the entire Internet doesn't know how to open!

  Do not buy!!I bought this lock to keep my car key safe while I surf. I put my key in the lock and attach it my truck.  On my second use of this lock, I put in my combination, opened the lock, put my key in the chamber, and closed the lock.  An hour later, I tried to open the lock, and my combination would not work.  After 20 minutes, I had to call a lock smith to open the lock for me.  He mentioned that this are horrible locks because they are easy to crack and he went on to show me.  He first tried to crack it by feeling the combination.  There are multiple videos on how to do this on Youtube.  Once this did not work, he told me that the locking mechanism is missed aligned, and with in 5-7 seconds forced the unlocking lever down and pried open the door.  I am not kidding you, 5-7 seconds... I was left with my mouth open because he only used two very basic tools that i also own.  He smiled and said Yes it is that easy this locks are very easy to open ""Do not use it"". He did tell me that the locks where you have to punch in the combination are much much harder to crack.  He then continue to charge me 110 dollars that were very well deserved.Lessons learned.1. This lock will break at times leaving your valuables unaccessible.2. It will cost you at a minimun 110 dollars (I did called several to select the lowest priced)3. This lock is very easy to crack. Just search on google... too easy...DO NOT BUY!!!!

  Works well and seems rugged. I use it to keep an extra set of house keys outside when needed.  It looks securely onto my sliding glass door handle.Update 4/2017:  This hung on my back door for 5 months.  Not a soul ever touched it.  As with any locks, including those on your front door, anything can be broken into if someone wants to.  So as far as how secure this is goes, well how secure is your door even?  How much in your area is someone likely to try to break it open?  Those are all factors that go into whether or not this lock is ""safe"".  I am using it now at my Dad's house so that when necessary a caregiver can call me for the code and go into the house. This has saved me twice this week from having to turn around on my way to work and open a door for someone.  The code gets change after I give it out, and at times I can just remove the lock if I choose.  This beats the alternatives.  If someone wants into your home, they will get in anyway whether you have a key box out or not.

  I have been searching for a good oil to treat my butcher block countertop. After reading so many reviews on Amazon for different oils, I decided to give this one a try. I removed everything from my countertops and follow the instructions (I left it for 24hrs). I decided to apply the oil with my hands  (gloves on). I also put it on my acacia tea box and salt container. The following day I wiped it off with a towel.Looking at my stainless steel stove, fridge, and other surfaces in my kitchen I wanted to see how this oil will also work to revive it. I used the same towel and WOW, I couldn’t believe my eyes! Everything looks brand new.After years of wiping my counters and appliances clean with other daily cleaning products, this oil has brought everything back to life!This will be a staple in my kitchen. A little bit goes a long way.  I cannot believe I waited this long to try it!

  I purchased this mineral oil for two primary purposes.  The first was to protect my high carbon knives.  There are a lot of products that will do this, but many are not food safe.  In other applications, that might not be an issue, but I tend to use my knives in a variety of ways, including food prep, especially when I'm camping.  It's reassuring to know that I haven't coated my blade with something potentially dangerous.  As far as inhibiting rust, time will tell, but I have no reason to doubt this will do the job.The second reason I bought this was to oil my wooden cutting boards.  I'd previously used olive oil, but it has a tendency to go rancid, so I don't use it as often as I should.  Still, I'd thought my cutting boards were in pretty good shape until I treated the first one with this product.  I was pretty amazed at what a difference it made.  Plus, it imparted absolutely no smell that I could detect.  I'll definitely be oiling them more often now.My only complaint is that the bottle was pretty badly crushed in transit so that it doesn't even stand up.  I will no doubt have a major spill at some point because of this.  That is probably the fault of the packer or the shipper, though, and has no bearing on the quality of the product.

  I have a nice thick butcher-block style cutting board my dad made for me that was getting extremely dry (I probably hadn't oiled it in more than eight months...) but I lost my old board oil in a move. This stuff seemed to get good reviews on Amazon so I threw it in my cart, and I like it a lot better than the oil I had been using previously! My old stuff was pretty thick, meant to be wiped on with a rag. This stuff is thinner, more like vegetable oil (although slightly more viscous than that). Just gave my board a liberal squirt and spread it around and let sit overnight. Repeated the process the next day on the other side of my board and now it looks brand new!I also like that the bottle is more on the ""minimalist"" side (although that's a silly thing to make a purchase decision on), it just honestly *looks* nicer than other brands I was considering.

  Unfortunately, I had been neglecting my butcher block island.  I found this Food Grade Mineral Oil and applied a generous coat - I was amazed at how it brought the island back to life.  I gives a lovely coat to the island and the fact that it is food grade is imperative.  It went on easily and looks remarkable.  As I mentioned, it truly brought the island back to life.  I got two bottles so I could more regularly maintain my block!  Thank you for producing such a fabulous oil!!

  As a woodworker, I am always in search of the best oil finishes I can find, and I have tried plenty of them! Typically, I make hardwood furniture and use several coats of hand rubbed Pure Tung Oil; it creates a satin finish that shows off the wood's grain beautifully, and leaves the wood still looking like natural wood.  Occasionally, I make smaller items for gifts for my family and friends. In this photo is a Curly Maple cutting board I made for friends for Christmas. I have tried many cutting board finishes, and although they may hold up well, they don't seem to do justice to the beauty of the wood's grain, especially when it is highly figured.  I couldn't be more pleased with how this food grade mineral oil highlighted the beauty of the grain; close up it truly looks 3D! It has a thinner viscosity than most of the food grade products I've tried, I applied probably 7-8 thick coats to each side of the board, one after another, and all were rubbed in with my fingers! The wood just kept soaking it up, which surprised me since I sanded the Curly Maple up to 400 grit. When the wood seemed saturated and the oil ""sat on top"" in several areas on both sides, I let in soak in for an hour and buffed it with a soft cloth. It needs to soak in and dry for a day or two before use. It's best to simply wipe a board clean with a damp sponge and as little detergent as possible.I gave my friends a small container of this oil for reconditioning, in case, down the road, dry spots appear.I can't attest yet to how it holds up, but I will check in with my friends and give an update in the future. It is such a beautiful finish, I am almost tempted to try it on a small table to see how it holds up, and use additional coats of it like a furniture polish to maintain the finish, but cost effectiveness might be a concern with larger pieces. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

  I rated scent a 5 because I couldn’t tell that it had a scent. So far I’ve used it on 2 stainless steel sinks and on a new quartz countertop. As reviews have said, a little goes a long way. It made the sinks look great but to my surprise it made the new quartz top look great also. On the quartz it made the colors more vivid with a glossy look. I’d certainly recommend this and will buy again.The more I use this mineral oil, the more I like it. I’d include it with vinegar and duck tape as a household essential.

It took me OVER TWO GALLONS OF WATER, running the reservoir dry several times, to get the disgusting chemical smell and residue out of the brewer.  Thank God I didn’t try to drink a cup of coffe, as the directions said would be clean, after one “clean” cup!!Since the cleaning, I have had several malfunctions, from short cups (3-4 ounces when on 10 ounce setting) to complete stoppages that required needle cleaning.

The spacing is very convenient for my laptop to have room next to the TV plug, amd now I can extend it and reach the hdmi port at the same time.

  At just over $20, this is a no-brainer. For the same price, companies like GE try to sell you a 6 outlet with a fat plug and 2nd rate internals.

  I really liked this product for the versatility of the AC outlets and USB outlets.  Seems well made and I really like the flat surface on the AC outlet strip.  Needed to replace my old power strip to get ready for cord cutting to occur in this household.The only fault I would note is that it has the traditional straight plug where I prefer a flat ac plug.  Remedied easily enough by cutting existing plug off and added my own flat plug procured here on Amazon.  Would have been nicer and cheaper if it came on the power strip cord.  I would have even paid a bit more if it had the flat ac plug feature. A flat plug would have earned the 5 star for versatility.I'll update if performance is an issue.

  I really like this power board.  I did a lot of research before I bought this.  Read all the comments and make sure this meets my needs.  I have different shapes of charging cords that need them in different ways.  This applies to those types.  There is enough space between the plugs to be able to rotate the items in different ways and still safely install them.  There are four USB ports on the end that can be used when needed without the need for a plug.  Will come back soon to buy more of this project.  Highly recommended.

  There are several terrific elements to this power strip. First, two of the outlets are placed in such a way that the large boxy power adapter plugs at the end of many electronic devices can be plugged in without compromising the outlet immediately next to it. This means a lot to me, since I have Google Nest prongs to plug in along with other large adapter plugs. In a ten outlet strip I can actually use all ten outlets! Woo-hoo! Second, the unit still manages to be compact. It is also surprisingly sturdy while maintaining a low profile. It's the perfect power strip for my home video setup.

  I had to google differences between KN95 and N9 masks - KN95 are similar to N95 masks, but made in China.  These appear to be high quality with good manufacture quality.  The metal strip around the nose is robust and makes a good seal over the nose bridge (one of my biggest peeves with cheap masks).  The cone is also super helpful to keep the mask material from sucking into your nose and mouth during inhalation.  Ear loops are snug, but not as tight as I'm used to for some other N95 masks.  Can't comment on whether these are as effective as real N95s, but they definitely seem subjectively much more effective than regular surgical or procedural masks (as they should).  Looks like on the CDC website these have received approval for FDA-EUA.

A really great price/value for 50 masks, and much better protection than surgical masks.. I leave a few in the car and the rest at home. This will last us a very long time.

  You get 2 sealed packs of 25 masks. They seem thick enough to be effective, and the bendable nose piece allows it to conform to most shapes.The ear loop elastic was a bit too tight for my liking, so I don’t think I’d want to wear it all day, but given the price they seem good for short use.

  These masks have helped me a lot at work. I'm able to speak much more clearly with the extra space it provides (even while wearing a face shield). I can also see amount of air it filters by putting my mask on securely and breathing in and out. The mask will slightly shrink and expand when breathing. This masks is also acceptable at my work where I would have to wear two masks instead of just this one. Wearing two masks and a face shield can make it very hard to speak and be understood. Other than the strings on the sides not being the strongest, this is a perfect buy. Caution. Don't pull perpendicular to the attachment of the ear holding strings. They will come off with enough force.

  These masks fit great and are easy to breath with when worn. When going out in public I much prefer a cloth face mask that's re-usable, but opted to test these out since they were black and looked comfortable. While they're super breathable, I think I will add these to my collection of tools in the garage and use them when I paint or do wood working projects. The masks are disposable and are more suited for one time use applications, so I feel more comfortable using them for such projects.They work really well for wood dust, especially when cutting and sanding wood. For small jobs I can typically go without wearing a dust mask and be okay, but I've had an irritated sinus or throat afterwards on larger jobs where I was too lazy to grab a mask or didn't have one handy. Wearing these I had zero issues after a ton of sanding one day, so I highly recommend them.

  I'm a teacher and use these for up to 3 and half hours at a time. Very comfortable while staying tight on my face. Slightly odd smell right after opening (nothing more than what would be expected), but it goes away quickly after letting the bag of masks air out.Highly recommend

  What started us on this purchase was my wife overhearing a conversation at a medical center near us.  Another client was relating how her daughter worked for a hotel whose owner wanted his maids to not change the sheets from previous customers and just leave them on the bed for the next arrivals if they didn't look too dirty.  This shocked my wife, and her physical therapist told her that this little device was what she took along to inspect hotel and motel rooms before she decided to stay, or possibly to move to another room if the situation warranted.  It truly is shocking what you will find in a room that your naked eye never sees.  If you thought you were a fabulous housekeeper, guess again.  If you think ANY motel or hotel in which you have stayed is really clean, guess again.  Maids even in the best of places hit only the surface.  We also recommend taking along sanitary wipes and anti-bacterial spray and hitting the toilet before using, the light fixtures, the tv remote, etc.  If you think that ignorance is bliss, you will not want to get this light.  Yet, if you think that protecting yourself against possible messes and negligent and irresponsible hotel owners and lazy maids is wise, I would urge you to own one.  In motel rooms, we have found stuff splattered on walls that could not be seen.  We have found that most bed covers have a lot of dust, and the dust ruffles on beds are often quite dirty.  Tubs that looked normal to the eye were often exposed in older hotels as having lost much of their enamel.  Stains are found in virtually every motel room.  Do we stay in flea bags when we travel?  No!!  We don't stay in the most expensive places normally, but we stay in hotels which have high customer ratings and avoid the ones with low customer ratings.  We check under all the mattresses for bed bugs to make sure we don't take those little critters home with us.  That alone is worth the price.  I believe that ignorance is not bliss, especially when it comes to following other folks that we do not know into a living space they have occupied.  We are NOT germaphobes, but then again, taking precautions is not a foolish thing either.  Is this little gem worth the small price you will pay?  ABSOLUTELY.

  Was a little leery due to some negative reviews.  My sister bought one when she got a puppy and recommended it.  It works well, and what it reveals is disturbing but helpful.I use Nature’s Miracle in the red not white bottles (which I highly recommend) to clean up canine messes. I could tell which spots I missed, which ones I treated well (coz I couldn’t find them and I know the pup peed there), and which spots I didn’t spray a big enough area.  There would be big clear spot in the middle and faint borders where I didn’t spray enough on the edges.Use it in the dark. It’s like the lights in the indoor glow in the dark golf places.  It’ll highlight other things like miscellaneous fuzz or little particles on the carpet.  So you may want to vacuum first or you may see psychedelic little particles everywhere.  My finger and toe nails all glowed in the dark too.I pointed the flashlight pretty much straight down and would sweep back forth for thoroughness.  It also illuminated other weird spills which left a trail as though someone was walking while spilling something (hopefully not tinkling while walking around).  Spots I missed (so didn’t treat with Natures Miracle) really glowed brightly.  Ones I should treat again were much fainter.  I found disturbing spots where someone peed on the baseboard and the post for the stairs. (Maybe the previous owner’s dog since they were rather low to the ground.)Buy it.  Hope you don’t get too grossed out.

  These are VERY nice masks. With five layers of protection and a soft, skin friendly material, I can wear these masks comfortably for extended periods. They fit my nose and cheeks well and though they could be a bit longer, they do cover my chin securely as long as I maintain the length of my beard. I REALLY like the ear loops on this product. They are  securely anchored and this is the first mask I've purchase in quite a while that doesn't require loop extenders or cord locks for a secure fit. Yes...this product does come individually wrapped in a nicely sealed sleeve. But in these troubled time I'm very fussy about what I put on my face. Every mask that comes into my home (reguardless of the point of origin) is throughly cleansed in my UV-C sanitizer and stored, prior  to use, in a labeled zip lock bag. I've bought a lot of masks in the past ten months or so. This product easily ranks in the top two for quality, comfort, and overall  satisfaction. These are real nice, reasonably priced masks, that I highly recommend.

  Let's start off by acknowledging the pure money grab when it comes to PPE.  And like all other merchants we are being charged the price pre pandemic of a genuine 3M N95 mask.  I purchased these masks mainly because they are black.  However you better have a smaller face because I don't think it seals around the face on most consumers.  It fits like its sized not like a fit all sized mask.  Since I haven't used steroids ever, I dont think my head as grown, but I'm still going to have to get a different brand.  I'm pretty familiar with different mask types and how they should fit, and this can be used with kids of smaller faced adults.  The seal breaks whenever I talk or even smile.

  I wanted a kn95 due to the increase in covid.  When I got it I was surprised that some parts of the mask imprint looks transparent, see picture.  Out of concern I tested the mask with water, and the mask was able to hold water without leaks.  So that seems good.The breathing wasn't too hard, and it feels fairly comfortable.  Although I feel the mask should be slightly tighter to prevent air leak somewhere.  I suppose people can tie small knots on the string to make it shorter and therefore tighter to ensure a better seal.  However this probably will also make it slightly harder to breathe.  So weight your needs carefully.All kn95 masks on the market seems to folded in half out of the box.  Note that will make the metal nose stripe more likely to fold in v shape when you put on.  But your nose top is u shaped.  So you probably want to unfold the metal flat and refold  slightly to the side to make a u shape molding to better fit your nose.

  Some people said there is a gap and I don’t find that to be true. The edges don’t seal but I drew yellow lines where it is actually making contact around my mouth and nose about an inch from the edge. There are no air gaps and thats all I cared about. Much better than my other disposable and cloth masks. The wire on the nose adjusted easily and the ear loops are soft. I’ll update if I encounter any issues

  After a few days of use, I think this kn95 mask is more comfortable than the one I used before. First of all, I like the color of the mask very much. Black can make my face thinner visually. Secondly, the quality of this mask is no problem. It's very comfortable, and it's very suitable for the whole face. I wrap my nose and mouth tightly, but it doesn't hinder my breathing. My breathing is still very smooth, and I don't feel suffocated. The texture and comfort of this mask are worth using. I also recommend this mask to my classmates and friends. Under the test of such a severe epidemic, everyone should wear masks to protect the safety and health of individuals and others.

  The size of the tarp is smaller than advertised on the product label and website descriptionI bought the 9 by 12 tarp to wall off an area that is 11-feet-4 inches wide and 7-feet-10 inches tall. I started securing the tarp at the top corner, about 3 inches from the actual edge of the space, expecting to have another 3-5 inches of slack on the other side. Nope. It didn't reach the other side.So I tried again, this time starting right on the edge of the space. This time, it *barely* made it to the other side, and I had to leave some extra slack in the rope on that side, leaving a noticeable gap in the enclosure. The height made it down to the floor, but definitely not with an extra 14 inches of slack as it should have. It was maybe 4 inches.They advertise a 9 by 12 tarp, but sell you a tarp that is barely more than 11 by 8. They should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of honestly and/or geometry skills.

  I purchased this expecting a really, really cheap tarp.I was therefore actually pretty surprised at how truly crappy this one was.The grommets were only half installed, not aligned with the actual hole in the tarp, or completely missing.One corner was folded back on itself and stuck together - when I tried to straighten it, it ripped, leaving a hole.I think you could probably choose about any other tarp randomly on Amazon and it would be better.

  I do not believe I have ever seen tarp this thin and I have bought and used 20+ over time for various tasks.  It feels more like a plastic rather than tarp. It leaked water the very first day and doesn't seem it will last long. I am just disappointing about how rigged Amazon review system is (there is no way this many positive reviews are authentic for this product and I wasted so much time and money on this.I am only guessing that the calculation on this is that even if 1 out of 5 buyers keeps the tarp, they still make profit since it costs them probably around $2 to make these in China. then, if the return rate gets too high, they just switch the name. These people are despicable for offering this type of garbage and Amazon needs to figure out how the system is rigged (they probably will not since they also profit from this sale; or this could even be their own brand).Attached are the pictures to see the how light goes through and how purely woven it is. Even the aluminum grommets look extremely cheap and uneven.

  This tarp arrived ripped. It was the 8x10 as ordered but it wasn't 8 feet nor was it 10' - much shorter on both sides. I was trying to cover sandboxes and the measurements mattered. It says it is 5 mil thick, but it feels so very thin - thinner than the 5 mil tarps (also blue, laminated, tight 8x8 weave) that we got from Home Depot. At first I was pleased with the weight but it's not worth your time or money -- ripped, not too size, and flimsy. Avoid this horrible tarp.

  I purchased this Fluidmaster Toilet Fill Valve Kit to replace the original fill valve that came with my toilet (14 years old).  I had previously replaced the flapper a few times, but this time the entire fill valve was shot (Noisy, leaking & running).  My water bill was running about $5 higher than normal, so this new fill valve will pay for itself in less than 2 MONTHS!The install was extremely easy; taking only about 15 minutes.  The included directions are easy to follow; no tools are necessary unless the existing lock-nut that is under the toilet is a bit seized.  Before installing or removing any parts, turn off your water pressure at the toilet and flush your toilet to remove as much water as possible from the tank.  Any remaining water can be soaked up and removed with a sponge.  I always get a small bowl, or use an old towel under the toilet to capture any other small amounts of water once I remove the nut that holds the valve stem.  The new valve kit and flapper easily attached to the flush arm and fill pipe.  This is a very inexpensive and straight forward DIY project.Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews.  I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.

  Lasted about 6 months before the valve started leaking, Verified flapper seats properly. Then replaced it anyway.Tried inspecting, cleaning and flushing the valve seat as per the video. No help. Runs slowly but continuously through  the 1/8"" plastic refill tube. Then I discovered the following:If the plastic refill tube length extends down lower into the pipe than the full water level, this will create a siphon effect that will make water flow slowly through the refill tube and create the impression of a leaky valve.Do NOT reuse the existing refill tube, even if it appears to be OK. Use the supplied refill tube AND supplied mounting clip, and trim the tube length if needed. This will ensure that the refill tube doesn't siphon the tank and make the valve open. Look in the bowl and ensure that you don't see any water flow.I thin the valve design should prevent this, but it does not.

  What a huge relief finally no more leaky toilets around the house. Install took about 20 minutes including the removal of the old valve system, key thing to remember is to make sure you have teflon tape to seal the water line make sure the float mechanism has clearance to go up and down smoothly. I would recommend just testing the system before you put everything back together.

  I bought this to replace a fill valve that was dripping into the tank.  Our home was built 11 years ago and we've lived here for 9 years.This replacement was easy to install and seems like it does a reasonably good job of filling the tank and cutting off flow properly.  I do have a gripe with it, though.  At the top of the fill valve there is a filter to prevent small bits of debris from passing through the valve.  The problem I've had - three times now - is that when those tiny bits of debris are caught by the filter it locks the valve open and the water continually runs.The only way I have found to correct this problem is to pull the top of the tank, unscrew the valve assembly, use a knife or pick to remove the contaminant and then reassemble the valve.  Not difficult, but not something I've ever had to do with previous fill valves in this house for the past 9 years.  Having to do it three times in the two and a half months since installing this valve is less than ideal.

  First off, Amazon has the picture wrong on this. The 400CR is the newer version with the screw type float height adjuster..always, whereas the 400C can be the old (bar and clip adjuster) or new version because Fluidmaster reverted back to using just 400C some time after the design revision. I knew this when I ordered, but for those of you who care, there it is. I've had both the old and new and just prefer the newer design personally, but plumbers don't seem to care either way. They both function exactly the same way.This is by far the best designed, easiest to install and configure, and reliable fill valve available. I've installed it in each of my toilets over the years. It fills fast, fairly quietly and doesn't cause pipe hammer.I finally had to replace one (the older design) because it repeatedly started having issues. I'd had it in the toilet for at least 10 years anyway! First it started running, which was easily fixed with a cap flushing, but then water stopped flowing to the fill tube. The clog was down in the fill valve below the cap and did not stay fixed with a flushing, so I just decided to replace it. They only take a few minutes to replace and the cost is nominal.The flapper that comes with it is of good quality but I haven't used it. It can be installad on round or square fill tubes that have flapper posts on them. (A post ring for fill tube is not included. Looks like the picture of the black part of the flapper is wrong too. It does not have a fill tube ring. It is open ended just with hooks)My one toilet has a flapper with the timing cup on top of it and it's own drain seat insert that it's attached to (555CRP8, also made by Fluidmaster, 555C is the newest version) because the fill tube is too far from the drain and a standard offset on the flapper, as this has, wouldn't center and seal properly.The other toilet still has a firm gray one with a notched plastic ""chain"" that I installed separately years ago too. If they aint broke, I don't replace them! Flappers are the touchy part.In addition, fluidmaster provides excellent instructions for the DIYers like me, both in the package and on their website, including troubleshooting instructions. Top notch professional company.Highly recommended.

  I have purchased/installed/used two of these shower heads. I would highly recommend them to anyone that is interested.BACKSTORY:I'm currently renting a new place and I found myself really missing the shower head with a hose from my old home. However, since I'm renting, I didn't want to spend a lot of fixtures. Since this one has a decent price and good reviews, I bought one for my bathroom. Within two days, everyone in the house was fighting over the shower with this in it. I ended up buying a second one within a week. Here is what I noticed:PROS:- It looks nice (nicer than I expected for the price).- It came with clear/easy instructions for installation.- The installation was a breeze. It took maybe 3 minutes and didn't require a single tool.- I was worried I might not have enough water pressure for this to work well, but that was not the case. It works very well regardless of the setting. In fact, on some of the settings it actually seems to amplify the water pressure.- It is very easy to get the shower head in/out of the mount.- It is easy to change the settings.- Although it's not pictured, I was able to put my hanging shower caddy back up and the hose/mount doesn't interfere at all.- After about two weeks of multiple uses daily, it is holding up great.CONS:- I'm really stretching to find a con on this one. The only thing that comes to mind is that when I opened the box and picked it up for the first time, I noticed that it was made of a pretty lightweight plastic.  That made me question whether it was going to be a quality product. After using it the first time, that concern was relieved right away. This is every bit as good as the more expensive ones I've purchased in the past.UPDATE:After 4 months of daily use, both of these are still holding up great. We still love them as much as we did the first day.

  I purchased two of these shower heads. Initially, my wife and I were very happy with the look and function of this product. However, after ONE time of using the detachable shower head the hose began to leak. Thinking it was likely a defective product, we decided to order another one of these. This time, we decided to avoid using the detachable shower head to avoid any potential mishaps. Sure enough, a couple months later after ONE time using the detachable shower head, the hose AGAIN began leaking.Terrible quality, go to Costco and buy a shower head there for the same price and better quality.

  I got this item in a lightning deal for $15.  First of all,  assembly took 5 minutes.  Secondly,  remove the entire flow restrictor from the inside of the base of the handle.  This item works much better with a strong flow of water.  For some reason,  they have to put them in items like this,  it's perfectly normal to remove the water flow restrictor.  Hand tighten!!!!!!!  Do not use any tools!!!!!!!  The only tool you need is needle nose pliers to pull out all three parts of the flow restrictor.  Mine rocks.  No drips,  absolute quality hose and handle.  Very impressive highly polished gleaming chrome finish.  I love it.  Something of this quality at any brick and mortar store would be at least $40.  Amazon,  Thanx for the lightning deal!!!!!!!!!!!  What a bargain!!!!!!!Jack

   I was so excited to use this spot cleaner for small areas in my bedroom showing stains.  I didn't need a whole house steam cleaning system, I only had three small areas in my bedroom (I blame the kids or the cats, maybe both), that I needed to touch up, and based on the reviews, this seemed like the machine to do it. Initially, I had nothing but positive things to say about this product, the ease of use, assembly, portability, etc, until the results were in, and this machine did not remove the stains in my carpet.  Here are the details:WHAT I LIKED:-Assembly.  It was easy - just a few hose attachments to snap on, and your product is assembled, took less than 10 minutes.-Included items.  I liked that this product came with a 3-inch tough stain remover brush and a deep cleaning tool.  It also came with an 8 fl oz trial size Oxy spot and stain formula ready mixed for out of the box cleaning.-Lightweight.  I was able to haul this machine up and down stairs even with the water tank filled, no problem.  It weighed about 10 pounds, with the water.-When I emptied the water after cleaning the small stained areas (approximately 3 inches in diameter on my carpet)  water was filthy - I was pleased that it looked like it had cleaned something....however, read below.THE DEALBREAKERS:-It didn't get the spots out of my carpet.  They may be fainter, but they are not gone, and this is even with me pre-treating the spots and following the Bissell instructions to the letter.  Yes, the water was dirty, so I'm sure it did something, but I was expecting the spot (which was just grime, not nail polish or anything permanent) to be easily removed.  I've honestly had better luck using a spray bottle of Resolve carpet cleaner for less hassle than breaking this thing out.-Short hose.  15ft.  I was definitely on my hands and knees using this machine.  Not convenient perhaps for those who don't want to or can't crawl around on their floor.-Heatwave technology is advertised to maintain consistent water temperature while cleaning.  Let's just say the water was consistently tepid to cold throughout the cleaning and should be more aptly named Coldwave Technology.  Perhaps the lack of any water temp is why the spots wouldn't lift.-Spray nozzle.  The cleaning heads contains a spray trigger so you can spray the solution while you use the scrubbing tool. The spray didn't really go where I pointed it, and it ended well outside the area I wanted to clean.  It also soaked the carpet, taking 24 hours to dry these areas completely.-Dirty water tank hard to empty with one small drain plug.Disappointed that a name I've long associated with cleaning (Bissell) could make a product that frankly fails to live up to the basic job it was created to do - spot treat a carpet and lift dirt.  I'll be renting a whole house carpet cleaner instead.

  This portable cleaner is easy to use, and the suction power seems average, but it does not heat the water.  It is supposed to retain the temperature of the water you put in it, but it doesn't.  Hot water goes in, cold water comes out.  It also leaks water when you remove the clean and dirty water reservoirs.  Listen to the reviews that say don't waste your money.  I didn't, and now I'm two days past the date I can return it for a refund.  Don't be like me!  Just don't buy it.

  My dog decided that her new place to have accidents was going to be in my new couch. At first I bought some pet store products that would help with removing stains and odor. They kind of worked, not really. Then I decided to try “home remedies” with baking soda and basically ruined my couch. My next step was to call a professional...they quoted me $250-$350. So I did a little bit of research and watched some YouTube videos and discovered this amazing guy for a fraction of the price and figured I’d probably be needing it again in the future when my dog decides she mad at me and wants to let me know. 2 days later it was at my house and I was so excited to use it (I’m getting old). I followed the instructions, pretreated the stains and holy bissell was I amazed. This thing crushesI’ve recommended it to everyone at work with a pet. Super easy to use, smells good and it’s small and portable.

  This unit consists of a spray nozzle and a vacuum. Any of the 'cleaning' is done by the chemicals and any elbow grease you apply. The plastic doesn't seem that durable so you should not be too rough in handling it. That said its compact, has nice aesthetic design, and also offers a self-cleaning attachment nozzle to clear out the hose of any debris.If you need something basic to clean some small stains then this should work out. If you're looking to do a thorough cleaning of a rug or furniture you should probably spend some more money and get a more powerful unit.

  I thought I can actually get a steam cleaner for under $400 and expect it to be good...But I'm pretty sure the only thing this machine did was make my rugs wet.Why I returned it:- Very short hose (like most people said) makes it awkward to maneuver.- imprecise spraying from tool Does indeed make more of a wet mess than it helps to spot treat.- water runs out too fast, which means the cleaning liquid does too.- the cleaning liquid did no cleaning: I had a few very light stains from cat vomit that were mostly gone from earlier attempts to spot treat and blot off, but I have light carpets and wanted a more thorough clean; this did nothing to achieve that.- Isn't the water supposed to heat up? It doesn't!

  Don’t buy this. I usually buy the green machine but went with this model and it was a mistake. This is terrible. Doesn’t heat the water although it’s called a pro heat. Poor suction leaves everything sopping wet and only pulls 1/4 the water it puts out. Disappointed.

  This thing works too well. People are going to be late for work. Lose their jobs. The world's economy will be destroyed. Use up all of the world's water. It makes showering great again (MSGA).  If one of these is in every home it might be considered an extinction level event. The pressure from my $60 shower head was abysmal. This $12 thing is the best and worst thing to ever happen to me.

  If you like steam showers, this would work as the showerhead provides a mist and not a high pressure shower. As a showerhead, this was terrible. It leaked on the first use (see the drip in the pic), and because the water stream was only a mist, it took too long to rinse off. I will be putting my old showerhead back on.Update:Day 2 was worse. It began leaking in 3 places and some of the water streams are going in different directions, as if they are clogged.

  Ok, let me start off by saying that this would be an ideal showerhead if you have a completely tiled in shower, and glass doors. If you are using a shower curtain, and if you have drywall above your shower stall, you probably don't want to use this showerhead. Otherwise, if they could make this in a regular pressure, 2 GPM model, I'd be all over it.I have extremely hard water at my house. I will post a picture of my showerhead and how it looked before I switched it for this one. I always wondered what it did to my hair and skin but never really thought about a solution as I do not have a house water-softener system. I saw an ad on Facebook for a showerhead like this and it got me thinking. Then I saw this on Amazon for about 1/4 the price and decided I'd try it. We had to buy a shower hose and an adapter to put it on. It fit on just fine. The water pressure is SERIOUS on this thing. My regular showerhead is rated for 2 GPM for water savings, and I don't find it to be lacking in pressure at all. This head though... it must use MUCH more water, because the pressure is insane. The water pressure is so much that it causes the shower curtain to billow in on you something crazy. I even tried weighing them down with heavy plastic clips... it didn't help. To make matters worse, the water pressure is so strong that when it hits you, it also bounces back off of me in a mist and soaks my ceiling and walls above the shower. So between it going everywhere all over the place because the shower curtain wouldn't stay in place, and my ceiling and upper walls being soaked, I couldn't keep using this showerhead.I must say though, I could feel a significant difference in how soft my hair felt after showering with this filtration, and my skin felt different too. Not as dry and tight after a shower. I just wish they made it in a less intense version. So as far as softening the water, this definitely works as advertised, it's too bad I can't keep using it.

  I live in New Jersey and as everyone knows, the water here is hard water. I have been using shower head filters for a year already. It reduces the hardness of the water. This time, I replaced my regular shower head with this high pressure filter-type of shower head, and my water became cleaners. I tested it with a device and it shows 140 as the water cleanness level. Government says that water within 150 is safe to use. So I guess the combination of this new shower head and my old filter work very well.

  I kept seeing a similar item advertised on FB and my little girl has long curly hair and very low water pressure in her shower so showers were taking forever.  I went on Amazon and looked for something that looked just like the photo of the product I saw on FB, and this item does so even though it had a different brand name they looked identical.  I just popped it onto the hose on my daughter's shower, turned on the water, and voila!  WATER PRESSURE!  I just have to figure out how to turn on all 3 water flow settings because I only saw 2 . . .

  I didn’t think much of this shower head until I installed it. This thing has a lot of power and 3 different settings. It did have the leak at the connector but I think it could be fixed if I put another washer in the hose. I think it needs a longer connection, I think the end doesn’t seal good because it’s a little short.Anyway I loved the power and spray. It sprays hard but it doesn’t hurt. I think the filter really works well. It took away the smell of City water. My skin on my arms and legs started exfoliating and washing of the dead skin cells.This thing makes your skin feel tight and it gave me a super grip with my hands . After I dried off my skin felt abrasive and I could rub off the skin cells but now that I am completely dry, my skin feels very smooth. This thing really loosens up dead skin cells. There’s a callus on my thumb and now the skin is starting to flake off. I would have given this 5 stars except for the leaky connection, but I’m sure I can fix it by going with double rubber washers.The holes are so tiny like pinholes but it definitely puts out water. It does look it might break if you dropped it but we’ll see how it holds up.

  Was skeptical with the low price. I just received mine today, im dorky with purchases and had to try it out right away. Love this shower head! I can't give an educated review of the water quality with this shower head... I'll take it for what they say. However, the water pressure definitely increased way more than I expected. Big difference. Love the three settings as well, it has a mist mix that gives a softer feel with the water. And the jet is pretty powerful. Overall, I would definitely recommend this shower head to anyone.

  I like to use a lot of cast iron and stainless steel pans. But you know what's the worst? Burnt on oil.I bought these on Amazon because they were both cheap and well-reviewed.I expected these to be tough on my hands. They weren't.I expected them to fall apart pretty quickly. They didn't.I expected to have to use a lot of scrubbing force. I don't.What did they do? They removed the burnt on oil on my stainless steel pans and cast iron pans with a refreshing ease. You apply a little pressure and move it around, and the grease disappears. It might not even help to apply more pressure, and probably decreases the life of the scouring pad.These are cheap enough not to even give another thought to. Just put them in your cart and get them when you've spent enough to get an add-on item.

  We used the command hooks to hold curtain rods that we wanted to hang at ceiling height. You need to leave about a half an inch above the top of the hook to place the cover/hook over the adhesive strip,  which meant that we could not hang them quite as high as we desired. They also do not have much reach away from the wall so that the curtains slightly rest on the blinds on our windows.

  I bought 2 of these hooks and used them with the adhesive and my lightweight curtain rod and light curtains (which couldn’t be heavier than 3 lbs) fell down twice :( After using all the adhesive available in the pack, I bought a third hook for security and the 16 lb capacity picture hanging strips just in case, and two hooks gave out on me. The curtains fell on my face in the middle of the night, about 30 minutes after I installed them. I’ve attached photos of the failed hooks, in addition to the remaining trooper, valiantly still at his post.I would like to add that I’ve followed the instructions for the adhesives each time, leaving the strip to stand alone for about 2 hours and have had this fall down on me each time. My walls are neither particularly slippery or dirty in any way (this is a new apartment). Unfortunately, I am now out of command strips and hope. I hope this review helps someone.

  I purchased a set of these for a curtain rod across a single 36” bedroom window.  I don’t want to drill in a rod bracket.  I cleaned the walls (painted drywall) with alcohol and followed the instructions to a T.  After two hours, I placed the curtain rod with a single panel curtain onto the hooks.... 10 minutes later one of the hooks fell off the wall taking the paint with it.  Package says these hooks have a 5 pound weight limit but I can guarantee the rod plus the panel was about 2 pounds at the most.  So now I’ve got to touchup where the paint came off and figure out another solution.  I then decided to reuse this single hook with a new adhesive strip.  I followed the same exact instructions and put the hook on my laundry room wall.  This time it lasted an hour and a half holding a feather duster!!! then fell off the wall.  I don’t know if it’s the hook or the adhesive strip or what but I’m done using 3M products.  They cost so much and they simply don’t work as well as advertised.  I think I’m going to try Gorilla glue or tape instead.

  I purchased the large hooks for the purpose of hanging headphones on a wall. Of my headphones, the widest headband is about 1.5"". Given the dimensions portrayed in the one image, I thought I found a winning solution. In that image, it looks to me like the hook depth, so what I would consider the distance from the surface of the base to the inner side of the hook, is 1.625"". This is definitely not the case. That space I'd described is barely over an inch at most.If you are looking to hang anything that has width/diameter of greater than 1"" or so, look elsewhere. I'm giving 2 stars since they seem well made and relatively robust. Had I not obliterated the packaging, I would be sending these back.

  I really like that I can get this type of adhesive hook without it having to be plastic. Kind of wish I had skipped the ‘wipe the surface with rubbing alcohol’ part though because it made the surface of my door look funny. Seems pretty sturdy from what I can tell. The doors I put these on do have a bit of texture to them, and one is in the bathroom where everything gets all steamy a couple times a day, so I’ll update if anything changes. Also, I repositioned one (each hook comes with two adhesive strips each), and can attest that it did in fact remove easily and without damaging the door. If it had been stuck longer than about ten minutes that might have changed, but the experience helped me feel confident in the efficient removability anyway. So far, I’m very pleased with this item.

  I like the Command hangers in places where I need something more than temporary but not permanent. Or in places where I do not want to put a nail in the wall. They are better than suction cup hangers that fall off with changes in temperature in the room. These particular hangers are much larger than the medium hangers. They hold up well and do not mark the walls. This package had an extra sticky wall mount which was nice to have for if I need to move it at some point. The ding on stars is because of the price. I think they are a bit over priced for what they are.

  DO NOT BUY, BAD PRODUCT. Maybe you can use it for picking up clean things.  Dirt and pet hair stick on the filter and become crammed in to narrow slots around the  opening. Much too much interaction with the dirt. If you want to pick up spilled powder or dust or cold ashes it blows it out the back end. Also when you open it to clean the unwieldy handle doesn't lie down flat and rolls around. The last cordless vacuum I had from Black and Decker would automatically recharge when you put it in the cradle. I didn't re order that model because the battery shortly refused to hold a charge that lasted more than 1 minute. This one is hard to fit on to the badly designed cradle and then you have to mess around putting the plug in the vacuum the correct way. I hate it. I didn't use it right away so I didn't know how horrible it is so I can't return it. I will write a bad review as often as I think about it unless Black and Decker want to give me another model or my money back since I get angry every time I use it. DO NOT BUY, BAD PRODUCT

  I've only had this product a few days, but so far it's great. It has good suction and comes with two attachments (a brush and a crevice tool). The wall mount is really convenient too (you do need a drill to install it). I have limited counter space in my house, so getting it off surfaces really helps declutter. I bought this to replace a different model of Black+Decker handheld vacuum that would only have full suction for a few seconds after charging (after only one year of use). After doing research, I found that the problem lie in the battery. I kept my vacuum continuously plugged in, but apparently that is bad for the battery and causes the problem I was having. So for this vacuum I only charge if 3-6 hours after use then I unplug it. This one charges quickly and I haven't had a problem. It is super easy to empty and clean and so far I have loved it. I have used it to pick up spills, dirt piles from sweeping, kitty litter around the litter box, and dust on the baseboards. The only thing I could wish for is a way to store the attachments on the wall too.

  When I first unboxed the Black + Decker cordless lithium hand vacuum I was doubtful about the quality of the vac due to its light weight. In the box, along with the hand held vac, were two attachments, a brush attachment for furniture and stairs and a crevice attachment for confined spaces, a charging cord, reusable bag filter, vacuum wall mount and packet with two amounting screws and two plastic wall anchors.I switched the power switch to the “on” position to see how easy it was to switch the appliance from “off” to “on” and was surprised when the vacuum turned on because I hadn’t charged it yet.I was also impressed to find noted on the wall anchor and screws packet (2 plastic wall anchors and 2 screws come in each packet) the size of drill bit that I would need to use to make the pilot holes when mounting the vacuum’s wall-mount bracket.I charged the vacuum for about 20 mins before testing it out and was pleased to find that I was able to vacuum up all of the pieces of cat littler that were surrounding our cat’s box! I’ve had to drag our large floor vac out to deal with this in the past and am so happy I can now easily reach for the hand vac throughout the day! Removing the dust collection bowl from the vacuum unit was a snap, I only had to press a release button easily accessible on the top of the handle.I was also pleased to see that once I have mounted the vac on its mounting wall bracket I can keep it plugged in so that’s it’s ready whenever I need it! Also, the charger automatically reduces power consumption when charging is complete.I registered my vac, for the limited 2 year warranty, in a couple of minutes on the phone with a friendly customer service rep (also had the choice to register it online as).All in all, for the money, this vac was a great buy.

  This is the best model! I bought this and also the highly reviewed and more expensive BLACK + DECKER CHV1410L. The HHVI315JO42 wins! Honestly the suction side by side feels the some. Yes the CHV1410L has a longer and narrower build for small places but it is twice as heavy and the charger is a dock which takes up more space and prevents hanging on the wall. I find HHVI315JO42 model is narrow enough for my needs (plus it has a long narrow attachment) and the light weight makes it easier to use. It can stand straight up and sit on its butt while charging, or you can use the provided wall mount, as the charger is a small port in the handle. It's also much easier to remove the bag for cleaning. Wins in every category. Not sure why it's the cheapest as it's better looking and better functioning than other black and deckers.

  I have a super shedding basset hound. He sheds everywhere, every day. I got this to try to combat all the hair that is all over my house, but it doesn't do a great job in picking them all up. The battery doesn't last as long as it takes to vacuum the couch. And the suctioning power isn't strong enough to lift many of the hairs.

  There weren't any filters in the dust buster. Took it out of the box, put up the wall charger and plugged it in. Went to use it today for the first time and discovered after a few minutes that my pants were getting covered in dirt. I took it apart and looked through the manual to see what was wrong. No filters. I tried to contact Black and Decker through their website but if there is a place to email them on the contact page, without registering a product I may not keep, I couldn't find it. If you have to buy the filters separately the description should warn you. It is also very loud. I do not know if this is because it was running without filters and dirt got into the motor. Unfortunately for me my Dad, trying to be helpful on recycling day, threw out the box. We had a good Black and Decker cordless vac for years which is the only reason I choose this brand again.

  This thing is pretty darn sweet!My thoughts so far:It's been 4 hours since I got this gadget and already I'm impressed. The response is fantastic. I'm still using it on my local network but I verified my email and I'm hoping it can be triggered from work, etc.I installed the TP-Link into a socket inside my garage, then used it to trigger a fan on the outside of said garage, so it creates a breeze for the dogs in the backyard.The benefit of this is because I can set a schedule on the app so it goes off at certain times of the day, therefore, enabling me to cool my dogs on-time for a certain amount of time.Plus it was our dog's birthday and she wanted more fans............... ����The app is good, too. It's good.Buy this sh*t.*I added a picture of my dogs so you know I'm not a lunatic.

  I have had good experiences with TP-Link devices in the past, so I had high hopes for these little WiFi outlets, and they didn't disappoint.1) Setup was a piece of cake: just plug them in and use the Kasa app to configure them.  You can also control these by voice if you are an Echo user -- adding them as new devices is easily done through the Alexa app.  (They are also compatible with Google Home devices.)2) They are small and unobtrusive, projecting about an inch and a half from the outlet.  And because they are so compact, you CAN plug two of them in at the same receptacle, one above the other.3) They require NO HUB, since they connect via WiFi -- this is a huge plus!4) They are very easy to control with the Kasa app, which is well designed and fairly intuitive.  You can use the app not only to turn the plugs on and off but also to set schedules so lamps or other appliances turn on and off at designated times.I have had no connectivity issues with these, and I would certainly buy them again.  (In fact, I will almost certainly purchase more because I keep finding new places where these can be useful!)A tip for Echo users: I try to limit the number of different brands and makers of my smart home devices beacuse each brand typically has its own phone app and adds an extra layer of complexity to the whole setup.  But inevitably you are likely to have devices from several different brands.  If you like to set schedules and routines for plugs, lamps, etc., rather than using each individual brand's phone app, you can set all of their schedules using the Alexa app.  This greatly simplifies things, as you can look at ONE app to see the schedules of all of your different devices.

  I am a huge fan of these and I devised a plan to make it easy to remember what each plug is called to Alexa.  Having a sequence of words like “living room lamp” was tripping me up because sometimes I would accidentally leave out a word like room and my commands wouldn’t work.  So in each area of my house I have each plug labeled with a word that has a natural partner.  In my living room one lamp is Stevie and the other is Wonder.  In my dining room the two lamps are my grandmas first and middle names respectively.  And the bedroom lamps are named the same way.  This is much, much easier to keep track of, try it...and as a bonus it’s much more fun!

  I really like the TP-Link brand and this smart outlet is no exception. With this unit one can at least plug two (2) things in at the same time in the outlet (one smart plug and one regular plug or two smart plugs).... HOWEVER the smart engineer would have put the plug part of the smart plug on the side, top or bottom so that it didn't stick out of the wall 2""+ and with a plug... almost 4"".  That leaves the plug way out in the room if it is behind something. Great plug... poor engineering.

  I have an Amazon smart plug and these Kasa smart plugs by TP-Link work just as well.  Once you have the Kasa app installed, setup was a breeze and took me less than 2 minutes - including updating the plugs to the latest software version.  It is very well integrated and were discovered easily by Alexa w/o any hiccups.Once that is done, you can group them together however you like.  I even create scenes using geo-fencing that will turn on my kitchen lamp when I am near home.  I planned to use one of them for my Christmas lights.  This way I don't have to bother with the old timer like before.The plugs feels solid and high quality.  The side power button turn on manually with a satisfying click.  The Kasa is actually a little smaller the Amazon smart plug.  Long term, I have an older TP-Link plug I bought over 2 years ago and it is still working like a charm.  Haven't experience any disconnect from my home Wi-fi yet.Why get just 1 Amazon smart plug when you can get 2 of these for the same price, built, quality, and ease of use.

  I really like these bulbs. They are super bright. They emit a very bright, white ""daylight"" that is great for in the bathroom because you can see everything - not as ""flattering"" as warm lights but much better for knowing what you actually look like in the morning when you're getting ready. No more thinking you look great and then getting to work and realizing you did not quite fully blend the makeup as well as you thought.

  I make a whole range of hot pepper sauces and I couldn't find the right size fermenting weight for a 1 Gallon glass jar. Or the weights were just ridiculously expensive. From the pictures these looked roughly the right size, were made out of silicone, were flexible, had holes to allow gasses to go through but small enough to hold contents down. So I figured I'd give it a shot cause worst case I have drains here too. Well, they work great for this purpose. I just run them through the dishwasher first, then use them in my fermentors.

  We have been struggling to find a hair catcher for our bathtub drain for a long time! Finally came across this and thought we might as well give it a try as it was pretty cheap and had good reviews. It was delivered today and I went to install it and got a little disappointed as it didn't fit right away as I thought it was taller so it would work with our drain. After messing with it a little and looking through other people's review pictures, I almost was ready to return it when I saw how shallow everyone else's drains were, but I thought maybe I should try cutting out the innermost dots to form a circle so I could stretch it around the circle on our drain and maybe it would work. I used my Cricut knife blade to cut from one dot to the next and ended up with a more hexagonal shape than a circle. I stretched the new hole around the top of our drain and now it works like a charm! Super excited that I could modify it to work for our needs. I was worried that our drain would still be too tall as it doesnt sit perfectly flush with the bottom of our tub, but when I tested it with the water turned on, it seemed to work really well! I will have to try it out tomorrow when I take a shower and see how well it catches hair but it works great for draining water through and now sits nicer on our tub!*Update on 4/9/21We have been using this drain cover for a few weeks now and it works amazingly! It is easy to clean and works great even in our taller bathtub. I have long hair and have had to clean it out a few times, which is good since it is actually doing its job! 10/10 for this product ��

  Initially I really liked the colors and the material. However, I thought it was too big and the design too prickly. But after using it several times, I understood the design and I can say I really like it. I immediately replaced my old one which I really didn’t like. This silicone hair catcher performed efficiently!  Even if it moved a bit it  still covered the whole drain as it is quite large. It caught all the hair, both short and long. After use I removed the long hair and then followed the advice online and waited until it was dry. It was so easy to clean then.

  I was using metal mesh drain strainers for my tub and bathroom sink, but the mesh was too thin and caught everything, including spit when brushing my teeth (yuck). I needed to clean them after every shower, which was a pain, and even with that, they started molding after about a month. I decided to try something new, so I bought this product and it works well for the tub/shower, but they're just too big for the bathroom sink. These are like 5 inches in diameter. I'm also testing one out for the kitchen sink, but I haven't used it enough to decide if I will keep it there or not.For the tub, it seems to catch my long hair but I don't know how well it works on my husband's body hair. It seems like they might make it past the rubber nubs if there's enough water flow. I'm not really sure how to test it, but it doesn't seem to be filling up like the metal mesh one did. That does mean the tub doesn't start filling up towards the end of my shower like with the mesh one, which I appreciate. It stays in place well and is easy to move.For the bathroom sink, it takes up most of the bottom of my small curved sink. It stays in place even though the bottom isn't flat, but water builds up above the sides and sits under the drain cover, which has caused build-up of what I call ""sink grime"" after only a few days.For the kitchen sink, it fits nicely and stays in place well, and I appreciate it being soft and rubbery to protect dropped dishes a bit more. It seems to catch larger food scraps pretty well, but I don't know how often it will need to be cleaned yet.I would recommend this product for bathtubs so far, but I still need to see if I can test how much hair it's actually trapping.

  This doesn't stick to the bottom of the tub (I have tub/shower combo). I felt like an idiot trying to figure out if I was doing something wrong. Kept pressing it down thinking it should stick. I had to come back & look at product details to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong. Then I read reviews and really felt dumb because most of them complain about it not sticking. It floated on top of the water and barely caught any hairs. Cannot use this. Can't afford to clog up the pipes. Very disappointed because they look great.

  Take it from me, you do not want hair going down your shower drain, especially long hair.  Unfortunately for me, as huge as this hair catcher is (it's about the size of my hand!), I had to have my shower drain snaked after switching to this product.  Not right away, of course, but after using it for a year or so.  On its own, it does not prevent all hair from going down your shower drain, and you actually should try to prevent all hair from going down there, as I learned the hard way.  It is disgusting to see what all went down the drain and the gunk that builds up and sticks to long hair in a drain pipe.  In my case, this problem escalated to having a leak on the ceiling of our garage below the shower that had to be snaked, which was costly to repair.  The spikes are too far apart and hair can get past them easily.  Also, it gets moved around easily on the floor of the shower (there's no suction), so when it's off the drain holes and off to the side for a few seconds, hair sneaks right down.On top of this, I found that they develop mold, and I could not clean off the black stains from them.  No wonder they come in a multipack, I figured.  Anyway, so long and farewell to these ""hair catchers"".

  I bought this on a whim. I needed some raceway and wasn't sure about the size. So I went with the middle size (CC01). My TV is a Samsung QLED that only has a single optical cable to run all inputs and power. But I also have LEDs running behind it and another optical cable for the sound bar. Next to all this was 2 thin power cables from two Ryobi devices (a stick vac and hand vac). *See pictures 1-3* The T connector allowed for a lot of room to cover up any sloppiness. *Pic #4*  This raceway EASILY fit my extension cord, 2 power cables and 2 optical cables.  -But I also have another TV setup in this room and it has a power cable, as well as a HDMI cable (see picture #5). In that picture you'll see one think HDMI along with the power cable and I can easily fit a couple more.**For you all I decided to test this and grabbed 2 thick + 2 thin HDMIs, plus a power cord (pictures 6 & 7) and it all fit inside.After my installs I still have over 7ft left. So on to my family room I go.Pros:*Price*Easy to Install*Easier to cover up sloppy installs*Length*Different connectorsCons:None really... You'll need a good straight edge (and level) to install straight. Unless you are using a 3ft level you'll have a hard time installing it straight (without the straight edge)If this helped you please mark it as helpful so I know that it's worth spending the time to do longer reviews with pictures etc. Thanks

  I needed to conceal some not-so hot looking wires sticking out of my floor speakers leading to the tv stand. The plastic covers (concealers) seemed sturdy and well cut. The tape provided is really sticky; worked great. Be careful not to place the tape on the wrong place or it may peel off the paint if you try removing the tape from a painted surface. This happened to me. The only issue I had with the product is its poor instructions. The instructions provided on the package are vague. I tried looking for instructions online on how to attach the concealers but, I was unable to find any.After installing the concealers, I was impressed and satisfied with how well the concealers looked. I thought the concealers were going to stand out too much but, they didn't. I also thought the connections connecting the concealers were going to make the connections look ugly. I tried leaving the connections off but, it looked better with the connections (unions or whatever they are called).I have attached pictures of the before and after look. I definitely recommend giving this product a try. It is not expensive. It is definitely a valuable item to use if you want your entertainment system to look clean.

  First, if you believe that installation is as simple as the video indicates, I have a bridge in New York I'd like to sell you. On the plus side, I do like the final appearance after installation is complete (see attached pic), but that is purely a matter of taste. Fortunately, I did not need to repaint as the color fits well with our newly painted walls. I cannot comment on use of the adhesive as I elected to use the wall anchors instead. A simple matter of drilling two small holes in each piece and screwing into the wall. If I should ever have need to remove, it will be a lot easier to fill the small holes, fill and repaint, rather than worry about tearing up the existing finish. The instructions state that it is not for use on textured walls anyway, and I took them at their word. I only have one speaker wire and so this setup is more than sufficient for my needs. The down side is that one package did not offer a sufficient run, but I have no issue with  ordering another to finish the job. Summarily, take your time and use care while installing and the final result will look a lot better than exposed wires and I found the quality sufficiently acceptable as well.

  I ordered these cord covers as a, “I’m really sick of looking at all these wires! New year, new me! Let’s get some house to-dos done!” I received them and immediately procrastinated for about two weeks until finally I was sick of looking at the unopened box and just decided to tackle what I thought would be a project. Turns out the hardest part of everything was removing the protective backing of the adhesive used to keep the covers in place on the wall was the hardest part (I have no free edge to my nail so I had to use a butter knife to get the paper off the tape). It literally took me 5 minutes total to do the, albeit small, yet exposed section. Now I’m actively looking for more areas with exposed wires because A) I’m simply obsessed, and B) I have A TON of covers and angle clips, and tape, leftover. The only trick I can provide is once you slide the two parts of the white cover together, you need to make sure they kind of snap into place. And that’s it! So glad I found a modicum of motivation to finally cover my annoying tv cords!

  I bought this to hide several cords from my TV setup - including a set of three HDMI cables (on the left in the photo) and a power cord (on the right in the photo). Three HDMI cables are tight, but the room in the channel is sufficient. I received more than enough materials to do the job and could probably use the remainder to hide a bunch more cords elsewhere in the house if I wanted to. I got a little confused about the connectors, but Dulamo was very responsive by e-mail and provided assistance with installation (which is not particularly difficult). Good value, good product, and I'm happy with the results.

  So, as for the product working, these velcro zip ties are excellent.  They work perfectly.  However, it seems that a machine is responsible (as should be expected) in making sure there are 100 zip ties of the same length in the bag.  Here's where they are cheating.  The first tie to come off of each roll was different, one 2"", another 4"", a third 5"", but not the 8"" promised on the package.  At the end of the first roll there was another 3"" tie.  So, there are several ties in the package that are not as advertised.  Since there are three rolls in the package, this means that 6 ties are guaranteed to not be 8"".  This may not seem like a big deal to you, but if you can imagine how much money that velcro pockets from each and every person that buys these with their false advertising, you can see how that isn't exactly a moral way to go.  Fix your machines velcro.  Someday, someone will file a case against you and you will have a lot of explaining to do....

  I regularly purchase the Velcro One Wrap Brand from the big box stores in a five pack at $.70 for each tie or $3.50 for the pack.  When I saw the same brand on Amazon for $.08 for each tie, I was one happy repair guy.  Upon arrival, it's obvious that this is not the same product.  The strap itself is much less thick and not as ""grippy.""  As you know, Velcro is a ""hook and loop"" closure, and the ""loop"" portion (the side that feels fuzzy) is extremely thin on this product.  I had assumed that the ""Thin Strap"" in the name referred to the width of the tie, but it's the thickness.  So they still close, but they're just not as robust.  I'll end up keeping these thin straps due to the low price, but I'll still stock the hardware store's heavy-duty version for well... heavy duty jobs.  The photos below show the delivered Amazon product, the Hardware store product and photos of the two varieties of straps.  I'm sorry it's hard to see in the photos - it's very obvious when you handle them.Pros:• Excellent Price! (4 rolls w/ 25 8"" ties on each roll)• Velcro brand w/ simple system to attach to cords• Easy to tear off pre-cut rolls• Ability to double the length of tie by leaving multiple ties ""untorn""• Waterproof for outdoor workCons:• Thinner and Lighter than the Velcro you normally see• Easier to tear/break

  I'm a network engineer and I guess I am just spoiled by the thick and fluffy velcro ties we are given at work.  These ties work just fine, but they are paper thin and feel like I could tear them in half.  I think they will work in a ""set it and forget it"" type situation, but I wouldn't trust them to be reusable multiple times.  If you're the kind of person who changes your wiring around a lot, I'd look for something more robust.  If you're just tidying up and plan to leave it alone, these will probably fit the bill.

  Honestly...as ""Velcro"" is the originator and preeminent brand name, I expected a much higher quality. The material these ties are made of is EXTREMELY thin!!! So thin in fact they are easily torn in half even when trying to separate them from their self-contained coil. Do they work? Yes, they do keep cables together. My concern is ""for how long?"" The hook and loop is also very thin and non-aggressive. If I had to rate them for durability, it would be no more than ""Light Duty"" at best. Prior to purchasing these, I was buying ""dollar store"" knock-offs, which (as it turns out) are far superior in every sense of the word to these. Thank goodness they are so very low cost, which (in the end) should have told me not to set my expectations so high.UPDATE #1I've been using these steadily now for over a month. Am almost through the first spool of 25. My first reaction to their quality and durability may have been premature. Having wrapped and unwrapped many of them over and over, they still appear to be working fine. At this point I will raise my rating from 3 to 4 stars and change my classification from ""Light Duty"" to ""Medium Duty.""UPDATE #2It'd been almost a year. I just finished the first roll of wraps. None of them have failed under medium to heavy use. I cases where I needed a longer wrap, I've doubled them with no problem. My only suggestion to the VELCRO Company would be to die cut the straps a bit deeper. I loaned a few to another photographer. He too ended up ripping off the end by accident, rather than it cleanly separating.

  I thought I'd save a little money and ordered these filters for our office Keurig. They arrived loose-packed in a plastic bag, which seems very sketchy to me.  Problem #2 is that the bag is labeled that the manufacturer is purelinefilters.com, but if you go to that site, this product is not there, nor are any coffee or Keurig filters.  I searched ""coffee,"" ""keurig"" and the p/n on the package, ""PL-900.""  All searches returned nothing. I'm not chancing this when the manufacturer doesn't even show this product on their site.  Also, the instructions say to soak for 15 minutes, when the pics on the listing say soak time is 5 minutes.  Made in China.  Not going to chance it.  Returning and will spend the money on brand filters (or at least verifiable manufacturing).

  I can’t get myself to use these. Immediate upon putting the pod in a cup of water to soak, the water looked like a charcoal mixture within seconds. These are made in China. This is on me for not reading before purchasing. I literally thought they were the specific ones made by the Keurig brand. I’m throwing away and going to the Keurig website.

  They arrived in their own box which makes it easy to store. The filters are very well made and easy to use.  Even though my water is filtered I fell more comfortable using an ideational filter for my coffee.  We are very happy with our NEW coffee filters.  Karen & Michael from Las Vegas.

  At first I was reluctant to try this brank of filters for my Keurig machine because I knew they weren't made by Keurig but, from other people's comments, I knew they would fit my machine.  I have to agree, they are a perfect fit and they seem to work just as well as the filters that came with my machine.  Actually, I had less trouble replacing the filter with this one than I did with the original ones.  The money savings on these filters make them worth trying.  I recommend using this product.

  There was no reason do design the vacuum base as it is.

  These are OEM bags at a premium price. They work as expected with no complaints other than the cost. They are easy to install in the base station and are usually good for at least 10 cycles before they need to be exchanged for an empty bag. The unit self seals when you remove it so dirt and dust don't get everywhere. They're a convenient if pricey solution.~ Kort

  These work great and are easy to install on the i7 base.  I don't like how I have to replace it when full, but I get it.  I purchased a $2 zipper to sew on and will update this after I use that for a while.  The type of material can be washed and dried and reused if I can get all the crap out of the bag.  By cutting the back open and sewing on a zipper (jean sipper for air sealing), I think I will be able to just empty and wash then reuse it a few more times.  Someone already came up with this idea and is selling online but the cost is around $30.Update.  Not worth the effort.

  This is the 3rd neck reading light (other two are different) I've had. The Glocusent is BY FAR the nicest. First,  when you put it around your neck, it's practically weightless. The other two had two double A batteries that sat on the back of my neck. Also, the way the arms lay, they automatically light up what I'm working on (I knit). At first I thought the arms were short & wouldn't be bright enough to reach where I hold my knitting. But that's not the case. The lighting is excellent. I like that the arms are short as one of my other lights has long arms & it's a pain to bend them up to light my knitting where I hold my work. And the others somehow shift as I'm knitting. These don't.  I like that they are rechargeable.  The adapter is a 'C', just like my Android phone which is handy. It comes with a cord. I use my own plug in adapter. I am so pleasantly surprised by these, I'm going to buy a back up & two more for my knitting friends as gifts.  I can't get over the quality of the illumination.  I can't comment on the battery life yet as this is the first time I'm using these. I wanted to get a review out right away. You will be happy with these. They look & feel well made. There is a small user manual. It explains the 3 lighting options. It says battery working time is 6-80 hours depending on mode & brightness. My husband likes to watch TV in our theater with no lights on. These are a lifesaver in that I can get knitting done in the dark. This light seems to concentrate the light so as not to be a bother to others nearby. Will test that when I get home & in the theater. Overall. I love this neck light. It's the nicest I've seen.

  The Glocusent LED Neck Reading Light is the best reading lamp of its type. The availability and choices of light illumination are superb. It is not a heavy and gangly lamp, as some on Amazon are. The arms are of the appropriate length, they are very easy to manipulate, and the unit is well made and lightweight. The battery size and the length of use from each charge are the best of all the units that I see advertised. I first started with the Ledgle reading lamps, but when I moved to the Glocusent version I immediately realized how much better this reading lamp was/is for me. I  recommend the unit wholeheartedly. A worthwhile investment.

  I don’t have the best lighting in this house or the best eyes, and that makes for a hard time cross stitching.  These are absolutely wonderful!  I can see my patterns and do my cross stitching which is so great during this quarantine.  Be sure to charge every night after use though.

  I absolutely loved this light until I went to charge it! It caught on fire less than an hour after plugged in! Luckily there was someone in the next room when the light caught fire on the kitchen counter, and thank God it was on a granite countertop and not on a soft flammable area! I’ve never had a problem with any chargeable device until this. The stench is still lingering in my house as I type this. Very frightened and disappointed.

I didn't find any downsides to this light so far. Highly recommend it.

  Wow. Game changer. I have to change my shower curtain liner a lot bc of a humid bathroom (yes, even with a fan on ��). Though there are greater issues in the world, why wouldn’t you want to save yourself some time with these hooks!

Added bonus are the rings themselves, the balls that were added hug the shower curtain rod so they never pop off. Something I never knew I needed either. Love these!

  I have been looking for a way to organize my girls' costumes. I had plenty of space on the closet rack, but hangers were too difficult for them to be able to clean up after themselves and it resulted in a pile of costumes all over the floor. I decided to give these a try and it's just what I was looking for. The closet rod was a bit too thick for the hooks, but I was able to gently bend them open just enough to fit. They stay on securely and move back and forth easily. I was able to fit over 20 costumes and I still have a few extra hooks left. Not the intended use, but perfect for what I needed!

  This is one of those items you didn’t know you needed, and once you get it you can’t help but wonder you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for multiple shower curtains. Buzzfeed made a list of must have items, and when I saw these I was like YES! The list was actually for Walmart, but Prime ships quicker than FedEx. I know you’re like, ‘It’s just shower curtain hooks.’ And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner, that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto you’re back watching videos online glad you caught that Buzzfeed one.

  Had an older set of these of different manufacture. I bent them open a bit to make them slide a bit better over the hump in my shower rod, and the metal broke after years of water exposure. These ones seem to have a bit more room in the hook. No need to bend. Seemingly sturdy, and truly flat black, not bronze. Great match to my other bathroom finishes. Definitely a challenge to get a whole room of flat black without dropping your savings on Kohler or something. Anyway, nothing else to say here. If you're interested, just buy it. You won't regret it. If you haven't had the dual hook style before, it makes washing your shower curtains really easy, and that makes me more likely to do it more often, so that's a win.

  They roll across my adjustable shower curtain rod well.  Item is great for those of us that have hand issues in terms of quickly removing the curtain liner for washing.  What I don;t like is the hook that holds the curtain liner is the same height as the hook that hangs the shower curtain - would be nice if the liner hook wasn't as tall so you don't see the liner from the front.

  We’ve been using auto sensor nightlights in our home for over 10 years. We started with bulb units and eventually went to LED as the technology changed.I have to say that these Vont LED nightlights are my favorite ones yet.  The unique rounded square shape adds a bit of character and I love the fact that the light, while nice and bright, has a matte finish quality to it giving it a warmer, softer, diffused style which makes it much easier on the eyes, especially when you wake up in the middle of the night.If I had one complaint, it’s that the light sensor (which turns in the light at night) is not sensitive enough and triggers the nightlight even when it’s light out .  In my basement I found that I had to swap the location of the nightlight because, while to my eye it looked like there was certainly enough light coming in during the day, there wasn’t enough actually hitting the sensor to turn off the nightlight because it was in a darker corner of the room.The unit is vey light  weight and can easily be placed in the socket such that the other outlet is not blocked and easily accessible.In the interest of full disclosure, I was sent a package of these for free in exchange for an honest review. That being said, I would instantly buy another package of these myself should the need arrive for more nightlights.

  I received the product from the vendor as part of a process to review the items for free but this is my honest opinion.Pros:1. Light is soft, white, and gives just enough for dark for places like a hallway or a bathroom.2. Devices are small enough to fit in almost any outlet space without taking up too much room.3. Checking the electrical usage on the light shows that it is using about as much as a standard LED nightlight (about 0.5 Watt)Cons:1. It does not use motion detection but that is a minor issue overall.2. It works on an ambient light sensor level, but because of such you cannot control it when placed into a windowless or dark location (such as a garage or a powder room) - If you enter the room it is on and when you flip the light on it is off. This makes the sensor no different than a standard nightlight.3. They feel flimsy. The product is good and appears to work well after a solid week of use but it feels cheap. This does not detract from its use but may make some people wary of where they put the item if there is a chance of any traffic.4. INDOOR ONLY!!!Bottom Line:For the price, this is a good item, especially when you get six at a time for one small pricetag. Aside from the overall feel of the construction and sometimes limited usage as a ""dawn to dusk sensor"" item, they are worth the time and expense. I have used Vont Products since they were known Divine LEDs and have rarely (if ever) had issues with them working.

1,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Flents Ear Plugs, 10 Pair with Case, Ear Plugs for Sleeping, Snoring, Loud Noise, Traveling, Concerts, Construction, & Studying, NRR 33",$2.98,5,"
  I purchased these ear plugs because I suffer from something called annoying neighbors syndrome. I'm not entirely certain of their activities, but I would liken the sounds coming from below and across from my apartment to that of an auto shop or a construction site, perhaps even an airplane hanger. It's particularly horrendous in the evening. Therefore, I have resulted to ear plugs to ensure I get a somewhat worthwhile night of sleep. The contour capabilities of these ear plugs make them incredibly comfortable to wear and the lime green color is particularly stylish, if looks are important while you sleep.... After inserting the ear plugs and allowing them to adjust, silence befell my bedroom. I was able to sleep free from the obnoxious noises that surround my apartment. My only complaint is perhaps these ear plugs work a little too well. I missed my alarm... by an hour and a half. For a full 90 minutes my phone alarm was ring-dingling away and the ear plugs blocked every bit of noise. After the initial panic of being late for work wore off, I was slightly amused that my neighbors had to listen to my alarm while I, for once, slept through their douchbaggery. These will be the only ear plugs I wear from now on. And I'm considering a louder alarm, so suggestions would be helpful.

  I read a review that mentioned that  a long time ""flents quiet time"" user (which is the purple earplugs) switched over to the ""flents quiet contour"" (high visibility yellow) because they were better in every way. So, I had just placed my annual order of the purple ones (been using for 4 years or so) when I decided to do a little research. I thought I'd  try these ""quiet contour"" ones, and see what was what. I'm a carpenter by day, also putting in a bit of time in a commercial cabinetry shop so these are a must. I was not impressed with the ""quiet contour"" ones. They aren't the same type of foam, these ones being more airy I'd say.... They don't expand to the same density. I tested them at the same time and the purple ""quiet time"" ones easily outperformed and felt better in my ear. They say they have the same noise reduction rating, but I see the green ones say, ""manufactured by MOLDEX"". Whatever that is, I'm guessing that is where the difference is. A pro-tip, and what sets these apart from the cheapo ones that most employers supply is that if you keep these in your pockets, they can go through the wash a couple times before they're no good. No sense throwing them away after one day's use...

  I wasn't sure about Flents contoured earplugs, and was fairly happy with Flents Quiet Time Ear Plugs, but decided to take a chance on them. After all, I've sold containers of 49-out-of-50-pairs of earplugs that didn't work in the past on that auction website we all love, and the contoured shape of the new ones seemed worth the risk.But now the days of carefully shaping earplugs multiple times to get them in the perfect spot are over, because all it takes to get Flents Quiet Contour Ear Plugs in is rolling them between my fingers so the inner part is narrow and the flared outer part is folded outward, sliding them far enough in the canal to get the bulge inside, and lightly holding it in place while the bulge expands, which takes maybe five seconds. In my case, at least part of the bulge gets past the narrow part of the canals in both ears, blocking out all noise except the sounds I need to hear while keeping the earplug from coming out on its own, and the earplug is long enough to be easy to remove but not long enough to stick out and rub against my sheets or pillow.As if always getting my earplugs in on the first try weren't enough, the Contour plugs work well for not two, not three, but five or six days! Granted, I have to push them in a little after the foam expands after the first three days or so, but there's no more angry jamming things in so far that my ears hurt by morning.I suspect this design could work for a wider range of people than straight or tapered earplugs, especially if they come in two or three sizes, but maybe I'm just lucky. If so, let me wish you the best of luck finding an earplug that works for you!NOW FOR THE CAVEATS:This won't be welcome news to many, but the external part of our ears is almost as unique as our fingerprints, so there is no such thing as an earplug that fits everyone. The outer part of the ear canal is made of cartilage which varies widely, changes shape when we move our jaw, and continues to grow and change as we age. And THAT means that unless you're very lucky, you're going to have to try a lot of earplugs before you find something that works well. I do recommend Flents Quiet Comfort earplugs as a starting point, but you may just have to try different kinds and brands before finding the right ones for you.Also, your sex, height, build, and the size of your outer ear won't tell you how long or wide your ear canals are. I'm female, 5'2"", and my outer ears are small and close to my head, but slim earplugs designed for women are too short and narrow for me.

  I’m pretty sure these are fake. They come in a foil pouch with a black and white printed label. All the pictures that I’ve hung up have come crashing down from my wall and glass shattered everywhere. Pictures that I’ve hung using strips from Target are still hanging.

  These things are great, they stick well, are removable, and work for a variety of things that need to be attached and removed. A couple of pro-tips:1. Don't place them directly on the corners (of say a picture frame) - they are a few mm thick when placed, and you will see them if they are in a hallway for instance. Place them a half to an inch in from the corner and it will help2. Stick them together, remove one side and place it on your object. Hold it up to the place you want it, get your spouse to agree (lol) and then remove the wall side paper exposing the sticky surface and place.3. If you got step #2 slightly crooked, no worries. Pry it away from the wall, releasing the velcro like attachment and re-place it where you like it. You can go a surprising distance to get it right in any direction.4. Buy more of these, you will find they are great all over the place - hope that helps!

  Here's the deal: I framed some of the art I wanted to keep. It's signed original art; not stuff I paid a fortune for, but made by friends who are artists and it's certainly not mass produced junk. So it's not light and fluffy. I had hoped that these strips would be practical. NOT AT ALL. I have been hanging up my pieces in my new apartment and I lost two pieces. Luckily I have some original 3M strips, which are doing a much better job of keeping everything on the walls. Be smart. Do not buy these. For the love of all that is holy, do not buy these. I'm still sweeping up glass.

  I don't know what I did wrong, but these were an enormous failure for me.  The sticky backing was barely sticky, if you could even consider it sticky at all. So clearly the entire point of these is to have good stick. Without, it's pointless. I have double sided 3M tape my husband uses at work, that stuff is literally permanent. I know 3M can make serious adhesive. But Ic couldn't use that permanent of an adhesive for my project, which was to ""hang"" some spice racks. These spice racks  literally weigh MAYBE a pound. I forget if I got the Large or Medium strips here, but they each supposedly handle 6 lbs or  8-10lbs. I was more than covered which ever one I got.The strips went onto the rack nicely, bc they have flat backs. But the second it went onto the wall, it was as if I placed it there with afreaking paper towel as an adhesive. Fell right down instantly, into my hands. I was like um ok.  I played around with them a little more, and they just never took. The ""velcro"" looking plastic bits snapped together nicely, that wasnt the issue, I could tell that was solid. It was 1,000% the adhesive. Or lack thereof. Once I really was like feeling the strips I was like these aren't even sticky. Like what exactly would this hold? A piece of a paper? MAYBE?These were a huge fail and annoying to wait for to find out they were cr*p. I will have to use either an insanely serious adhesive or put in more screws that I just didnt want to put in.  Thoroughly unimpressed.

  Would’ve given 5 stars except I only received 16 pairs instead of the 18 advertised, so I had to go out and purchase another pack (which cost twice as much as I paid here) Other than that they worked great for my scrabble wall project!

  I ordered three bags. The first two were fine; the backing peeled cleanly off every tab with little effort. Every tab in the third bag was defective however; none of the backing strips on any tab could be removed without damaging the sticky surface underneath. The failed third bag must have been very old, stored very hot, stored under pressure, or some combination of the above. Amazon refunded the defective bag, but what to do now? A failed bag in a replacement order of one would yield no usable tabs... off to Home Depot for more.

  What was I thinking? I bought this product twice before I tried it. I intended to use in many rooms with various light pictures. In my first attempt, I got  this very light frame flower picture to hang in the bathroom by placing multiple stickers just to be safe. It seemed to work and I was thrilled!About two hours after we heard a big noise and quickly discovered that the picture not only fell but also broke the toilet seat, dented a wall, scuffed the other wall and broke my picture. I am now left with two walls to patch and repaint, I will need to buy and replace the toilet seat and a broken frame that I had to dispose. Guess how much it cost me in terms of time and money?

  You have to wonder if the people who are burning these out have them overloaded. For example a single small room space heater... well I will let Consumer Reports tell you > The electric space heaters tested at Consumer Reports use 1,500 watts to fully power. So with an 1800 watt max outlet strip typical for a 15 amp unit means that you can only plug a limited number of additional things, hopefully drawing very little wattage if you do.I have been using the slightly cheaper model of this version from Belkin that doesn't have quite as much in the joules rating, and it has worked flawlessly since Dec 2017.I am mentioning this because I was put back by the photos of the holes burnt in them. I plug a lot of things into mine and there is never a problem, but of course that is a standard 46"" TV, or my 56"", stereo equipment etc. etc. etc. and it works without a whisper. I have a few space heaters in the house for emergencies and usually just plug them directly into the wall on a dedicated circuit. Space heaters are cheap and the threat of a lightning spike is remote but due to the price it is not a big risk. I'm not an electrician, but that is my two cents.I just bought two of these for only a couple of dollars more than my other one just like it. It has a few hundred more joules in the rating like 4 thousand some instead of 3900. Works great. If something goes wrong I will be back to update my review.

  We had most of our major electronics plugged into this ""surge"" protector when we had a lightning strike. It did nothing. We lost our 50"" TV, a Nintendo Switch, and our surround sound stereo system. The electrician who came to fix other damage caused by the lightning said these power strip surge protectors are useless. Apparently he is right. We read about the Belkin $300,000 warranty, but from what we've read, Belkin makes it very difficult to file a claim, and so we have decided to just file with our homeowner's insurance instead.If you are just looking for some extra outlets, I would suggest buying a cheaper power strip. If you're looking for something to protect against lightning strikes, you can forget this power strip and probably any other. Our electrician suggested we buy a whole house surge protector, which costs about $350, and so that will probably be our solution after we do some research on a reliable brand.. We certainly won't be buying anymore expensive surge protector power strips. This one at least was worthless.

  This is the third one of these that I've purchased, and the manufacturing level has dropped in a big way.  The first two I bought over a year ago and were solid/sturdy.  I bought this one a week ago and it arrived in a misshapen box.  Misshapen because whoever put it together decided that the on/off switch didn't need to sit straight on the plastic casing, and then just tried to screw it together anyway, bending the plastic casing and leaving the switch ""sorta"" on there.  They shipped it like that.  Obviously was not inspected by anyone.Amazon was cool and immediately sent me a replacement, but the replacement is of the same generation and is quite cheaply manufactured.  It functions as an on/off switch, but I wouldn't trust it to do anything else.  And I can't safely open it to verify the integrity of its internal components because the screws they use are single-use.So, yeah, pay attention to what you're buying here.  The price is cheaper than it was a year ago, and the quality of manufacturing has also decreased.

  The dual powered USB ports don't offer 2.4 AMP/12 W as advertised. The unit I received gives 1 AMP/5W for both USB ports combined and I verified it using Battery Pro app. When a device is being powered from one USB port, the 2nd USB port does not offer any current due to the low wattage on this unit. This is either false advertising or I received an outdated equipment.The second minor issue I have with this equipment is the power sockets are too close to each other, so any wider power adapter will cover the adjacent socket.

  I just got this power strip and right off the bat I liked two things about it - the cord (it isn't stiff and hard to bend!) and the ease of hanging it on the wall.  And speaking of hanging it on the wall - it comes with the screws to hang it.  My other power strips didn't.  I turn all my things off at the power strip when I am done in my sewing room daily.  I wanted the strips to hang on the wall to make this easier on my older knees.  And I didn't want to be trying to measure and guess where I had to attach screws to mount this.  I liked this so well I got a second one.

  This is exactly what I needed it to be. The USB ports were a must and this has 3. The flat head on the plug is a bonus. I was able to push my dresser back and minimize the gap. It comes with the ability to mount and as soon as I get my office arranged the way I want it, i will be doing just that.

  have a heavy printer on a stand with outlet directly behind it. Added an expansion outlet for printer and other items. Printer cable and another are very thick with very deep plug ends. So my stand would be a good 5-6"" or so from the wall. Always something falling behind it and the only way to get it back was to move the printer (80#) and the stand (very heavy). AAAAGGGHHHH!I chose this over flat outlets because I'd still have the depth of the thick cord and plug in. This item has a 'flatter"" plug than most. And I can set the strip on printer stand and plug everything in. It is close enough to the wall I don't have the worry of anything dropping behind it. And I love that it has surge protection and USB ports, very handy. Eliminates a few items I'd had plugged in and I don't have to charge phones and tablet one at a time because their plugs take up most of outlet space. Being long makes it easier to plug in odd sizes, I can still use the other plugs. And it feels very solid - I'm happy with it.The only thing that would make it perfect, is to make this so it plugs in with the cord running UP instead of down. Every place I have space trouble needs the cord going UP not down.

  I had a pretty significant hair clog in my shower.  I had tried chemicals.  Didn't work.  I ignored it.  Didn't work.  Ignored it some more.  Started to get slimy (don't judge me).  Saw this on amazon and that more than 2000 people had tried it and actually reviewed it, so I thought I'd give it a go.Oh my goodness.  This took no effort - I pushed it down the drain and it immediately caught something.  What came out was so disgusting, so vile, so yucky that it should have it's own X-Files episode.  Before it could lift it's head up and start quoting from the Book of Revelation, I put it in a plastic bag and dispatched it to the firey depths of hell from whence it was birthed.  Let some children dig it up in a trash pile in 500 years to have their future told.  I wanted nothing of it.My shower pipes were still praying ""The Angelus"" when I left for work.

  I’m so excited to finally have a bathroom sink that drains!! Since moving into my apartment, my bathroom sink and bathtub took forever to drain. I bought Multiple De-clogging solutions but they didn’t assist or help much with the problem. When my bathtub was taking over an hour to drain I decided it was time to try these out! After receiving it I went to work, within minutes it pulled out so much hair in both drains. it’s disturbing/disgusting yet weirdly satisfying because now my sinks drain!!Cannot believe how easy it was to use, (I received a pack of 3) but only needed to use 1 for both sinks.CAUTION!!! pictures are graphic and disgusting but you need to see how incredibly well these work!

  I live in an apartment complex and the maintenance people are pretty strict about not using drain cleaning chemicals but rather calling them to unclog a slow draining bathtub or sink. However, I have pretty long hair and I'm certain that the maintenance people don't get paid well enough to go up against the horror that's been building up in my bathtub drain over the past several years.When I got the Vastar snake drain cleaner I went straight to work. No instructions needed, the concept is pretty simple: you grasp the tool with the end that's a handle, push the pointy end down the drain, and the jagged part catches on the nest of hair that's swirled it's way around your plumbing. I didn't even get the thing 3 inches down before it was getting stuck on clumps of hair and built up gunk. I gagged my way through getting all nausea inducing blockage lurking in my bathtubs drainpipe cleared out.It's now clear to me why this is a 3-pack.... There was simply no way I was going to be cleaning off the plastic tool and reusing it. Very happy with this product, glad it comes in a pack.

  I had a slow drain in my bathroom sink.  I tried all the home remedies first, bleach, baking soda, vinegar.  Then I overpaid for some Drain Stix which were completely worthless!  Then I stumbled across this Drain Snake.  Hallelujah!  My sink drain is one of those ones where you can't pull the stopper out.  I slid this drain snake down through the slit between the stopper and the drain, twisted and I swear to God I pulled out the equivalent of a cat!  I pulled so much hair out of that drain that I could've made a clip on ponytail!  The drain immediately returned to its original unclogged efficiency!  A plumber wanted to charge me $150 just to come out and take a freaking look at the problem!  I can't believe how well this thing worked.  I was so excited about the results that I just went and serviced every drain in my house!  You have nothing to lose by trying this great device before you call the plumber!

  These were perfect for a clog in my shower and sink. I have very long hair so naturally my shower got clogged and I was standing up to my ankles in water every time. I was skeptical of how well these would work but decided to give it a shot instead of pouring chemicals down the drain while keeping my fingers crossed. It worked wonders! Though I didn't have much stuck in the drain, I got it out and cleared it completely.If you get resistance, you need to be patient and keep wiggling the piece around until you break free - I can see it snapping easily if you pull too hard. Be very careful too, because the barbed parts are quite sharp and that's indeed why these work so well.Same advice as others: get a trash bag ready! I recommend also wearing latex gloves if you can because it's difficult to remove the stuff off the barbs once you've pulled it out (if you plan on going back into the drain to remove more.)

  You Get  3 For The Price Of One - EXCELLENT PRODUCT - I ordered these as an add on and with the price point I had little expectations of this working ..... But though I would give it a try before using harmful chemicals in my bathroom sink drain.I was VERY surprised!  My drain cap does not come off yet there are 4 or 5 slots which I was able to put this snake de-clogger down.I was very impressed with the flexibility and ease of getting the snake into my drain openings and what came out ..... Lots of hair and gunk.As some of the readers stated ""this was junk"" I DISAGREE.... The snake gets caught on some gunk and yes it will pull and the orange teeth like may bend ....BUT ITS WORKING!I would highly recommend this item. I was SO HAPPY I decided to give this a try and I'm glad!You get three snakes and they are re-usable - depending on your initial drain clog - the first one might take a beating .... But you have 2 more to spare.I think I will use this monthly as part of my maintaince cleaning .....My 18 year old son was able to.do this with no issues ..... I highly recommend this product.It's MUCH cheaper then a 200$ plus plumber visit.

  This fit my daughter's whole room up by ceiling on wall like she wanted and we still had a tad left. I was shocked at the price for 50ft in all of it. Only thing is I would also add the adhesive on the strips to make sure it sticks if it's for the wall. We at first stuck it on without the extra adhesive and it fell down at night but now it seems to be staying up when I got extra double sided tape at the store and put it on. Colors are great and looks great. My daughter is happy.Also I don't know if others had same issue but I always read everything on box to make sure it's the correct product. The box doesn't say 50 ft on it like the picture says and I got confused and thought I got 16.4ft only like it said on box. I was actually going to return them disappointed but then luckily I looked back at the picture on here and the box I had and realized it also said 3 after 16.4ft. So it's 3 rolls of 16.4ft LED lights! Lol! Dumby me! Luckily I caught it before I returned them.

   I honestly bought these expecting them to be really bad, like how can almost 33ft of rgb led lights be this cheap without being bad? I’m thoroughly impressed! The lights are very bright / very dim depending on what you’re into, the colors look amazing, and the setup was extremely easy! I wanna go into depth about each and every thing I took note of but I apologize if my writing isn’t the best, I’m not an English major or anything lol.Shipping and Handling: The product came very quickly, it only took two days and I don’t even have prime shipping! The box was neatly packed with airbags for padding and the product came in pristine condition! All of the things included were neatly packed in a small box within the shipping box and they give you extra adhesive and pins if you ever need them!Build Quality: The product seems to be sturdy enough to be tugged a bit, I had used a bit too much force when I accidentally dropped something while installing the lights but no tears or breaks were found. The lights themselves are very nice, they produce color nicely and have a wide range of modes and settings you can adjust to your own liking. The product includes a IR remote for led control but I believe there is an app as well. The remote is perfectly fine, it’s a bit generic in terms of build quality and features but I mean... why change something if it’s not bad? It has 15 different colors to choose from and has extra buttons for everything from fading (as seen in video) to sound activated (it’s really cool!) you can change the brightness and even the way in which the colors flow and has programmable buttons to keep the settings you like. I will say though, that the lights themselves did smell a bit weird, like a plasticy smell. It’s not an issue though since it seems that the smell is only temporary as it’s slowly starting to fade but thought I should let you know. The only other complaint I have is the adhesive and short cables. So I have my lights plugged into the side of my bed and installing them was a pain, I had to constantly re-apply the adhesive near the beginning of the strip and then ended up just using clear tape to fixate it to my wall which worked perfectly! I’m not too upset or anything though, it’s not really a big deal especially for how much I paid. The short cables caused a lot of strain on my lights and they would constantly unplug but my tape fix also solved that issue, isn’t it great that little things can go a long way?Final thoughts: Honestly, I could not be happier! I paid what, like $13-16 or this? And they’re awesome! I love the way they make my room look so much nicer and I like the sheer amount of customizability. I had a little hiccup during the install process but it was 100% worth it. I love these so much and so do the rest of my family, I’m actually ordering my parents two more as I write this! I would definitely recommend this to everyone who is looking into nice and affordable lights!

  So I ordered a total of 3 I ordered 2 at first and they both only came with 2 rolls of lights and a white remote the white remote and then I ordered another one to do another room this time it came with 3 remotes and a totally different power supply and a different remote the remote is like the one in the picture black and all of the functions work correctly on this one. I was really surprised that I just recorded the 3rd one and it was completely different. Other then that they lights still work except the first 2 that I got the lights don't dim darker unlike the 3rd one I received.

  These lights are fragile so definitely take your time with the application process. If the instructions are followed correctly they’ll look great. If you’re putting them along your ceiling edge around your room you will need an extension power cable for either the 12volt AC plug or an 12volt extension cable for the other end since the plug they provide’s cable length is way too short.

  Yes, we had a sock in our dryer vent!! This past summer, the lint trap broke on our dryer. Our kids ran the dryer regardless! What disaster. Someone came out to fix our dryer, but told us we would probably need to get out a shop vac to get the lint out of the vents. Still, wet clothes, three weeks later. I decided to look for someone on amazon. Received my vacuum kit today, and now my clothes are dry! I sucked up the sock as well as a piece of lint roller tape. Great product!

  My drier was taking several cycles to dry a load of towels. I cleaned out the larger vent areas but couldn’t reach in at the lint trap. I ordered this item. I got quite a bit out. The fact that the tube was folded in packing caused a little trouble. It seemed to have a mind of its own when I pushed it down in there. But I was able to work around it. I took out the six screws holding the lint trap in. I would never do that again. I thought I would never get it back on, and it didn’t helpthat much. Other reviews talk about the fact that this item is just a nozzle and a tube. That is correct, and it probably cost very little it make. But you are paying for the idea. The cone fit tightly right on my vacuum hose. I don’t know of any other way to clean this out. The brushes you can buy just knock the stuff down. I wanted to pull it out. I am happy with this and would recommend it for purchase.

  At first, I went to a big box hardware store to try to make something like this but the price quickly added up to more than what this item costs so I decided to order this. And I am super glad I did. Our name brand dryer is only about a year and a half old and we empty the lint trap after every load. I hooked this product up to our vacuum and couldn’t believe how much lint, dust and debris it pulled out! This product is well worth the money, easy to use and will pay for itself in the long run by maintaining the efficiency and drying power of our dryer. The photo above is from our vacuum cleaner from one use of this product (the vacuum was emptied prior to use).

  I saw this product was recommended by Consumer Reports for cleaning out the dryer lint vent. It was amazing how much collected underneath the trap, even with cleaning it out before each load. This easily connected to my Shark vacuum hose and allowed me to remove years of dryer lint with little effort. If the tubing was a little more rigid, removal probably would have been even easier, but I was able to sort of nudge the end of the tube where I needed it to be directed with the use of a paint stir stick. My dryer is back to running a whole lot more quietly and with shorter dry times. Definitely recommend this product!

I had bought a long thin vent brush several years ago which I used to scrap the walls of the vent, but I could not collect the fine material I brushed off.

  I just used the exacto knife for this small project, but if I were covering a larger surface, maybe the smoother pieces would come in handy.It makes sense to have another person to help you with projects bigger than this. And DO NOT remove the paper all at once before applying. This should feel obvious to you, but I can see getting really excited about getting it on the surface (like a wall) and not waiting for help or planning how you’ll work together. You’ll want to start at the top, not removing the backing of the paper, and just slowly apply it, working your way down and smoothing as you go along. I suppose if you feel you’re good on what you’ve put up so far, you could carefully cut off the backing so it doesn’t get in the way and continue working your way down. Just go slow. If you don’t do these things, you’ll be cursing, and in a real mess, your paper ruined. It’ll get stuck to itself like scotch tape when it gets stuck on itself and you try to flatten it out ... which usually works with a few inches of scotch tape, and if it doesn’t, no great loss. You just don’t want it to stick to itself because1. The sticky part of this paper is more sticky than scotch tape so it’s going to be really difficult to flatten it out2. If you DO flatten it out, it’s going to show the folds it had while it was stuck to itself3. It will lose the strength - like scotch tape - of its sticky backing, and won’t adhere well4. It’ll make you crazy and you’ll feel so disappointed5. You paid for something you rendered useless and you probably won’t get a refund (MAYBE you would, but I’d kind of doubt it. You’d have to send it back looking like you did what you did, you know)?If your project is a big wall mural, I’d have a FEW people on hand to help, just in case. And save the wine for AFTER you’re finished! :) Just sayin’.

  This item was okay. It did the job but could be better. The red and blue tools are made out of plastic, which do the paper doesn’t tear, but the cutting knife would catch on it every time I was using it to cut a straight line. Also the roller is too hard. They make silicone ones that are much better. The knife was sharp and comes with extra blade and that is handy. Also the blue tool has a felt back on it and makes it easy to smooth out the paper. So. Two plus sides and two negative sides

  My first time using 'peel and stick' wallpaper. The tool I use for regular wallpaper would not have worked at all.

  I was redoing our old dresser's with a nice wood look contact paper and purchased this kit to do it with. I've completed one large dresser so far and have not even had to change the blade yet.

  Worked very well for my first time with wall paper (paste the wall) ... Only reason I gave it a star less is because the red blade thing never worked, the blade won't slide out and the roller was Har plastic which wasn't of much use. The only thing we used was the blue squeegee, the red flat thing for cutting guidance and the cutter for cutting. Just these 3 were more than sufficient. It would had been better if they were selling just these with a slightly lower price... That's my two cents. But the kit does it's work so I am satisfied.

  I used this tool set to do a kitchen adhesive backsplash and the squares were 12"" x 12"". That's a lot of super sticky material to work with. The blue smoothing tool was my lifesaver in preventing bubbles under the squares and having to pull the sheets off the wall to redo them. The blade was simple but effective to use. I didn't really use the red tool that much because the blue did the trick, especially with the felt edge, but I'm sure I'll use it in the future. Fork over the $6, it's worth the peace of mind you receive using it.

  I wish I had this kit sooner! Def using it again for all my future wallpaper/contact paper projects.I debated between the basic kit and updated kit and went with basic because I wasn’t sure if I would need it but I’m glad I did because the blue tool is good for pushing into wall corners/corners in general.I bought peel and stick wallpaper to use and it was really thin so applying it with this was still a slight pain (should’ve bought different wallpaper) but the end result was so worth it; I imagine without this kit I would have thrown all the wallpaper away and quit!Buy this kit if you are working on projects that these tools can help! So glad I read other wallpaper reviews who mentioned this.

The corner protector is strong enough that my toddler is unable to just take it off.2. It’s clear and minimal so it is visually pleasing to the eye compared to the other options out there.3. This protector has kept my toddler cry free!!4. As seen in the photo. There is no bottom part for one section of the corner protector to stick on. I used the widest part on the metal instead of at the base (where there is nothing to stick on). I have no issues with it. Yay!!

  These work great to protect people's knees from the corner of my glass coffee table. (Actually had to haul out the bandaids at a party). Yes you can see them, but they are pretty unobtrusive and don't interfere too much with the sleek look I wanted. Would be a little better if they were a bit more shallow, but I think they are made for a thicker table top than glass.

  Time will tell if these will stay on in an outdoor environment. I like the fit and they don’t look too bad. Whatever it takes to save our knees from the sharp metal corners! I didn’t have much trouble installing these, just notice that there are three unique stickers that only fit on one surface. Also, I recommend using a razor blade to carefully peel the cover off the sticker. Be confident, steady and take your time when putting the stickers on the protector and especially when fitting all three surfaces at once to your furniture. These are made to stick really well, so if you have stained or painted wood furniture they may not be the best choice. Maybe you could use these with command strips if you don’t want to damage your furniture.

  I needed something for my art table's sharp edges, but did not want it to look like I was baby-proofing my studio.  These are prefect!  Clear and barely noticeable, and they do a really good job.  They go on easily, and stick really well.  They don't stick out far like other edge covers I have tried, which is perfect.  They are clear, too -- not foggy or off-colored, so they do not interfere with the look of the furnishings. I am really pleased with this product.

  Purchased to cover all sharp edges to keep my newly blind dog safe.I looked at what seemed hundreds of corner protectors and chose these in the end based on reviews, price and because they are rounded.Can you see them when installed? YESAre they even a bit unsightly? Who cares! My dog isn't gouging out her eyeballs so we're more than satisfied!NOTE: Pay attention to the shape of the adhesives and be sure you're applying to the correct section of the protector.Would recommend to anyone. IMHO, much safer to use rounded protectors than rubber 'sharp corner' protectors.

  I ordered round and angled. I ended up using the angled.I had to use the upside down on the bottom half because of the way the piece was made.Found it time consuming to take the paper off of the glued areas. You have to be careful not to pull the glue with the paper. They did provide a large piece of 3M adhesive in addition to what’s on each piece. You just have to be patient and have a fingernail to pull off the paper. It wasn’t a big deal but, it would have gone faster if it were a better application.

  Rounds out the sharp corners of my coffee table without making it look tacky. My 1 year old has tried to take them off, but gave up after a few unsuccessful tries and now doesn't even bother with them. I am very satisfied because she just learned how to walk and would use the table to pull herself up and I was a nervous wreck. So now I have one less thing to worry about! Oh, not to mention it comes in handy when I accidentally bump into the coffee table myself! Shin saver!! Lol it was super easy to install. Just peel and stick! Literally took me like 10 mins to do 4 corners.Thank you!

  I thought the price was too good to be true but I trusted the Camco name as I've had very good luck with their products in the past.  As soon as I got this out of the package and ran my fingers around the threads I pricked my finger on one of the machining burs.

  these are well made solid brass 45º elbows... however the PLG Garden Hose Elbow Connector which comes in a 2-pack for $11.99 is almost exactly the same except without two little wings on the rear part you tighten - the PLG elbows have a typical standard hex-nut like premium hoses have on the female end... i ordered both the Camco andf the PLG 2-pack and see no difference in quality - unless you like the two wings for tightening...ALSO if yours leaks around the swivel as mine did the rubber gasket that comes with it is not big enough and it won't seal against the male hose bib... when i say the rubber gasket is not big enough - i mean the inside diameter of the hole in the gasket is too large, and it also seems to be made of flimsy rubber that gets chewed up when you try to tighten it... just try another standard rubber hose gasket with the inner hole a slightly smaller diameter - and that stopped the leak for me...works perfectly now...

  This is the perfect accessory for the Camco Pure Taste water filter if you are filling your fresh water tank from the side of your van/rv  thru a garden hose.Attatching this between the fill nozzle with the cut-off valve  and the filter removes the need for you to stand there holding the filter in a horizontal position so it wont break.You put this on and now you can insert the nozzle into your filler inlet and let the filter hang by itself on the side of your vehicle. No more stress on the nozzle or you!It has a nice all brass connector with wings for tightening onto the  nozzle end, and should last a lifetime.A must have item, and a steal at this price!

  I didn't like the idea of having a water hose hanging off our camper with gravity pulling on it all the time. I knew over time the hose would weaken there, about an inch or so down from the fitting and it could lead to leaks or a bend that would become a permanent restriction in the flow of water. Even with the hoses with the metal frames like the one we have will eventually have early wear. There's also a lot of tension on the fitting connected to the camper no matter what, but giving the extra stability of this 90 degree fitting makes me feel more confident.  We attached ours to a quick connect and keep our set up exactly intact for quick setup no matter if we are using city water or filling our potable. What's great with keeping this fitting on the hose for potable fill is that the 90 degrees is absolutely perfect to have it hang just inside the fill hole on it's own while you're filling up. That means I can be working on other things while filling our 2 tanks which takes a decent amount of time when they are empty. Such an inexpensive way to prolong the expensive parts you'd rather not need to replace.

  Thanks to Roger, my trusty plumber, and the Camco hose elbow, I drained the sediment from my hot water heater for the first time today.  As a new homeowner in May 2015, I thought I could forget about the water heater after I had it replaced.  Then last February, I ran across a home maintenance article that said a new hot water heater should be drained every six weeks for a few months, that every six months to 1 year.  Since it already been 9 months since the water heater was installed, I worried that I had damaged the hot water heater by neglecting it.Fortunately, a call to Roger solved the problem immediately.  He recommended draining the hot water heater once a year, including during this early period, so I could wait until June 2016 to do it the first time (but I did it early to be safe).  He gave me these instructions that were extremely easy and effective:1.  Do NOT shut off the water valves going to the hot water heater.2.  Connect a garden hose to the spout at the base of the tank, and run the other end outside where a large amount of water can drain.3.  Use a flat head screwdriver to open up the valve (90-degree turn) at the spout.4.  Let the force of the water pressure drive out the sediment for 15 minutes.5.  Close the valve at the spout using the flat head screwdriver.6.  Remove the garden hose.It was as easy as it sounds except for one detail-- the wall of the drip pan holding the water heater was high enough that the hose would have crimped over the edge.  Thanks to Amazon, I found the Camco hose elbow that would give more than enough height for the hose to clear the edge of the drip pan.  The Camco's connector allowed perfect positioning of the elbow vertically, and a similar connector on my Flexon 50-ft hose made the exit connection just as easy.  By luck, the hose was exactly the right length to snake off my porch and reach a water drainage ditch on one side of my yard.  There was zero leakage throughout the whole process, and the crystal clear water at the end showed that the flushing action was successful.I've seen quite a few variations on instructions for draining sediment, all of which were more complicated than Rogers version.  Although I can't guarantee his instructions will work for everyone, they worked great for my new water heater and took MUCH less time than I anticipated.

  Very sharp and worked well for the task I had. However, be careful getting it out of the package. The protective plastic over the blade flew off upon opening, and I stabbed my thumb.

  Even during the first use, the blade kept falling. I was just cutting a cake cardboard circle. At first, I thought may be it did not arrive properly assembled and so the blade was not properly secured.  After every adjustment possible, the blade kept on falling from the notch, while cutting. The blade does not even stay attached, for 10 seconds while in use. I had to hold the loose blade in my hand to finish cutting the thin cardboard.  NOT SAFE.  The ""safety"" cap is a joke. While you close it with the blade parallel with the cap, it is loose enough to fall down (When you hold the 'pen' upside down, the cap falls off as if it was simply placed on the top.).  So, you need to adjust it so the blade and the cap are at an angle. This way the cap becomes secure so it does not fall BUT the blade gets stuck in the cap unless you are lucky it comes out of the cap.  Zero star review is not an option, $5 lost.

  The Z-Series X-Acto knife is supposed to be the company's sharpest knife ever.If it is, I'm not experiencing it. I don't see in real-world use that it cuts any smoother or more accurately than the older knife and blade combo I've had for years. Worse, the knurled grip portion requires constant retightening, an annoying issue that costs this knife stars and one I've not had to this extent on any of my previous X-Acto knives.If I had to buy a knife again, I would not purchase this disappointment.

  I bought this X-Acto knife on the recommendation of some bloggers who do Scherenschnitte and silhouette cutting because, for Christmas, I did two silhouettes--one of my son, the other of my niece--for my mother. I am by no means an expert at fussy-cutting, but I know having the right tools makes beginning efforts and learning technique a heck of a lot easier. Based on their recommendations, I purchased this knife for a very reasonable price, and when I received it, I was pleased to see how sharp it was. It's long enough to feel weighty in the hand but comfortable enough for pencil-like grip to hold it. It was indeed very sharp, and cutting out eyelashes, lips, and bangs--and especially ""highlights"" in the hair--was much easier with this blad. I have used other blades just picked up in stores without much research, and I did indeed get a much better, more precise cut out of these.I'm still not an expert, but this novice came out with two silhouettes that clearly looked like the children I intended, so that's got to say something for this knife, right?

  I've been using X-Acto knives since the sixth grade when I discovered them. They have been immensely helpful in life and I have them at home, school, and work.I already had two X-Acto knives at home, but I'm drawn to shiny new objects, so when I saw this gold handled knife with sharper blades, I had to have it. It looks like the regular #1 knife, but with a gold-colored grip area to indicate that this is a sharper version with a ""Zirconium Nitride-coated blade."" The blade cuts through things effortlessly, but it's a new blade so I'll update over time on how long the sharpness lasts. Included is a blade cover which goes on tight (and gives a screeching sound when you put it on).As the sharper blades are the same size as the regular #1 blades, I may just upgrade all my blades to these. There is a #2 version of this knife with a bigger handle and bigger blade, but for some reason there are no sharper #2 refill blades.This is a great crafts knife that is incredibly handy to have.

  When they said this knife was sharp, they really meant it! I randomly purchased this item as an add-on because it was fairly cheap, but didn't imagine I would use it on many projects. I've used this knife on many DIY projects, even as a box cutter to open up packages and letters. I definitely have used it a lot but the blade hasn't gotten anywhere dull. The only downside is that using this to cut stuff for an extended amount of time will give you a sore shoulder because of the repeated amount of force you have to give to the knife to cut stuff repeatedly so be wary of that!It has a convenient cap too for when you're not using it.

  I came home this afternoon to this alarm going off.  I called the non-emergency line at the fire dept. and they told me to leave until they got here.  There was CO in my condo which I never would have known about unless I had this CO detector.  I didn't smell a thing!  I guess you never know if it's going to work......until it does.

  Warning to dog owners: Product may be great for intended purpose, but soon after installing my AmStaf/Boxer mix started acting like a thunder storm was coming (back of the closet and shaking). Stayed in there for 5 days while I researched storms, earthquake tremors, a Vet trip, and other possible causes. Uninstalled unit and she returned to normal by that night.

  I just received these so the review can't be all that useful or thorough.  Only time will tell with this kind of purchase.These units are about the size of a large fist.  Each is unobtrusive on the wall, being white.  Batteries are advertized as having a 10 year life and come with the unit.  There is an override button for the claxon - thank goodness!  One will wake up half a neighborhood.  VERY loud, VERY piercing.  But you want that.  My guess is it's louder than a car horn or drilling on a street and maybe even your smoke alarm.  There is a tamper proof button so that children can't accidentally turn it off..  It can also turn sideways - 90 degrees -  in the electric socket which is nice.  It has a small light on the front which should stay green for 10 years.It comes with a fair amount of paperwork.  Optimally, you would be able to fold away a cheat sheet and slip it onto or into the device.  But that is not possible.  The main points; how to turn it off, when to replace it, what do the beeps mean are scattered in the document.  But in the end, if an emergency happens, you won't need them and in a non-emergency you'll probably just rip it from the wall and remove the batteries and go look for where you filed the paperwork. :-)You are supposed to test it regularly - as much as you do your smoke alarm.  And vacuum it on occasion if you remember.  That's about it.  But it can save your life, so the expense is worth it.  Besides, the thing lasts for 10 years!  So the price is less than $2/year.  SO worth it!

  Have used these for over 20 years and since they only last 7-8 years (now 10) I continue to buy.  They do work as I had one near boat batteries I was recharging in basement and it went off.  Turns out charging lead-acid batteries gives off  Hydrogen gas which also sets off the alarm - learned something new.  I bought one of the more expensive with LCD display; waste of money.  I never looked at it and was really only interested in if it went off.  I have 4 in house.

  I got three of these alarms and they all seem to work really well. When you pull the tab for the backup battery, you should hear a loud beep to indicate it is working and that the batteries are properly detected. When plugged into the wall, it'll have a constant green light. When running on backup, it'll flash the green light every 60 seconds to indicate that it is still working and it'll flash red when the backup battery is low on power and needs replacing. As with any CO detector, you should install them at least somewhat low to the ground and away from space heaters to prevent false positives. And as always, refer to the included safety manual for more information on the product. One last thing to note though, it does come in a clam shell though, just use a box cutter and you can get around it, but still annoying. The product itself though is great and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep themselves and/or their family safe.

  Replaced three expired CO detectors in my home with these. They are LOUD, which is good for many reasons. They’re also unobtrusive, were very easy to install and have a 10-year service life as well as a battery backup in case we lose power. I chose the Kiddes over the comparable First Alert model because the Kiddes have a 10-year service life vs. First Alert’s 7-year service life.These units are simple and no-frills, which is what I wanted/needed. In my case I didn’t see a need to purchase fancy units with screens that give a read out of how many PPM of CO are in the ambient air - if there’s enough CO in the house to trigger an alarm, I’m leaving the house and calling the fire department instead of staying inside to check the readout.Would highly recommend these. They’re cheap insurance if nothing else and could potentially save the lives of you and your loved ones.

  I guess this is the kind of product you really don't know how well it works with but I haven't woken up dead yet so I guess it is working. I have seen what carbon monoxide can do to people. I have about two battery-powered ones and 210 V plug-ins in my house. I live in a single-story ranch house but I certainly don't want to take any chances. You have to change these things every 5 to 8 years for sure I don't care how long the battery lasts.

  At some point my dog decided that pooping in the house is the best revenge for me having a job which results in her  only going to the dog park once per day. She is way too smart for her own good and gets a little vindictive. Anyways, maybe once a month or so she will poop on the only carpet rug in the entire house.One awful day this happened while I was at work and before Sir Sucks-a-Lot (my robovac) did it's usually round of cleaning. As you can imagine this is definitely not a good mix. My usually reliable friend Sir Sucks-a-Lot went from sucking up dirt and pet hair to a one-day contract as a dog poop steamroller and paved the entire rug. IT. WAS. AWFUL. I smelled it as soon as I came into the house. The sight was way worth than the smell. My once green and white rug was now paved brown with the revenge of my best friend. I spent hours de-pooping and shampooing the rug. Once I was finished, I spread the odor eliminator over the carpet to soak up the remaining moisture (gross), and absorb the smell. 24 hours later Sir Sucks-a-Lot returned to his day job and vacuumed up the odor-absorbing powder and my left my run smelling great and looking good as new.I highly recommend for anyone with a pet who disrespects their rugs or carpet by pooping inside.

  The fragrance is so overpowering as to create nausea!  I have always trusted Arm & Hammer so I bought this product to eliminate an unknown stale odor in a room that is otherwise thoroughly clean.  I was overwhelmed by the fragrance!  It was so obnoxious I had to do the process again (twice) with plain old baking soda AND run an electrostatic air cleaner for 2 days.  Now the fragrance is still present but a little more livable.  But I still have 2 and a half boxes that will now go into the trash.

  Holy hell. I feel it is my duty to leave a review as a warning and to mitigate the high ratings this is getting. I had very high hopes - baking soda and Oxi-clean - what a winning combination, right? Wrong. Or who knows? I can't tell you if this product worked because the perfume smell is absolutely overwhelming.I applied this very sparingly, waited 15 minutes as directed, and vacuumed. Then I vacuumed again. And again. And turned the air purifier on ""high"". Because the smell was overpowering me. I even opened windows in 40 degree weather to help with the smell. It didn't help. Sadly, the first room I tried this in was my bedroom, as my dog sleeps on a mat at the foot of my bed. So I had to sleep with this smell. Well, I didn't sleep. It was so strong it was waking me up all night. My dog even pawed at the bedroom door at 2AM like he needed to do his business, but I'm pretty sure he just wanted to escape the perfume smell (I believe another reviewer called it old lady perfume, which is pretty accurate).It has been 36 hours since application, and it still stinks. I'm wondering if I will sleep tonight. Or maybe I'll move to the couch. Honestly, something advertising as a combination of baking soda and Oxi-clean should be awesome and smell either close to odorless or else the lightest detection of ""fresh breeze"" or something. Great cleaning combination that they totally dropped the ball on scent-wise. Maybe they changed the original formula and the great reviews are for a previous version?Really, stay away from this. It is headache inducing. Let me know if you reformulate this to remove the perfume Arm & Hammer, and I'll happily try it again. For now, the rest is going in the trash.

  These are much smaller than I expected...about 2/3 the size that I buy in the stores.  The other problem is that the spout is one big opening.  Other times when I’ve used this product the opening is designed so that I can “sprinkle” on carpet- not this.  I do not recommend this product

  Our dogs like to lay on the living room rug and it was getting smelly. Heck, even the vacuum cleaner was getting smelly.  I would have bought a steam cleaner but we have no carpeting, only a couple of throw rugs. I was looking for something like the old Carpet Fresh and came across this product. The reviews were great and Arm&Hammer is a name I trust so I decided to give it a try. Not only did it make the rug smell great, it is visibly cleaner as well. Also, the vacuum cleaner smells nice. On top of that, right after I used it, my daughter came downstairs and said, ""Hey Dad, what did you do? The whole house smells nice!""

  If I could give this 10 stars I would!! We moved into a home where the old owners had dogs who pee'd in the bedroom. We were told the carpet was shampooed but it still stunk. We purchased this, sprinkled it on and let it sit. We vacuumed it up and no more pee smell. Prior to using this we shampooed the carpet but the smell was still there. Now our carpet smells fresh and clean a week later!! Great seller and amazing product!!

  Well, they did their jobs...I had a fire in our fireplace that was almost out, down to the coals, so I closed the damper and went to bed.  An hour later ""BEEEBEEEBEEEBEEEP.""

It woke me up and the wife.I've also had it alert to smoke from me accidentally letting a damper close while there was a full-on fire and smoke began to fill the room.

  This Alarm is a “Photoelectric”  plus carbon monoxide which is a good thing. I would only use a Photolelectric or Dual sensor , “Photo  / ION” . This is regardless of the Carbon monoxide sensor capabilities. Do not rely on an “Ion” alarm to warn you of smoldering or smoke until it’s a breathing and moving fire. In other words , if you wait until it senses heat/fire, the smoke may have rendered you incapacitated, and it won’t help at that point. This detects “Smoke” and carbon monoxide, which is in my opinion the safer and gives you ample warning. check you tube or with the fire departments to make your own choice. Living in Florida we occasionally run a generator following Hurricanes and Tropical storms, so it’s a must to have the carbon monoxide feature.I tested both alarms myself with a smoke bucket, I was never able to trigger the ION alarm with smoke only in my test. Watch a few YouTube videos on the difference in alarm sensors.....1 year update,, no quality issues what so ever, and I own 4 of these. The only occasional announce is that  if my bathroom door is open following a steamy shower, this detector is near within a few feet of the bathroom door, and will trigger a brief alarm. This only happens if we forget to run the exhaust fan in the bathroom. To be honest I’m okay with this occasional annoyance reminds me how well it works. Over cooking has only caused a false alarm when we burnt a bag of popcorn in the microwave so it’s a good balance of sensitivity.

  Would give this product a 0 if I could. My husband and I ordered it in August with our baby due in September. Now, in October, with the detector only two months old and our baby girl only a month old, we thought something smelled just a little odd. We called our gas company after quickly leaving the house and when they got there they said we had a serious CO2 leak... that if it would’ve happened while we were asleep we may not have woken up... all of this and the DETECTOR DIDNT MAKE A SOUND. The gas company employee placed the device that he used to measure CO2 directly next to this detector and said it was measuring just as high there as it was in the rest of the house. Can you imagine how it would’ve impacted our newborn if we hadn’t got out of the house quickly???!!!! Do yourselves a favor, save your lives, and buy a different product!!!!!!

  A close friend of mines family here where I live in Connecticut, many years ago lost 3 children under the age of 10 in a devastating co tragedy.(you can look it up. Suffield,Ct. 1993) Carbon monoxide is nothing to screw around with.I am in the middle of some big renovations to my 100 year old home. I already have a smoke detector in every bedroom and co detector near my furnace. Building inspector came in the other day and “suggested” some additional ones. So I am adding one in the new finished basement, one on each of the two upper floors and replacing the older unit by the furnace. But I’m $5k over budget now and hardwiring in a 100 year old house is obscene. So I went with these.Please people, don’t mess around. These are pretty damn cheap insurance. Just do it. Now. You know you will be glad you did. I am. I’m actually grateful to the inspector, he got me off my butt.These are inexpensive but very reliable and dependable units. Will take you about 5 minutes to install. What my local fire department recommended. I want to sleep soundly and most importantly, wake up with my whole family.Thanks for reading

  The construction is good and solid, and does an excellent job of blocking sound. Note, this is not an ""active"" noise suppression system...this is effectively just a very well made passive earmuff hearing protection device with the ability to pair via bluetooth to hear music, podcasts, etc from a phone. While it does have a microphone, that mic is so you can have a conversation via your phone while wearing the earmuffs, not for someone wanting to talk to you standing next to you...you'll have to take them off to have an immediate local conversation.So, if used for listening to your phone's MP3's on an airplane for example, this is excellent...fidelity is quite good, and you can save a lot of money over other ""noise cancelling"" devices. Or, used when mowing the lawn, or other loud activities to preserve your hearing.If you use this while shooting, it will limit your situational awareness, just like regular earmuffs would do. You will not be able to hear people talk clearly around you, for example (again, just like regular 'muffs). And...you could listen to your music on the range, but that will reduce situational awareness even more.I bought this for listening to my phone while on a plane (It's REALLY good for that...you will be surprised at how loud you have to listen through ""regular"" headsets vs this one), and when using gas operated lawn equipment.Controls are simple and straightforward...one easy to find button on the side. A long press to turn it on or off. A double press for initial pairing. A double press to advance forward a track. Three presses to back up. Just one button. Volume control would be done on the device you are playing through, there are no volume controls on the Worktunes Connect 'muffs themselves.Charging is easy, and an LED indicator will show full charge. The device will also ""speak"" to you when it is powered on, powered off, paired, and can tell you the basic charge of the battery.There is an aux 1/8"" jack if you want to connect to a device via a cable vs bluetooth. The box comes with just the hearing protector, and a microUSB cable. No USB charger is included, you have to supply your own.

  UPDATE: I bought these in November 2017 it's now March 2019 and they are still working like a champ battery life is still very good (3 day's before I get notified through the earmuffs that the battery is low) sound quality is still perfect for music but not so much for phone calls you sound too distant and noisy to the person you are talking to but I can hear them pretty good but again I bought this headset to listen to music not for phone calls and for that reason I am very satisfied with this purchase and gave it the 5th star up from the initial 4 star rating.I highly recommend you buy this set and shop around for the 3M clips that snap into your hardhat and if they ever clunk out on me I'm buying it again without hesitation.I'm so glad I found this head set even though I had to remove the strap that goes over your head and placed it on the helmet clips from a different set then after I just tucked the wire away on the inside of the helmet where nobody could see it and BAM! super sneaky nobody can tell it's a Bluetooth headset especially if you work in a union factory who says listening to music is a safety risk get the hell out of here with that, now I can listen to music all day no problemo plus I have a earbud connected to my work radio/walkie so I can ear if I'm being called on the radio.  I tried connecting my work radio directly to the Bluetooth headset using the axillary port but it sounds muffled/distant also when I get a phone call I have to use my hand and cover up the axillary / charging port otherwise I get a ton of feedback from my surroundings (minus one star) but I'm not complaining because my goal was to be able to listen to music discreetly without the union babies finding out and make my 8-12 hour shifts more enjoyable.They hold a charge really good so far three days (two 12's and an 8) minus lunch and breaks plus I don't have the music at full volume so that helps too.

  For many years now I have used the blue colored heat transfer tape.  It has always worked well and given me no trouble.  I purchased the gold colored tape because I felt the bright contrast may be easier to see.  Well, yes, it's easier to see but the tape is so thin it is very difficult to remove once heated - and not heated for that matter.  I think I also prefer a wider tape. I obviously didn't check the width before purchasing.  I suppose I will throw it in my ""in case I run out"" drawer and go back to the blue heat tape.  Not the seller's fault, I just prefer a thicker tape as it's easier to remove after being heated.

  Wish I had discovered this stuff earlier!  I used today for the first time and it made making shirts with HTV and my heat press much easier. I was able to tape different colors for the same shirt together making the process quicker. Tape was easily removed and left absolutely no residue on my shirt. Also, some HTV transfer sheets (like for glitter) aren’t very sticky. I will be able to tape the sheet down to my shirt to ensure it doesn’t move during transport to the heat press.

  Love this tape! It is a must have if you make shirts, hats, or anything with htv or sublimation. (Or use a heat press for any reason) also if you do htv shirts or anything with htv and have diff layers to press you can use the same pieces of tape over and over. (I like to squeeze every penny out of a product lol) but I’ve never had an issue using the same pieces of tape I start with throughout layering all the colors on one shirt. will reorder when I need more!

  I have used this product for over a year and I did not have this problem n hand when heat pressing a child t-shirt. I immediately had to order this product. I prefer this width.

  So far I have no complaints. I have been using this with HTV with my heat press on fabrics to stabilize designs before pressing. I can use the pieces of tape multiple times before they lose stickiness which is a plus. I haven't seen any residue or anything on my garment after using the tape. There's not a ton to say about the tape other than it is doing it's job effortlessly and successfully. Highly recommended

  I use this tape for holding together bundles of automotive wires, versus using electrical tape that leaves behind a residue; I also use it to protect the wires when applying heat-shrink.  While the tape is a little on the thin side, it doesn't rip apart easily and holds together well -- maybe a bit more adhesion, but that's just personal preference.

  If you are looking to REMOVE CAULK, get whats called a ""Painter's Tool"", far superior to this tool.  If you are looking for a tool to FINISH CAULK (improve the edges), get a ""DAP CAP"".  Although this kit contains lots of sizes for finishing caulk, grout, etc., it's cheaply made, inadequate for removing tough caulk, and did not do as good a job ""finishing"" as the DAP CAP.

  I bought this 3 in 1 Silicone Caulking Tools and really if you have issues with having caulk on your finger then just wear a pair of latex gloves. I just use my bare finger and then wipe it off. It's so much easier to wipe the caulk off my fingers than to wipe off it off from the tool. If you want to have that ease of peeling like in the video then you still need to tape the section your caulking so there's not time save there. Even though it's only 8-9 dollars, I find this to be a complete waste of money. The only good part of the tool is the caulk remover but it's still a uncomfortable to use because of the moving silicone caulk piece and the scraper. The edges of the scraper will some time poke your hand. In my opinion is better to just buy a paint scraper, it'll have more uses than this.I tried using this tool and what would have taken me 5-10 minutes using my finger took me an hour to clean all the mess from the tool and silicone tips. It also took a long time to remove the excess caulk that was pushed along the tile. With all the excess caulk, I still got a ton on my fingers. It just isn't worth it.Also, I don't often log on to give bad reviews. This may be my first 1-star review, and it gets this because the tool may actually make the work more difficult and time consuming.

  I had to re-do some caulking around 2 bathrooms as well as some external door frames.  I bought this little tool to make the process go more smoothly and I am so glad that I did!The scraper quickly and easily removed the old caulking from all the surfaces and worked so much better than tools I have used before.  It was so much easier to scrape out the old stuff.I then used the opposite end with the rubber spatula attachments to smooth out the applied new caulking.  It made a clean and smooth line on tile, marble, and wood services.  This baby makes my work look much more professional than what I have done before.It’s also super cheap!

  It seems like every time I caulked in the past, it never quite got smooth. The multi point tool is tremendous and allows you to easily smooth the joint. It works like a squeegee in getting off extra caulking from unintended places. I didn't even need to tape...it came out much better than when previously taped, since the tape left a line/joint. This was perfectly smooth. It was so easy I did 3 places in the house already!I don't know what the blue pieces are for as there are no instructions.Great kit and reasonably priced!

  This caulking toolbaet works on Silicon tape caulking strip.Even though I didn't intend to use it on silicon strip but in regular caulk I changed my mind after receing it.When I did use the silicon strip, it worked like a charm. Reduced all the mess of caulk gun, etc..It was easy to caulk and remove the remaining debit without any additional tools.Value for money and great for silicon tape caulking.

  Overall I like this caulk tool set. My only real complaint is that there is a piece that slides over another (so you can change tools) but there should be a locking mechanism to hold it in place. Too often it would slide up when I wasn’t trying to use that part. However, I really like the metal blade. The tool I had before (that this replaced) was plastic and broke easily. This removal tool made everything SO much easier.

  For the price i was amazed how durable it was. Hesitant because it was not a brand name that i am use to. For the cheap price why not go for it. Upgraded my bathroom and this just made it easier for me with all the options. I would recommend for your next or current projects

  I have done bathroom caulking before with a flat head screwdriver and cleaning supplies and I remember it took forever and told myself I’d never do again. But, our new house needed the caulking done so I bought this tool and OMG! It was amazing and only had to use this one tool. Made the project much faster and way easier. I would recommend over and over again.

  I just have to write a review on this!  We just bought a house and the previous owner and his adult son were quite lazy when it came to cleaning up spills.  The very light carpet was stained from dumped drinks so I immediately had the carpet professionally cleaned and I actually watched him using stain removing products which did not work.  I ordered this Folex spot remover based on the high reviews.  With fingers crossed, I used it on the carpet stain.  I actually put on a latex glove and I worked it down into the carpet because the carpet is a short, tight plush pile so it didn’t seem like it was getting down in there.  I did this for about 5 minutes and then I covered with an old towel and stepped on it.  I then just walked away leaving the towel in place.  I came back about 10-15 minutes later, lifted the towel, and OMG, it was GONE.  Completely gone!!  This gentleman had also left a dining room set and all of the chairs were stained, one being particularly bad with what appeared to be spilled coffee or cola into the seat and then just left there.  I have no doubt this stain had been there for many years and I had absolutely NO hope whatsoever that it would come out but decided to give it a try anyway after what it had done to the carpet stain.  I did the same thing, sprayed very heavily onto the seat and allowed it to soak in for about 15 minutes before covering with a towel and just leaving it.  I actually had forgotten about it and left the towel on over night.  The next morning I remembered and lifted the towel and I just couldn’t believe my eyes.  It too was completely gone.  I just had to post pics of this because it was truly unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product enough.

  A few years ago I lied to myself when purchasing my Subaru Forester and thought I could keep my nice, light platinum interior clean. For those who are unaware, Subaru has a very light grey interior color offering that's called ""platinum"". When new, it is beautiful- light, happy, clean looking. If Joanna Gaines designed the interior of a vehicle, I think it would feature this color.At some point, somehow, even though we have no children, a stain appeared on my back seat despite my best efforts to completely cover any and all upholstery I could. I tried oxi clean, I tried vinegar and baking soda, both to no avail. I had resigned myself to needing to pay for a full detail of my car, until I saw a car detailing video on youtube in which they used this product. So I thought hey, why not! $16 for this vs hundreds for a detail? I'll try it. And surprise! It worked great!!Tips for using this product:-Spray more than you think you need. Dont be bashful, spray a good amount.-agitate more than you think you need. In the video I watched, the guy used a detailing brush to work this in (instead of fingers like the instructions state). I just used a cheap soft bristled paint brush from walmart.**you want to spray enough of this on where when you agitate with the paint brush, there is a slight foam.-when you think you have agitated enough, go at it some more-blot when doneSome of the reviews here say it works better if you leave your towel on it for a bit- the spot on the seat I was trying to clean was vertical so I could not test this theory but it's worth a shot.The first time I tried using this, I didnt use enough product or agitate enough. When I was done I blotted and walked away for a bit and I swear the stain looked worse when I got back, I assume because the product was lifting the dirt. I sprayed again (using more than last time), and agitated again (more than last time) and when I was done the stain had vanished!Ultimately a great buy, worth the money to give it a shot on your own interior!!

  I have rental property and a renter just moved out. The carpet looks as if they missed their mouth more times than they made it with their coca cola. So, I decided I need something that was a little stronger than regular over the counter stuff. I found this product, Folex. It sounded good and wasn't terribly expensive. I decided to try it. Well, it doesn't work worth a lick. Yeah, the spot disappears alright, while you are spraying it, then as soon as it drys, its right back again. Just so everyone knows, the photo taken above was after I sprayed those spots twice and literally emptied an entire bottle on them. I have a real funny video we did in our first use of this product. We were hoping it worked really well and then i could have posted it. Oh well, sometime you try and succeed, sometimes you try and fail. Its what makes the world go around.

  Before I begin, let me say that we primarily purchased this product for use on stains generated by a new puppy.  Folex was recommended to us by a professional carpet guy.  For very recently ""made"" pet stains this stuff is awesome!  It very thoroughly removes the staining substance, dries quickly, does not alter the color of the carpet/fabric and best of all, has no smell itself.  For me it was bad enough having my home's carpet violated by our new mongrel, but the thought of my home smelling like said violation + some cleaning product was very unappealing.  Enter Folex, it works great on pet stains, cleans the area (which I have double checked with my OCD-approved UV-blacklight) and leaves no odor of anything behind.  It is the best I have found.As for set in stains, it works well but it is not a miracle product- that said I am not sure anything is.  Due to the fact that this worked so well on pet stains, I got ambitious and tried it on all the nagging stains I had in my beige carpeted upstairs bedrooms.  One was a rust stain I made several years ago when I absent-mindedly placed a rusty bolt directly on the carpet while installing a ceiling fan; that stain came out 5 out of 10.  The other was from when I stepped on a rogue eyeliner shaving from my bathroom floor that imbedded in my sock and got on my master bedroom carpet as I left the bathroom.  That stain was about a year old and it came out 8 out of 10.Overall, Folex is terrific for new stains and pretty good for set in stains.  The price here, especially for the two pack, was way better than the store as well.  Hope this helps and good luck.

  Bought two of these to hang brooms and mops, this item was listed as an ""Amazon's Choice"" so it seemed like a safe bet. I have single holders but wanted something to hang multiple items together and this seemed like the solution. With this hanger, it is nearly impossible to get the handles into the holders. You have to hold the piece in with one hand and then shove the handle into the holder. The location of the holes for screws also makes it difficult to sink screws into the wall at the correct angle. Not worth the money or the hassle. Not sure how this product possibly has over 5k great reviews when it doesn't function properly in the one way it is to be used.

  What should have been a 5 minutes install became a 30-minute, rage-inducing carnival of mayhem.To start off, the first two screws stripped despite having drilled pilot holes into a stud and using a soft torque. Then the anchors would not fit in a 1/4"" hole and the next size up was too big, so the screws spun the anchors in the wall. Yet were someone still anchored enough to NOT release from the wall. Thus leaving me with a strip-screwed, mal-anchored piece of garage hanging in my garage. Now there are six large holes in my wall, the Home- It Mop and Broom Holder is in three pieces in my trash can, and I am writing this review.All this despite having installed dozens of things far more complicated that this little POS such as closet units, laminate floors and most recently, ceiling mounted storage racks.Stay away, unless you too, wish to have every flavor of nightmare.TLDR: hardware is substandard and worse than unusable.

  This product doesn't work for what I needed and wanted. The image makes this unit look like a nice grey color with a simple, modern look. In person, the color is a dirty beige grey and it looks like a piece of junk plastic from the 80's. But, it goes in a utility closet... so if it functions well then I can overlook that it's so ugly. However, there are many design changes I would suggest:- The 5 different broom/mop holders need to be spaced further apart (the current spacing means everything is too crowded looking and hard to access each tool and I'm only using 4 of the broom/mop holders and zero of the hooks).- The unit isn't far enough from the wall to accommodate many types of modern brooms/mops that feature wider handles. For example, I have hardwood floors and use the Bona Mop and it keeps falling off this organizer because the width of the Bona handle and the angle of the mop head requires the Bona to be pushed into this organizer at a diagonal this unit isn't designed to hold items at an angle.- I had hoped to hang my Dyson Cyclone v10 vacuum from this unit and this unit cannot accommodate the thickness of the Dyson vacuum.- I would prefer a product that comes in a few standard color options (I would want white) and the option to hold wider (diameter) products (like the Dyson) and I would make this product stand an extra half inch from the wall to accommodate handles on some mops (like the Bona Mop).- I would prefer the option of being able to purchase this product as a strip of mop/broom holders (like this current model) or purchase individual holders, so I can by 1 or 10 if needed and then I can determine the necessary distance between each product being organized on the wall.

  The wall mounted holder works well, nothing slides down (so far) and the storage seems secure.  My only suggestion to make this a 5-star product would be to have a small tab to push up the spring mounted arms that hold your items in place.  I don't have an issue loading or unloading a handle, but my Wife does.  She complains that the springs are too strong (but they need to be).  She can get things out of the organizer but leaves me to put them back :) .  Rather than use the supplied hardware I used wallboard anchors that are a bit more substantial.  With six of these holding up the Mop and Broom holder, it's not going anywhere.  We purchased two organizers: one to mount one behind the door to the laundry/mud room for mops, booms, a hardwood floor sweeper and a yard stick.  The second will go in my garage to store a broom, scrub brush, paint roller handles and a push-broom.  It's difficult to see it on the product photos on Amazon but there are also six flip down hooks, they aren't heavy duty but rather a nice place to hang light-weight items.  If you are looking for a way to get similar items off your floors and out of corners, this has item has met my expectations and then some.

  I really wanted to love this!  Installation was easy with simple power tools.  Screws and plastic wall anchors were included.  We mounted this in our utility closet, and after putting my duster handle in for the first time, the rubber ""wheel"" that holds in handles broke off and the spring fell in the floor!  I am really disappointed in this product that it broke the first time I used it.  Too bad we've already drilled holes in the wall or I would try a different brand.  I've also had it for several months before we got around to installing it, or I would return it.  We still have room for 4 handles, but I wonder how long they will last.  I wouldn't recommend this product.

  I have a small apartment and the broom closet was always a mess with the brooms hitting me in the face whenever I took the trash out. This saved me so much stress! The slots have little rollers and they move to fit just about any size mop or broom. There are also little hooks that can drop down if you want to hold towels or the dust pan, which is what I use it for. This is a must-have organizational tool!

  I wish I'd purchased this sooner.  It works great and was easy to install.  I held it up against the wall, placed a small level on top to ensure it was straight, used a pencil to mark the center of each screw hole, installed anchors, and screwed in.  It gives me warm fuzzy feelings when I see it because everything looks so organized!Note: I had an issue with my broom sliding down through the grips.  Weight-wise, it was the lightest thing I tried to hang; there were no issues with the heavier items.  Wrapping a rubber band around the handle solved the problem (see photo of yellow broomstick handle).

  This is an honest review of this item, which I purchased full price on Amazon.com:So far, I'm impressed with the build quality, but not so much with the power...I often times think people get to focused on the advertised ""MPH"" on the box..don't be fooled!For my application (Blowing dust and some grass clippings off of my driveway) this blower is perfect. Its light weight, built well and its very affordable. If you find yourself cleaning up a larger area or heavy debris, I would recommend  buying a different model. I would classify this as a light use model.This is my second Black+Decker blower I have owned. I inherited a 25 year old one from my dad that just went out. If I can get that much use out of this one Id be happy.

It is lightweight, comparative to others and powerful enough for the leaves I've been gathering. A big guy would likely want something more powerful/heavy duty. But this one is short enough I don't have to lift up to use. Can use at normal arm level.

  You never really know how much easier a job can be until you make a change. I really wanted something lighter and smaller, and this fit the bill perfectly. This blows stronger than my gas powered blower. It's light, and very easy to handle. I would use this for any job where I would use a corded blower. When I have to blow in a larger than a 100' area, I use my gas blower. The tone it generates is not a high tone, which can be hard on the ears. This is not quiet, I would say, but its the tone that makes all of the difference. It's a lower tone, definitely not shrill. For the money, you can't go wrong.

  I started out wanting a  Green Works cordless blower because I already had a Green Works mower and could interchange the batteries, but could not find one powerful enough at a reasonable price.

2,TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,"ZeroWater 5-Stage Replacement Filter, 2-Pack, White",NA,5,"
  If you are reading about this Zero Water Replacement Filters, you probably have the Zero Water Pitcher or the Dispenser.  If you filter drains slowly, it can be fixed.  The problem is that the filter probably has a big air bubble inside and prevents the water to drain through.Just tap the filter and sometimes the bubble would break into smaller bubbles and release through the two holes. If that does not do it, try using a small blunt object and wiggle the membrane underneath.  Be careful not to puncture the membrane.  This should release most of the air trapped at the top of the filter.  Once the air is released, the filter would drain properly.To prolong the use of the filters, I use two dispensers.  I filter the water twice.  I use the filter that is at or above 6 as the first filter.  Since my tap water is more than 200, my first filter would drop this down by a large number even though it would be above 6.  My second filter thus is filtering water that is way below the tap water reading.  When the second filter read above 6, I used it as my first filter and replace the first filter with a new one.  The new filter always filters the water on the 2nd time.  It is a little work but I prolong the life of the filter.Yes, I love the Zero Water, the water tastes good enough for someone like me that does not like to drink plain water.Update.New stock for Zerowater filter has blue seal and is fused to the filter.  The old stock is just a black 0-ring.  Both seems to filter the same.  The Blue seal one comes with a cap. I found out why, read on.The first two Filters from my recent 12 pack order seems to be fine but when I opened the third one, there was water dripping out of a new filter.  There was even condensation on the cap.  I sent an email to Zerowater and inquired about this condition.Following is what came back from Customer Service: -Thank you for contacting ZeroWater. Before the carbon is added to the filters it is washed. The cap has been added to retain that moisture to prolong filter life. The filter is safe for use.Thank you,JoshCustomer Service SupervisorZeroWaterSo, this is the reason that the newer stock filters are coming with caps.  The caps are keeping the moisture in the filters.

  Something is going on with the filters I purchased on Amazon, Initially for the first year I purchased Zero Water filter directly from their website and they last about 20 to 30 days in my household. After they stop shipping to Hawaii (about 9 month ago) I bought my filters on Amazon and notice that the life of ALL the filters (I purchased a 12 Pack) was only 10 days!!!). I do not know what is going on , but after reading some reviews on the website it is obvious something is not OK with the filters and they need to either come clean on advertising this filters as recycled and/or make better filters. I will look for other brands because it has become excessively pricy having to change my filter 3 times a month.

  Ok, I love my zero water filter system, what I don’t love is being swindled. I bought the 2 pack of filters as back up for when I would need to replace my filter. Tonight was that night. As I opened the first sealed bag and opened the blue top there was water and the filter was wet! I asked my husband if he thought that was normal he said open the other sealed filter, so we opened that one up as well and guess what?! it was dry!!  So out of dumbfounding curiosity we tested both filters and of course....  the one with water had been used! The reading came back as 002 and the dry filter came back as 000. This is not ok! And since I ordered this back in June, I don’t really can’t take any actions except for  writing this review. I really hope this was a one time screw up and not something that is happening with others.

  These filters only last about a week, week and a half! If you are lucky you can get two weeks out of them. You will be constantly spending money and reordering these, repeatedly throwing out giant plastic filters as well as the packaging they come in multiple times a month if you purchase the Zero Water Dispenser System. I have to admit that during the first week to week and a half that you have installed them, they will be great! They will work fine and the water will taste great and you will get a 000 reading on your meter. Then, seemingly overnight, your water will taste awful (worse than from the tap, as if there is mildew or something off) and when you measure it with the meter you will get a very high reading.What's upsetting is that the company is aware of this but you won't find out until after you purchase and use it. When I replaced the first filter, I saw that the packaging addressed the issue. I didn't see it on the filter that came with the dispenser unit. It said that if you are replacing your filters often then there is an issue with your water and to call a number to ask about a discounted filters ""program"". A friend who bought the same unit and filters as I did, based on my premature and naive recommendation, called the company and was told that, yes, the filters wear our very quickly for people who live in areas with certain water conditions. They didn't offer help past that. Great. My friend has already set up a delivery water service and I will be doing the same. It is much cheaper per month than replacing these filters and will save on wasted materials in the long run.I recommend NOT purchasing these and looking into other options. We are in a rental home and cannot install a permanent filtration system but there are home water delivery options!

  I bought these for use with my Keurig K-40 Coffee Maker. They work great, and are a great value. Highly recommended.After cleaning my Keurig recently and inserting a new water filter, I was chagrined to discover that the coffee maker wasn't working properly -- it didn't seem to be priming properly and would whir and whir endlessly, with no output.After a bit of troubleshooting, I realized that air was trapped in the water filter assembly, and was apparently causing the pump not to prime properly. So here's a tip: Follow the directions for preparing a new water filter (soak at least five minutes in tap water and rinse to remove any loose charcoal particles). Then when inserting into the water reservoir, gently ""tilt"" the filter assembly to near-horizontal. This will allow any air trapped in the filter assembly to escape (evidenced by bubbles). Finally, re-affix the filter to the intake on the bottom of the water reservoir and you should be good to go.

  At first I was hesitant to buy these filters after reading some reviews about the water being gray. But I decided to bite the bullet and just try them. The directions say to soak the filter in water for 15 minutes. I gave it a few minutes longer, at 20 minutes just because. And that was the only time the water was a little gray, but that was obviously because the charcoal filter was just soaking in the bowl. But after testing it, the water going through the Keurig was totally fine.I think for those who had gray water it was probably because they either didn’t soak it long enough, or maybe they need to clean out their Keurig too every once in a while. I know everyone’s experience differs, but I just wanted to share my positive experience with those who may be hesitant like I was!Plus, a 12-pack for a great deal. These will last me 2 years before I have to order another pack (change out every 2 months obvs). Awesome!

  So far the first one I’ve used devoloped what looked like rust after making about 5 cups of coffee. So, that being said, one star till further notice. Maybe that one was a dud. Let’s see.Follow up review:Well I went through ALL the filters and each and every single one developed what I guess is rust. Don’t know why. Metal in the filters? Never heard of charcoal developing rust. So I wouldn’t recommend these filters.

  These filters are good quality filters, they haven't given my keurig any problems at all, they fit exactly like the keurig brand filters. After soaking and rinsing until the black run off is gone, they worked great.  I would definitely recommend these

  I purchased these filter as it was time to replace mine. The instructions are written on the outside of the package and are very easy to follow. The instructions say to soak he filter for 30 minutes but I soaked the filter for about an hour. I place the filter in a bowl of water and did some other things around the house and just was side tracked. Lol.  When I came back to changing the filter, I took it out and rinsed it for 30 seconds like the instructions said and put the filter into my Keurig 2.0 coffer maker. At no time was there any black stuff in the bowl or when I rinsed the filter. I even squeezed the filter a little to be sure and no black stuff came out. It fit the filter holder perfectly and the coffee I made immediately after changing the filter tasted just fine.I also looked at my old filter which came with the coffee maker and the one I was putting in side by side. I could see no difference so they seem to be well made.

  Received the 12 pack of filters on time. All 12 filters were in perfect condition (no broken seams or charcoal dust) and individually wrapped. Followed the instructions of soaking for 15 minutes followed by rinsing under running water for 30 seconds. Replaced the old filter with the new one (a perfecr fit) and ""Viola"" a perfect cup of coffee from my Keurig. If I didn't know better I would think these were the Keurig brand.

  I have used both the original White filter and the animal Yellow filter. I have 2 dogs who shed a lot, and have my bedroom and living room in the basement. I bought this air purifier because I have asthma and our older purifier just wasn't working for me anymore. I have had asthma flair ups being in the basement because, like any basement, it can get damp and has poor circulation. We run a dehumidifier and 3 tower fans during the summer and it helps.I did not notice any significant differences between the original filter and the animal filter. They both worked the exact same to me with one being a little more expensive. I would say, if you are thinking about getting the animal over the original, just get the original.

  Perfect filter replacement for my fan. Old one was pretty dang gross, this one was great. I have a cat with cat allergies, and I just use the original plain old filter. Works great for me! I don’t feel that I need the pet one, this one gets the job done.

  If you’re dealing with forest fire smoke go for the blue toxin filters. I’ve taken photos of the original (white) filter and the green toxin filter after cutting them open.I wanted to see if there was a difference, and there is. The toxin filter has about 2-3x the activated carbon.

  It works fantastic.  couldn't believe what I pulled out of that filter after only one week.  There was so much hair. dander and who knows what.  I have a litter box in my bedroom for my cat,  after seeing what could have ended up in my lungs, I was in shock.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe Im still alive, after seeing all those pollutants that were captured by the filter.  Highly recommend everyone uses one of these for their own health.

  I love it.  I was doubtful that it would do...anything.  I found out i have allergies,  especially to dust mites.  Now,  i clean every week, and am pretty tidy, but i figured what the heck.  I've been using this in the bedroom (12 x 14) for a few weeks now, and i can feel and smell a difference.  I use it 24/7 on low.  It's very quiet. Easy to take apart.

  This is a must have for the home! The filter to the right is 5 months old. With fires in Colorado this year, along with the normal dust, dander and pollen in the air, we knew we had to replace our filters sooner than the usual 6-8 month recommendation. So thankful for our Levoit Air Purifiers!

  I installed 2 new filters into my machines but the red light would not turn off even though I pressed the lock button for 3 seconds. Come to find out from the Levoit people that you're supposed to press the RED filter button for it to turn off. I did that and the red light disappeared.

  Let's cut to the chase. While I like this product and I would recommend it the advertisement is a bunch of bull.I have owned this product for a few weeks. I have a little over shoulder length curly thick hair. (in case you were wondering) I tested it for a week because I wanted to give it a good amount of time to give myself an unbiased opinion.The advertisement shows hair going down the drain and getting caught in the TubShroom BUT doesn't show hair with hair product, soap, or dirt and oils from your body.  The mixture of these things actually does cause a bit of a drainage problem and after about a few days of use water began to collect at the bottom of my tub. My husband actually took it out while he showered at one point so he didn't have to stand in it. So I suggest changing it out every few days and not a week.Cleaning is also a bit difficult. Because most people shower at least once a day the TubShroom is always wet. In the ads they clean it while the hair is completely dry so it just slides right off. Well the hair product and in my case my husbands alternating shower schedule with mine keeps it wet making it a bit harder to ""Remove the hair with one effortless move.""After cleaning it I rinsed mine off with hot water and a little bit of Dawn dish soap to get off the hair product and all the other grimey stuff off. I've since put it back and have found a good schedule as far as cleaning it goes and haven't had any drainage problems since.It's a good product and I do recommend it but I do suggest considering the things that I've mentioned.

  I have to say I was a bit skeptical about this product when I first heard of it. After several recommendations from friends (and needing to find another solution for the hair clogs) I went ahead and purchased it.We are a household of 3 woman, 2 with short hair and 1 with long hair, not to mention several family member visits a month with multiple people having longer hair. Oh, and a medium haired dog that does get washed in the shower.I tried 3 other drain catchers while i was waiting for this one to arrive. None could hold up and frankly were nasty to clean out.I removed the metal catcher with a screwdriver and placed the Shroom in its place (as directed by the printed instructions on the box), at first it looked funny sticking out a bit (the instructions tell you this is normal) and my mom thought I had dropped a giant button in the shower (top view). The first shower was a grand success. Not only was the water able to properly drain (goodbye standing in a pool of your own dirty bathwater!!!!) but the hair dropped into the catcher without it collecting on the top (so it was not visible to one taking a shower). Once I was done, I didn't think it had worked since all the hair drained, little did i know it was draining into the spool. All the hair that had gone down was indeed caught and very, very simple to remove from the spool. I grabbed tissue and just ""peeled"" the hair off and threw away the trash. Voila! I don't know why I had ever hesitated. I like it so much and it is so useful, i am including it in all my housewarming gifts. It is the item you never knew you needed nor wanted. But now that i have it I am so much better for it.

  Update #2: 2.5 years later and I’ve only had to unclog the drain once, and I believe it was just because of soap scum.Update: more than a year later and I have yet to have to unclog the drain!I am one of those people who clogs the shower drains with my hair. It got to the point where I brushed my hair well before getting in and then kept a brush in the shower to wrap the excess hair in while shampooing, and would STILL clog the drain every 6 weeks or so. I've had this about 2 months now and thought I'd really test it out by no longer brushing my hair before or during the shower. No clogs! It's amazing how much this thing catches considering it's this cheap looking piece of rubber that doesn't even fit well. I will say, it's much easier (and a lot less slimy) to clean when dry. And the loose fit (& lightweight) means sometimes my cat thinks he can play with it again and I'll find it in the bedroom floor. I tell everyone I know about this thing.

  AMAZING! A must have for families with long shedding hair!!Doesn't fit snug in my tub drain but fits well enough. Once a month I used to have to use chemicals to declog our shower drain as the amount of hair coming from my long hair and my teenage daughters made it so the shower would clog up and provide us with three to four inches of standing water. It was a real pain in the butt, a constant added expense, and made the tub constantly feel and look dirty. I bought this hoping it would catch the hair as advertised causing the drain to not clog. This tiny little device is a true miracle!!! We've been using it for almost 3 months now and I have yet to need to use chemicals 2 declogged pipes as we have ZERO clogs!! I do have to remove the plug everyday to remove the hair that has collected otherwise the tub will not drain. Cleaning the plug is a nasty job as you can imagine hair soap scum Etc. The only true negative that I have found is that the in side of the plug is hard to clean as the soap scum collects to it and using a tissue simply won't clean it. About once a week I have to go in with a pipe cleaner or bottle brush to clean and sanitize the inside of the plug cylinder.***update*** its been about 6 months or so and I just purchased a new poo be. The original got too nasty. These are really hard to clean and clog up with soap scum, body fluids etc quickly. After a while its time to toss and replace. Still even with replacing 2 times a year its a bargain compared to using chemicals 4 + times a year! Product works great and I still give it 5 stars.I just wish it was easier to clean!

  I had some outlet protectors already, not sure what brand. But my 10 month old daughter figured those ones out. These ones are nice because they are discreet. They sit flush with the outlet. They aren’t distracting so my daughter doesn’t find interest in them. And they are too thin for her to pry them off. I actually kinda had trouble getting them out of one of my outlets but I find that a good thing, they are definitely child proof. Can’t beat the low price either. And they arrived very quickly.

  These are flimsy and aren’t sufficient to protect a child.  They don’t stay in the socket and could easily be pulled out.  Also, they are MADE IN CHINA by Jasco, with the notation that GE is a trademark under license to Jasco.

  We have a grandbaby that like to get into things and knows about wall plugs as we have nightlights plugged in and she see them if we forget to remove them prior to her arrival.  To have open receptacles is really asking for trouble, so like everyone else, i looked on line and at Amazon for covers.There are many to choose from and it can be a bit of a pain to go through reviews, figuring which is real, which are not, etc...I know the name GE, plus knowing they do electric light bulbs, sockets, etc..., who better to know how to prevent electrical accidents.  I bought these and am very happy with them.I wanted something simple, something that I can push in fairly easy and not too hard or easy to remove.  If it is too easy to remove, they could fall out or my grandkid could easily remove it.  Too hard to pull out and you'd have work your nails in behind it and hope you don't break a nail.  These are pretty easy to push in, fit snugly so they don't fall out and yet can be removed with just a bit of effort.  In other words, they work perfectly for us and the grandkid has yet to be able to pull them out.  She is 2 and these outlet covers do the job very well.As far as quality...hey, they are small pieces of pliable plastic but yet, not flimsy.  I'd recommend these to anyone who needs basic receptacle covers.

  Some fit right and are difficult to remove and other are very loose and can pull right out (it's not the outlet as trying different covers resulted in different fits). Ultimately, our toddler learned he could pull out some and loved playing with them. Now he is obsessed with trying to get them, the fact they draw him to the outlet really makes these more dangerous than safe!If they were consistent in size, these would be a 5 star product - but they don't. Luckily, they give you enough you can go through them to find the ones that do fit the best.Quick tip: insert them carefully as they are designed to have an up and down :)

  So, imagine for me if you will that you are a middle-aged parent with a couple of twins army-crawling around the house. Now this isn't my first time to the rodeo either; I have a few babies that I have managed to keep alive, but never more than one at a time... Whoever invented twins, well they shouldn't have. Now that I'm thinking about it, keep your eyes out, I may be starting a 'parents of twins support group'. These twins of mine may just be giving twins a bad name. They don't just dislike each other, they downright hate each other. And now that they are beginning to move/scoot around the house, paired with the hate, they prefer to go in their own directions, which makes it impossible for one grownup to keep track of them both simultaneously. And for whatever reason, baby humans come out of the womb with this uncontrollable urge to commit the most dangerous acts. One of these dangerous acts that they can't help but commit, is the urge to stick random things into other random things. And just as convenient as electricity and outlets are, they are just as equally dangerous. These are priced very fairly when you take into consideration the potential costs if a baby human were to stick a fork in their nose, and then into the outlet...

   This is quite awsome product. Of course it's cheap but not only cheap. I has function! So easy to set. Kids can't remove it. My oldest one is 6. And she will need time to remove it if she want to. So if younger kids? They can not remove for sure. And it seems nothing on there so kids can not give pay attention for that. Enought to use. I left two of them. If I need it more in the future I will buy again.

  These work perfectly for me. I am using them just as dust and water cover for my surge protector that is near a sink.In my picture you can see one didn't fit so I cut it down.  This isn't a problem because all surge protectors and outlets are spaced differently.  You can't blame the compony if some don't fit.  The good thing though is that the aren't to small.  This means you can always cut one down to fit your outlet.  Also they were very easy to cut with normal scissors.They  fit snuggly and are easy to put in and remove which is great for me but might not be good for keeping kids out.

  I got these protectors to childproof my new place. I do not think my new place has particularly large holes -  but these plugs would not stick and  is super easy to peel off.  It can stay on - so if you are only looking to make it look like the outlets are covered, sure...but it defeats my purpose of actually preventing my toddler from sticking her fingers into the holes.. hence returning!

  I will start off with the only negative, and that is the adjustment angle of the fan. You can only adjust it sideways, not up or down. Not a major issue for me, but for some with low or high windows, it may be an issue.On the low fan and the coolest setting, the 5,000 BTU unit will freeze a 150-200 sq. ft. bedroom.  The lowest fan setting is not too loud for sleeping, but I personally need white noise or the sound of a fan to sleep. It may bother people who need a quiet sleeping environment.The cost is very competitive in the market. I am comparing this to a similar Frigidaire unit. I am much more pleased with the Media. The competing unit did not keeps its Freon charge, and was much louder and less energy efficient.The Media A/C arrived earlier than expected, even during the delayed shipping times during the pandemic.It did not come with a remote control, but that is not an issue for me. The extension cord is ~5 feet, so it should reach most 3-prong outlets.Very simple assembly, no directions needed for the handy person. You WILL need a Phillips head screwdriver. Be careful not to over tighten the window brace when installing it, otherwise you will strip the threads in the A/C unit.

  The upper dial is sorta placebo. The actual cooling only has 2 settings, on and off. There's no actual levels, the cooling only kicks in when the dial is turned all the way up.So you basically have a choice between room temp air, or ICE cold. I mean this things cools like it's looking for it's super suit, and that's the only reason I didn't give a lower score. 250 sq ft limit? Yeah it'll turn your 250 sq ft into a walk in fridge if you leave it on all night.It's also LOUD. I mean if you're planning on reading a night before Christmas while this little beast is on you better have some BOSE (tm) noise cancelling headphone because this will make your eardrums wish they were not eardrums. Plus side is I can no longer hear the traffic outside my window when this thing is on.Overall 3 stars5 stars for cooling ability1 star for noise1 star for ease of control3 stars for installation (pretty standard, leaves some gaps in the windows)2 stars for air directionability (only adjust left and right, tho you can use blinds to deflect the air up and down)2 stars for filter (doesnt take regular air filters, had it's own washable meshy filter that imo isnt very filtery at all)4 stars for overall construction

  Sooooo mines didn’t bring a remote \: BUT THATS FINE! This ac was everything I ever needed. My room is in the front of my house, so sun is hitting it from 1-8pm, it was a sauna!! Even at night the heat lingered in the air and my room was the ONLY room in my house to be that hot. I was kinda doubtful that it would significantly cool down my room, but I was okay with that, I just needed it to be a bearable temperature. It was a easy set up, and pretty light for an ac. I brought it up the steps myself and I’m a 5’2 twig, can’t even do a push up. So it was light, the installation was really simple. And my room is so COLD I HAD TO TURN DOWN THE SETTINGS!!! I recommend this 100%

  Small, (reportedly) efficient and inexpensive, no frills unit. The reason I am writing this review is how quiet it is. We bought this early in the season before things got hot and before they would become harder to get, so didn’t really have the chance to test it.So I installed it yesterday, and while it’s not really heavy duty, the price tag wasn’t either and so long as we get a few years out of it, that’ll be reasonable to me. For instance the unit isn’t perfectly aligned on all the front cover and one of the metal feet is slightly skewed, but hey it’s not that big of a deal, this is a budget unit.Having waited so long I started wondering if there turned out to be anything  wrong if I’d have an issue returning it. So I finally turn it on, I hear the fan running quietly and am waiting for the relay to kick in and the compressor to flip on and raise the noise level.When this didn’t happen I started to worry. I turned it off and thinking maybe I had missed the “click” and compressor kick on, I started it again. Same. I was like “huh”? But the thing is, the air was nicely cold and knowing it was high 80’s outside I knew it had to be doing the job. Yup. It’s THAT quiet. Pretty nice honestly. Not just for ourselves but also so our neighbors don’t have to hear “brewawarreesaaawrrrrr bzzzzzzzhhhhh rawrrre” every time the unit kicks on and we all also don’t have to endure sustained loud compressor noise afterwards.This aspect alone makes this line worthwhile if they are all this way. Maybe the bigger units are louder, I don’t know. But what I do know is this is a small, economic, simple (which usually means less to break and more reliable) and effective unit for a small room.

  First of all, I got this product to cool down a room that is about 20ft by 20 ft. For that, it's wonderful. I don't even need to turn it up to full blast during a Florida summer. It is pretty loud, but for me, that's not a problem. The real problem is that there was no weeper hole.This thing was amassing tons of water, which would hit the fan, and there was no where for the water to go. I had to drill three small holes in order for the water to drain. I shouldn't have to do that.I will stipulate that it came with instructions that I did not read, but I doubt if those instructions claimed the user had to drill holes in the thing.Overall, I like it, and I would be willing to buy again.

  Strong, just like it was advertised. However, the spacing between slots is much too small. As you can see in my photo, I was able to fit 3 items reasonably well. If I were able to fit 5 items in there, they would be overlapping and look messy and jumbled. This product would be perfect if it was much longer and had 4-6 inches of space between each rake, shovel, broom, etc.

  Absolutely love this product!  I cleaned my laundry room last week and wanted to organize all my brooms, mops and even mini vacuum.  This handled the job - and then some!Installed in minutes and is very strong.  I feel comfortable with one of the items which was moderately heavy compared to the rest.  Love the added hooks, as well.See my before and after pictures...

  This thing is AWESOME. I wanted one and put it on my wish list where it sat for... months? It just wasn't high on my priority list. Finally, after a few months of battling the brooms in my cupboard one day I pulled up my wish list and there it was, waiting for me. Having had it installed for a few weeks now I can tell you- I should have bought it MONTHS AGO. I've been kicking myself for not getting it sooner.It takes about a minute to get used to, because it takes a smidgeon of force to get your brooms/mops/etc in and out of the individual grips but I acclimated to it quickly, I'm glad the grips are strong- it keeps everything exactly in place. Nothing falls or slips out. Rather than having brooms, mops, dusters falling at me every time I open my pantry now they are neatly waiting for me when I need them, not when I don't. REALLY happy with this purchase. Saves space, reduces frustration and was a great value.

  I bought two of these based on the great reviews.  What I should have done is read the critical ones because they're all telling the same story - this thing is difficult to use and pinches your fingers.  Don't get me wrong, if you had committed a crime and were trying to conceal your identity by removing your fingerprints permanently from your body, this thing would work great.  You see, the little ""rollers"" that hold the items in place don't really roll.  And the springs are so dang strong that you have to push them out of the way with your fingers to put anything in or remove from the rack.  So what does this mean?  It means that the ""rollers"" (which don't actually roll remember) snap back and pinch your fingers between the grippy rubber and the razor sharp edge of the rack body.  Great.  Just great.  Then the best part!  There is so much force required to do this action that it literally rips the hanger from the wall because the wall anchors they send are junk!  This leaves 6 large holes in your drywall, blood on the floor, and a screaming wife.  Thanks guys.  You've really been helpful here.

  Pros: Comes with a great template to make installation easy. Comes with self drilling anchors for installation on drywall. Allows the organizer to be securely mounted and handle a lot of weight safely. The overall quality is very good. The springs used to grab the handles is just the right tension to hold securely, yet not so stiff you can get the handle in. The added hooks are very handy and snap up and out of the way if you don't need them. Very clever!Cons: The heads of the screws that mount through the organizer into the hangers are very small. The mounting holes are very deep in the organizer making mounting virtually blind and requiring a long screwdriver. These things made mounting more of a pain than it had to be. I purchased 2. 1 had just enough screws and anchors the other was 2 short..Wish list: I wish it had at least 2 more handle grabs. I wish the screw heads were larger

  First off, the instructions to mount this are terrible. A vague video that doesn't even tell you whet size drill bit to use. Second, the anchor and screws they provide are terrible quality. The anchors stripped and warped as I was screwing them into the wall. One of the screws had a rogue piece of metal which prevented access to my Phillips screwdriver and the screws that I was able to get into the anchors weren't the right size as they continued to spin once screwed in. The spaces between the slots are too small so you can only really hang three things on there and they aren't strong enough to stop sweepers from sliding down to the floor. Absolute waste of money and time. Do not buy.

  Repeat customer!  I purchased 1 to organize the garden tools (rake, hoe, cultivator, shovel, etc.) in our garage and by alternating the tops of the tools up/down, was able to fit them neatly in the holder.  Liked it so much, going to install another next to it for the other items.  The hooks are a nice feature to hold our gloves and a simple plastic bag to hold things when needed.The installation kit was very helpful and was able to install without using a drill.  I know all installs are unique, but was lucky in the spot I selected in the garage, which was a wooden shelving unit.

  After getting the ultimatum from the wife to organize the garage, I had to jump on this organizer.  I was looking for something that wasn't going to cost me $70 plus to get things set in the garage. This tool organizer seems to be set to do the job.  I wouldn't hesitate to grab more of these if needed.  The one thing I was wishing was different was just a little more room between the different slots.Pro tip - alternate your handles up and down....this allows you to not have crazy overlap and space issues due to multiple rake and shovel heads hitting each other.

  I use heat guns quite often, mostly for applying heat-shrink tubing, and bending PVC tubing and pipe. For these applications, I have a couple professional heat guns by Milwaukee, with accurate digitally controlled fan speed and heat control that can be variably set and then the gun adjusts to maintain the setting. But those cost a few hundred dollars, and I wanted a couple inexpensive basic heat guns for my home shop and garage.I decided upon two different models by Seekone, the less expensive one that is the subject of this review, and a somewhat more expensive (yet still inexpensive) model that adds a digital temperature readout and solid-state setting of fan speed and temperature.So, about this very inexpensive basic model. It is a classic utilitarian device with a solid, decent quality appearance and feel. It seems like something that will hold up well to light use, but I don't know if I would either trust it for any kind of production level work, or to last for many years of regular use.The housing is all plastic, with practically the only metal visible being the hot air nozzle, which by the way is approximately 1-1/2"" diameter. The housing from the rear/base to the end of the nozzle is about 9-3/4"", the diameter of the body is about 2-3/4"", and the handle (including the power cord strain relief) extends about 7"" below the body of the gun. The heavy duty power cord is about 56"" long, and its strain relief included a loop which I presume is to allow hanging the gun on a hook (although not to be actually used that way). The gun is rated to be 1800W, and it could hardly be any more than that since that gets you to about 15A, the maximum on most 120VAC single phase power outlets. The gun is specified for 110VAC rather than 120VAC, although that should not be of great importance, and only 60Hz is mentioned, which should only influence fan speed, so I don't know if the gun's fan could be damaged, or work poorly, at 50Hz.The gun can be held, well, gun-like in one hand and aimed at the object to be warmed/heated, and the case & handle design make this mode fairly comfortable, with a good balance and other ergonomics. But the plastic is all hard, with none of the soft-finish we have become accustomed to with many power tools, so this probably makes extended use without wearing gloves somewhat uncomfortable.The other mode is to balance the gun on its rear-end/base, with the nozzle pointing up, so you can use both hands to hold the object to be heated in the air stream above the nozzle. This is a test for many heat guns in my experience, because many have a tendency to tip over, and because this can easily start a fire, they need to be closely watched when used this way. This also can show where the money was saved to get the low cost.....my Milwaukee models use something like a silicon rubber jacketed power cord with high strand count conductors inside, so the power cord is soft and floppy, with minimal stiffness, so the weight and/or stiffness of the power cord, coupled with the greater weight of the gun, make it more stable in this mode. By comparison, this Seekone gun is very light weight, and the power cord, while electrically adequate, is also inexpensively made, and is quite stiff. I found that I had to adjust the position and orientation of the gun until I found a stable place to let it balance while in use, and another other position or rotational orientation on a floor or table would result in the power cord's stiffness pulling on the low mass of the gun, so it would just fall over immediately.My Milwaukee guns have the ends of their handles at the same level as the rear base of the gun's housing when used in vertical mode, and this also helps stabilize the gun. On this Seekone gun, the handle itself cannot be used this way, but they DID include a wire bail that snaps into two holes near the end of the handle. Normally, the bail rests against the back of the handle, but you can flip it to another position where is acts to extend the handle such that it touches the same surface that the gun is balanced on, making it more stable in that direction; this does help to offset the stiffness of the power cord, at least in one direction. However, on MY gun, the wire bail was installed with its bent 'foot' on the wrong side, so the power cord would not allow it to be flipped into that ""kickstand' position....I needed to spring the bail out of its holes, and turn it around 180 degrees, and then re-install it onto the handle.The gun comes with four accessories, all of which modify the airflow out of the nozzle:- Concentration nozzle, 2"" long, reduces the normal 1-1/2"" diameter nozzle down to 7/8"" diameter- Concentration nozzle, 2"" long, reduces the normal 1-1/2"" diameter nozzle down to 1/2"" diameter- Reflector nozzle, 2"" long, redirects the air from the nozzle to one side (the shovel shaped sheet metal piece is about 1-1/2"" wide). The reflector as furnished is fairly flat, but you could potentially bend it to redirect the air differently, or even curl it around something like a dowel to make a looped shape (many other heat guns come with just such a nozzle, best for evenly heating heat shrink tubing around electrical wiring)- Deflector nozzle, 3-1/2"" long and 2-1/4"" wide, flattens the hot air stream and directs it to one side; this is probably for stripping paintThe gun has two controls:- Three position 'fan' switch, OFF, LOW, HIGH- Large temperature setting knob that actually forms the rear base of the gun (the gun rests on the knob when in vertical mode)The fan switch is pretty obvious, although it is not apparent from looking, or reading the brief users manual, if this also influences the heating element (as many other heat guns do, limiting the gun to only one heater element if the fan speed is low, and allowing both heating elements (or more) to be powered only when the fan is at a higher speed.....more on this later.The temperature knob seems to be marked backwards (and I see some other reviews saying the same thing). It seems to be showing a counterclockwise rotation for higher temperature, but that is not the case. Turning the knob clockwise increases the temperature.I did a series of tests, supporting the tip of a food grade thermometer 2"" above the end of the nozzle while the gun was in its vertical mode. I tried the gun at both LOW and HIGH fan settings, in each case with the temperature control knob fully counter-clockwise, centered, and fully clockwise:LOW Fan- CCW = 132°F- Centered = 290°F- CW = 400°FHIGH Fan- CCW = 116°F- Centered = 290°F= CW = 550°F (see below in ****)In all measurements above, I allowed the gun to run undisturbed for one minute before reading the thermometer, and then I averaged the readings over another minute to get the temperature number. In all cases, the temperature actually took at least 30 seconds to more or less stabilize, and once stabilized, the temperature cycled up and down around the average temperature, about 5°F above and below the average, i.e a 10°F fluctuation. When the temperature had settled to its low extreme, I could hear a sudden slight drop in fan speed, then the temperature would rapidly climb to the high extreme, after which the fan speed would increase slightly and the temperature would slowly drop back to the  low extreme, and the cycle would repeat. This is indicative of a thermostat-controlled heating element, in spite of the sales lingo that suggests something more elaborate, and in one place ""rheostat control"". My guess is that the temperature knob simply adjusts a thermostat set-point, and that switches the heating element on and off, nothing fancier than that.What does surprise me a little is that in the HIGH fan mode, the lowest settable temperature was lower than what I measured in the LOW fan setting, although the highest temperature was certainly higher in the HIGH fan mode. My guess is that with the heating element at its lowest power, or the thermostat's lowest sensitivity, the heater is putting out the same BTUs with the temperature knob fully counter-clockwise, but the air is blown past it faster to it does not pick up the heat quite as much. ********* I noticed that at no time did I measure anything above an average of 550°F, .......FAR from the advertised 1200°F maximum. Then I remembered that my food grade thermometer can only read up to a maximum of 600°F, although with that I would assume that I would have read UP TO 600°F instead of just 550°F. I also thought that I observed the usual thermostatic cycling around that 550°F set-point; if the nozzle temperature was actually getting up above 1000°F, then I would not have expected to see cycling around 550°F. Of course, nothing in those specifications says WHERE the temperature might be taken to get that 1200°F, so perhaps if the temperature probe were jammed down inside the nozzle close to the heating elements, you might see it that hot. But in my view, if a heat gun is being used on its highest settings closer than 2"" from the work object, that could be a safety issue, so I went with the 2"" that would be typical, at least for things like heat shrink tubing.BTW, most heat shrink tubing is polyolefin, and the normal recommended shrink temperature for that is about 200°F, so the LOW fan setting and the temperature knob turned to about center of its rotation will be plenty warm for that task.Please look for my separate review of the digitally controlled version of this heat gun.

  Already spent a few hours scraping thick layers of paint off the house...requires the highest heat, but works fine. Seems sturdy and came with LOTS of attachments and scrapers (more than mentioned in the listing). Big improvement over my old one (which lasted 20 years, but had a tendency to ignite wood splinters). Better heat control; also a little wire stand to rest on as it cools. I noticed that the sound of the fan/motor changes after using it for a while; probably a good idea to cool for a few minutes when that happens?

  I do a lot of electronic work, especially on PCB boards. I often have to remove through-hole components and sometimes desoldering them with my Hakko soldering iron and a solder pump just doesn't work and the part is very hard to remove. I decided to forego paying a lot for a cheap specialized hot air reflow station and instead try a high temperature heat gun. It made a huge difference. This heat gun is able to get hot enough to melt the solder, leaving me to remove the component with tweezers while the solder is still liquid. What a time saver! I wish I had bought one sooner.My only gripe with this unit is that it's hard to tell precisely how hot the air is, there is no temperature reading or even a general idea given on the turn dial. Solder melts around 370 Fahrenheit, and I had the gun turned up about 3/4 of the way. I could have been a bit under or over temperature though, TBH.

  Works extremely well, I'm very, very happy with it. The temperature adjustment dial I could swear is labelled backwards however- unless I'm totally misinterpreting it, hot and cold on the dial are switched. I actually thought it was broken at first because the temperature was so low, until I turned the knob the other way and it got as hot as expected.Still, fantastic purchase.

  Heat gun works great. I will say the temp control is easy to use but can easily be misunderstood at a glance. There's a triangle on the gun just above the temperature control. This might make you think the triangle is an arrow pointing at the control knob to tell you what temp you've selected. That would be false. When turned all the way up, the triangle is pointing at the lowest temp. When turned all the way down, the triangle is pointing at the highest temp. Took me a second to realize that.

  I don't get why the package dimensions are so important when nowhere does it lists what size drain openings this will fit. It does not fit all drains, especially those with a disposal. I've tried this in 4 drains and it's a loose fit in all of them. This does not lock into the drain opening. It basically sits on top and relies on the weight of the water to create a seal. If you try to open the strainer the whole stopper pops up.Good idea, but lacks in design for all sinks. There are better options that actually work and it's not this one.

  Update 4/282020:  Item returned for refund and received by amazon on 4/24/2020;  still no refund provided.I bought an OXO Good Grips 2-in-1 Sink Strainer Stopper to replace the cheap steal strainer in my sink.  Seems those cheap ones all break in a matter of months.  I put it into use as soon as it arrived (about 20 minutes ago). So, I figured a strainer/stopper that cost 500% more would be, at least, 100% better.  I hate when I'm wrong!Made of silicone, this product has a steal ring running near the edge with about 1/16"" of silicone extending beyond the steel ring.  However, it does not completely cover a standard 3 1/2"" kitchen sink drain, so it does not seal around the joint which let's water drain under the edges when the stopper is put into service.  Instead of sealing the ID of the drain as do the cheap ones, there is no way it can prevent water from draining out of the sink.Additionally, the edge of the strainer sticks up above the level of the sink about 1/16"".  This prevents almost all garbage from draining into the strainer which means all the garbage must be hand-pushed into the strainer or picked out of the sink by hand.This is a lose-lose situation for the purchaser

  I've had the strainer-only version of this for years and, while not perfect, it has done its job well, so I immediately jumped on the 2-in-1 strainer/stopper version when my classic style stainless steel stopper broke.Unfortunately, this model has quite a few flaws:1. As a strainer, it does a poor job of filtering out smaller particles while also getting easily clogged up with an amount of stuff that any other strainer could handle without a problem. The sink I put it in actually clogged recently, despite never clogging with the old strainer, making me wonder if the strainer just isn't working well.2. The rubber parts get really slimy, so it needs frequently cleaning (this was one of my complaints about the strainer-only model).3. It's overly difficult to clean as the bottom piece that allows it to work as a stopper has just a small hole to access the inner portion. This wouldn't as much of an issue if it wasn't for the above issues with small bits getting through and the rubber getting slimy. You can pull the strainer side out to get some space to shove a sponge in to work around the inside, but it's awkward and tedious to get it completely clean and spending an inordinate amount of time cleaning a strainer/stopper just isn't something I want to do.4. The stopper is really easy to accidentally engage as it just takes a slight bump to the handle to rotate it.5. The lip is raised excessively, causing a small amount of water to puddle around the edges unless you remember to lift it up each time to let the water pass.

  My sink drain has been stained since I bought my house. I've scrubbed with a ridiculous amount of various cleaners, but still been unable to make it look better. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my well water. Also, I only had one strainer stopper that also looked nasty and would rarely decide to stop water from draining out. This little gem has made my day! It hides my nasty drains and it stops water from draining out. I'm so excited! It's the small things...literally.The first pic is a before picture showing just how nasty my drain looks. The 2nd picture is my drain with the new gadget in it. I bought 2 so I could have them on both sides of my sink. Hopefully they last and don't tarnish from my well water. I haven't had them long enough to know if they're easy to clean, but I think they're dishwasher safe, so that's a big plus.Don't overthink it.....get this! You won't be disappointed!

   The suction power is great and was able to stop the water. It filters well too. There are two problems, however.First is it’s hard to clean. You have to dissemble it as shown in the video. And because I cook a lot of meat, sometimes it gets oily and this thing gets GROSS if you don’t clean it often. The oil builds up. Last night when I open it, there were so much gunk in there that I even wanted to throw it away. You see in the video that it still looks bad. I actually cleaned it with my hands last night...Second, the water flow when you open it fully is not really fast... but I guess that’s something most of those water stopper share. I just wish it was quicker though, so that I would want to use it more often...Overall, as water stopper, it functions beautifully and the turning on-and-off type of set up is quiet brilliant.

  Normally I wait for at least several months experience with an item before reviewing it, but the outstanding customer service from Century deserves an immediate acknowledgement.I now how have 4 of these timers, 3 are functional. The original order was for 2 which is how they are packaged. Straight out of the box one failed to advance the time. The pass-through switch worked but the timer did not. Rather than return them I first sent the seller an email describing the issue. Less than 5 minutes later they responded with an apology and a promise that a replacement item would be sent the next day with a tracking number - which it was. It arrived from CA to the east coast 3 days later. (My email was sent at 9 PM by the way.)The replacements work fine.Two followup emails came from Century. One the day of shipment noting that both new timers had been tested and the second  3 days after receipt asking if things were satisfactory. This level of seller responsiveness is unusual and should be acknowledged.Specs: 3 prong,  non- polarized & grounded. Size: 3 1/4 in long, 2 1/4 in wide, 1 1/4 in deep.

A pass-through switch is located on the side to manually turn on the device plugged into the timer. Settings are: black dial is night, white dial is daytime. (The product title does not mention , that it's a ""mini-timer"" but the fine print in features does as does the product carton.)The plug is at the bottom of the timer and does not obstruct the lower outlet if inserted into the top one. Timer is operated by pressing down buttons around dial for the desired ON period. If buttons are up the circuit through the timer is turned off. [Note - timer is shipped with all buttons down.] A lip edge on each button must be pulled up and some force is required. It's best to rotate the dial as the buttons are pulled up so that the buttons to be pulled are at the sides of the timer to gain maximum leverage but it can be done with a fingernail.It's the smallest timer I have ever had which is good from a space viewpoint but the numbers on the dial are therefore extremely small and for people with less than excellent vision are difficult to read. My experience so far with the working timers has been good. An update will make note of problems, if any.

  Here are the ""good"" and ""bad"" on this product...1. The price is fantastic. A timer for $6..2. The construction is heavy plastic. It is very rugged..3. The size is smaller than the company's standard timer..4. There are 48 possible half hour settings to select...DISADVANTAGES.1. The length of each setting is a half hour. The company's standard product is bigger, and each setting is 15 minutes.

  Excellent quality. Definitely recommend.One small tip: When I first received them I thought there was a defect because I couldn't push the pins down. However, the problem was simply that they arrived with all the pins pushed down and you just have to flip them to the up position where you want.

  Broke after ~2 weeks of use. Taking it apart revealed that there is a tiny plastic pin that broke (see images). That pin is responsible for holding the assembly which presses down on the switch to activate the power plug when the dial moves to the right time/position. That pin undergoes a lot of stress when the switch on the side is pushed into the ""Always On"" position, so I'm guessing it was because I overused the on/off switch on the side to turn the lights on. If the second one lasts longer I'll update this review.

  The quality of these is terrible.  I tried both and they make an annoying noise that I could hear across the room of the dial turning.  Some of the pieces you press to set the time would not move, even when pressing very hard. The switch on the side is extremely flimsy.  The units got warm after a few min of use with one low power LED light plugged in.  Most of the good reviews of this must be fake. This is one of the cheapest feeling products I’ve ever had.

  Only had them for about a week, but good to go so far.  They are quite a bit smaller than other three-prong mechanical timers, and the way you set on and off times with the pull up/push down tabs all the way around the dial is also different, but they work fine.  I bought them to use on my aquarium for CO2 injection using a solenoid, and light management, but tested them on a desk lamp for a couple of days first, just to make sure they worked and kept accurate time.  They do seem to keep time over a couple of days, although as with any type of 24 hour timer, you will have to check it periodically to ensure that it has not lost or gained time.  These are an inexpensive solution that works, if you need a three-prong timer! Only reason for the minus one star is the short period I have had them in use...usually don't give 5 until the product has proven itself over time.

  My whole family sits by one of the couches at some time and wants to plug in their wires for charging. The problem is that even with a standard 3 port expander it still isn’t enough. Now with this design it has the three pronged outlet for most electronic needs, like you laptop or a/c. It then has USB ports for all the wires like for phones or small fans.The strip isn’t so flimsy like a lot of other strips and feels well made. The actual plastic housing also doesn’t feel cheap and there is a small blue led that shoes if there is power flowingIt is a three pronged wire so it can’t plug into any outlet in the house so make sure you have such an outlet before you buy this power strip. All in all this power strip really helped with the charging needs of my family

  Perfect power strip with USB connections for my office space.  Cord that plugs into the wall is wrapped to prevent pinching/tangling and is long enough to reach the back of my desktop to easily access the 4 USB charging ports that are on the power strip.  The 3 plugs make charging the laptop and other devices quick and convenient as it is on my desktop and I no longer have to fumble at the wall, under the desk, to plug the cord into the outlet then run the wire up the back of the desk to my laptop to then plug it in when I travel with the power cord. Very convenient for an older professional to no longer have to get on the floor to plug things in! USB charging ports are quick and speedy in charging all the devices I have plugged into them.  All around a very durable product! You won't be disappointed.

  I always take a power strip for our cruises since there is typically only 1 outlet in the cabin.  Power strips have these horribly rigid cords that can make placing your strip where you want it a bit challenging.  The cord on this item allows much more flexibility.  The plug outlets are spaced apart enough to allow for bulkier charging devices to be plugged in next to each other.

  This is a really cute and handy power strip. I like that it’s petite and has the usb plugs. It’s very light, which isn’t bad but there’s not much of a grip at the bottom, so it will easily slip off of wherever you have it. I’d recommend securing it with double sided tape. A small feature I was bummed out about was the length of the cord. It’s great for a really short distance but for me personally, a little longer cord would’ve been great. Another great plus (if you’re Like me and can hear these things) it does not make any noise, like that annoying electric current noise. Which is awesome.

  So much yes! I was just on a cruise and the main thing I needed this for was my fan. I CANNOT sleep without a fan. I was told that there are very little outlets in our room and I should purchase this. It’s perfect!

  I love everything about this surge protector... it has a high-quality flexible cord long enough for me (I use it for charging my iPhone, iPad, LED lamp, LED clock on my dresser drawer).It comes w/ 3 outlets, 3 USB, and 1 USB C.  It does have a little green led light showing the USB charging is on.The design is spot on. It also comes with an attached velcro for cable management.The best thing the added beside the USB C is the off angle 3 prong plug so it doesn't get in the other outlet's way...nice.Buy this one unless you want more USB C outlets...

  I originally purchased separately the plastic 23 inch cleaner to unclog the shower drain. However that was not long enough and although something came out it only caused the drain to clog up completely. Desperate to fix the problem (since the water did not go down), I ordered this hoping the 40 inch would do the trick. It arrived the very same day (prime shipping). At first I struggled with it but after a couple of tries, figured out how to use it. You need to twist (turn) the coil by the handle once it’s inside the pipe. What it removed was horrifying and satisfying both at the same time. Finally the water runs down the drain like a dream! I bought the oxo drain protector as well to further protect the drain. I am so relieved! And totally recommend this product.

   We bought this for our bathtub, which was clogged and half of water  since several days ago, it flow very very slow. The drain gets stucked of long hairs I guess.  My wife always likes combing her long, thick hair in the bathroom. It is perhap one of the reasons why the drain does not work well.It was horrible, it became smelly,  I should never let it happen again to us.These are really great tools. I am so excited about this product. Today, finally, after using the tools I just received, the drain is unclogged now.I only followed the tips from people who had tried them already and used only one tool from this kit. You know what, the little tool is amazing. It is quite easy to use all around. You just need to do like what I did in the video uploaded. After several times, the drain works for us again. It totally solved our problem. It helped me get out a lot of hair mixed stuff from the drain.Strongly recommended to buy this drain kit and the price is good too.

  I have had clogs before. Oh boy, have I! I have even had to deal with clogs at work because sometimes people flush things they know darn tootin' well they have no earthly business flushing. You know who you are! Anyway, my toilet decided to go on strike right smack dab in the middle of a major pandemic. Plumbers were like --'Nope, we ain't touchin' that thing. . .but if we do we're gonna charge ya, Scroogie! We're gonna bankrupt you and make a mess while we're there!' Okay, they didn't say that but that's what I imagined they would say to me if they had been open. They were shutdown -- just like everything else around here -- except my job and the hospital. So I decided to take matters into my own hands -- quite literally, chaps.So I dialed up the old internet and found this thing on Amazon and decided to give it the ole college try. Since I do have some experience with clogs I had an idea of the issue at hand. And as embarrassing as this is to admit -- entirely my fault. Because of the pandemic people decided they needed to poop more and because of that they bought up all the toilet paper. I decided some paper towels would work to handle issues I would rather not discuss. Boy, what a mistake. And it could have been a very costly mistake.But thanks to this device that was not the case! You folks should have seen me, I went after that clog with a vengeance. It was no match really. I pwned it so badly I should have been video recording it and yelling ""World Star!"". So I won this battle and now my toilet flushes with such ease that it's literally like music to my ears. . .and my wallet.I don't know how well the results will be for other people since clogs come in all shapes and sizes and some are deeper than others but this product worked very well for me. Also included were some plastic little things for sink clogs that I bet will work great on hair in the drain. Unfortunately for me, I am going bald so I will unlikely ever get the joy of testing those out. But I have them just in case! So that's my review.

  This neat little pack comes with a bunch of different tools that can get into different types of drains. When one didn’t really work in my sink drain I just tried another until I found the right one. The green and orange plastic ones are pretty sturdy. I struggled with getting it out of my tub drain, it got caught a lot, but the spikes down the side never broke and they grabbed on to a lot of hair and clumps on its way out. Also, one thing I didn’t think I saw in the description was a small flower with a chain and plastic nubs. I have left it in my bathtub drain and since it’s caught a lot of loose hair and it super easy to clean. In other reviews I saw that others received this flower so I don’t think it was a miss ship. My only little con is that it came in a plain plastic bag with no instructions on which snake might be best for which situation. I mean it’s not too hard to figure out after a little playing around with them, but would have been nice to have a little more of an idea of what all I got.

We've tried different plungers different drain clearing liquids and different tools and none have worked as good as this.

  We have a cat who has been struggling with acid reflux and the bedroom carpet is his go-to place for early-am vomiting. (He has been treated and is doing a lot better now.) I normally treat the stains by hand with paper towels and spray cleaner, but I began to fear that despite my best efforts the carpet was probably more horck at this point than it was berber.I ordered the Hoover Paws & Claws carpet cleaner based on pawsitive reviews and the fact that our upright carpet cleaner is a Hoover. I was really pleased with the results! Using the upright cleaner with care, going over tougher stains multiple times and being sure to rinse and dry thoroughly, this cleaning solution did better than any other Hoover liquid shampoo I've used in the past.It also has a very light, fresh scent that was a huge relief to me. I get migraines and am sensitive to smells, so I was really happy that this one smells nice and didn't bother me at all.I would definitely recommend this.

The package was wet (and it hadn't been raining) so it may have gotten damaged and leaked all over the package.

   *TIPS*-For those of you that are having trouble with colors after calibrating, and are willing/still have the ability to physically move the camera, try this:After calibration slightly move the camera around the calibrated vicinity until the colors mimic what's on the TV screen. That is the spot, and angle, you need to have your camera. In my application, mine is placed below my TV on the center channel. My colors weren't correct and it was due to my camera having moved when I bumped the stand.  Once I realized this, I moved the camera and used the changing of the colors on the LEDs matching up to the colors on the screen to figure out where to replace the camera. Took 15 seconds.-Don't be afraid to move the camera and recalibrate again/more then once if you are not attaining the proper results.-Not quite getting the colors you want? Try adjusting the saturation bar in the app all the way down if need be. This kept my whites from becoming too blue and my yellows from becoming too green.-For those not wanting to stick the orange calibration cubes on their screen, try performing a web search for Govee Calibration Test Screen. That video may or may not serve as an alternative. I misplaced my cubes and ended up using it with no issues and similar results.-Check out their product website for constant sales. Wish I would have checked there first.*12/30/20 UPDATE ADDED AT BOTTOM**ORIGINAL REVIEW*This is not my first set of Govee brand light strips as I also currently own  2 sets of their H6163 model in use under my couch and media center. Having had such a great experience with those, I decided to try out one of their TV light strips. I had been actively searching for a lighting setup that reacted to what was on the screen for quite a few years. Those in a similar boat have heard names such as Ambilight, Dream Screen, amongst others. The problem was that they always seemed to have too many bugs, limitations, or required more work outside a simple plug and play effort. Seeing how far tech has come along, I'm glad I waited as these seem to be superior in quite a few ways.Installation:This was installed on a wall mounted 85"" Sony. Govee lists this strip as fitting up to an 75"" screen. This is a bit of a play on words as yes it is true it can fit, but it is obviously designed to fit something closer to a 55 or 65"" screen. The idea is to have the strip stuck to the back of the TV as close to the edge of the border as possible. I am nowhere near the border on the 85"" but I knew the limitations surrounding the screen size before ordering and thus my expectations were already in check. I laid the lights out to test they all worked as well as measured the length. Govee lists them as being roughly 12.5 feet. I measured about 14 feet including the wires that curve around the corners of the TV. I wanted the power line to fall on the right side when facing the back of the TV so I ran the strip clockwise starting from the bottom right. I ended up installing them roughly 7-8 inches from the edge of the sides and about 4 to 5"" away on the top and bottom as I felt this was the best use of the length provided in relation to the screen size I have. Your experience may vary depending on your layout.I plugged everything into the control box and rather than stick it to the TV using the installed double sided tape, I was able to simply wedge it in between my mount and TV. I'm glad I did that as initially I had installed the camera on the top of the TV but wasn't a fan of the ""UFO antenna"" look. Plus once I calibrated it using the app it seemed the screen didn't fit within the camera. During calibration the app asks if you chose to install the camera on top of the TV or the bottom. I ended up moving the control box lower on the back of the TV and taping the camera to my center channel which is just a few inches below the TV. Recalibrating in this new location provided me enough distance from the TV for the camera to catch the entire screen while also having the added bonus of placing the camera in a more discreet location. Having calibrated the camera to the screen a few times differently to see if the way I calibrated made a difference, I realized camera location and calibration is key to making this work correctly.Experience:This light strip does all the cool party tricks the H6163 model does but now with an additional ""video"" mode! This is the reason you buy this kit. It is in this mode that the lights react to what is on the screen via what is captured in the camera. I personally have not had the issues some have mentioned they had with previous model(s). The colors of the lights have done a great job reacting to what is on the screen and can get quite bright. There is some latency in changing colors especially in the movie configuration of video mode although transitions are smoother. Latency seems reduced in the game configuration of video mode with a more rapid color transition. You can also decide if you want the lighting to be distributed sectionally based on what is captured on the screen, or if you prefer to have the whole border react to showing just one color at a time...similar to the old Philips TVs from some years back. I went back and forth while watching some HDR and Dolby Vision movies and both modes work great depending on how you feel that day. I can see where the game mode would be preferred by gamers due to the lower latency of the lighting transitions. There is also a ""saturation"" scroll bar which allows you to fine tune how deep the colors show. I adjusted the distance of the TV from the wall to see how the lights responded to being farther from the wall. I currently settled at being about 9"" from the wall but I am still playing with the distance. My fear was the lights would be set so far away from the edge of the TV that brightness would suffer but that isn't the case. I have nothing negative to say about how bright these get as they get bright enough for my application.The Immersion lights have an updated version of an existing ability on my H6163 light strips which is the ability to access all app features without having to turn on bluetooth since it works over your wifi network. I wish the H6163 model worked this way as it is somewhat of a bummer when you are flowing with everything and then have to stop to turn the bluetooth on to access DIY mode. The Immersion lights ""Scenes"" mode also has 4 additional themes with the ability to adjust the brightness. The H6163 model does not allow you to change the brightness of the Scenes mode. Hopefully a future update will allow this ability on my H6163 to match the Immersion lights.Integration:My H6163 already syncs with my Google Home so adding the Immersion lights was as easy as opening the app, finding the Immersion light model, and adding it. I have set up some custom scene profiles to be able to control all of the lights grouped in various ways.  You'll need to go into your google home app and add the lights to a room to take full advantage of controlling the lights via ""OK/Hey Google..."". The Govee app also allows the ability to set the lights to turn on/off by setting a timer but I prefer walking into the room and commanding google to handle that responsibility. It is quite impressive to walk into the room with company and telling google to ""turn on the media room lights"" as they watch the lights turn on in their last configured setup they were last turned off in. Your hard work is rewarded with high praise followed by questions on how to attain a similar setup in their home. This is furthered when they watch a movie or play a game as their viewing experience is heightened from the lights behind the TV reacting to what is on the screen.Customer Service:I reached out to Govee before purchasing to see if offering a true 85"" version of the immersion style lights was on their road map. I had a response in my email the next day stating they currently have no plans to do such. I haven't had to have any warranty work performed but the fact that I am getting any response at all, let alone the next day, is promising especially when customer service and follow-up seems to be lacking in so many of today's companies.Final Thoughts:Govee seems to constantly keep their app updated with new ways on how it reacts with their light strips. They also seem in tune with their fan base/critics and what is being requested in future applications and updates. My biggest gripe is that I feel Govee needs to expand their lineup for this strip to truly match the size of the TV especially as larger TVs become more popular amongst buyers. This has been echoed many times in many reviews of their other products. Given the price point of this in comparison to the Philips Hue, which I was also considering, this is an amazing product! I would happily pay more to have a true 85"" kit if they ever came out with it and would gladly be a tester if they offered it. In the meantime, I am very satisfied with the current offering.*12/30/20 UPDATE*It looks like they have changed the size parameters in their description to fitting 55-65"". Though this set of lights is a truer fit for those size TVs, I've had these on my 85"" for a few weeks and I'm not disappointed. Here's why:-Adhesive and build quality-I've removed the lights from the TV a few times to reposition them better for my application. I did no additional wiping down of the surface and was even a little aggressive with the removal. I would have figured by now that the adhesive would have started to fail me but this is not the case. The lights still adhere exactly where I placed them and all lights still work with no issues. I definitely recommend measuring the area where you plan to install these in hopes of a more ""one and done"" setup, but it's good to know you can reapply if it's not to your liking the first time around.-Brightness-Even though the light strip does not reach the edges of the TV as it would in the sizes it is recommended for, sliding the brightness bar up to 100% yielded lights bright enough that I don't necessarily feel like I'm missing out on the experience. I typically have the brightness closer to 50% which creates a more cohesive feel in my setup. I've still got the TV pulled about 8 to 9 inches from the wall and I get plenty of color expanding quite far out from the outer edges of the TV.  I'm still playing with the wall-to-TV distance but playing with both has helped heighten the experience.I would still like to see an 85"" specific version of these lights produced as I would purchase them, moving my current set to the 65"" TV I have in another room. I'm still advocating having a true to size fit would allow for a tighter halo look around the borders rather than a ""glow"" from behind the screen. It would also increase the amount of color in the corners where currently, due to the length and placement of the light strips in my application, it is somewhat absent. Fortunately the lighting blooms enough from the surrounding strips that it's not totally void of light.As I continue to play with these lights I'll try to leave tips which have helped me attain a better overall experience.

  I have a 65"" Sony 850E, not the best, but middle of the pack for LED TVs.I was considering updating it as it is 3 years old and the newer TV ar a bit sharper and have new technology that upscales the picture a bit better. However after reading some reviews and watching a few YouTubes on improving your home viewing experience, the one thing that was touched on over and over was the reduction of eye strain when viewing a bright TV in a dark room. Digging further into the subject, most 'Experts' recommended using TV Backlights. Looking a bit more I found that there were a lot of choices out there, ranging from around $10 - $300+. After cutting through the price vs. performance of various products, it seemed to me that the static lights that either were just a single color or you had to use a remote or app to change the colors did not relieve the eye strain as well as active lights. Active lights are different because they use input from either the HDMI port or an external source, such as a camera to 'synch' the lights response to the active picture being shown on the screen. Philips Hue is a very good system that uses a HDMI hub to capture the incoming digital information to ensure that the light reacted quickly and smoothly to whatever was on screen. This option while fast and almost decorative, can be expensive as all parts, the lights and the hub are sold separately, the upside is that all Hue products can be synchronized to work together, meaning that your Hue light bulbs can be synched with you TV lighting system to have a more immersive viewing and gaming experience. Where they fall a bit flat, other than the cost, for me is the fact that your Streaming Apps that work directly on your smart TV will not trigger the lights synching with your screen, as it is not sending anything through the HDMI ports. Yes you can get a ROKU or Fire Stick, but then, what's the point of having a smart TV? Govee push the limit and the price point a but differently. They decided to have a small HD camera 'watch' the screen and respond based on what it 'saw'. Of course the other difference between Hue and Govee is install times and methods. Hue is basically a Plug & Play solution, where you just plug your cable, game console, blu ray player into Hue's HDMI hub and the hub into the TV, download the app onto your phone/tablet, setup the standalone lights and your done. Govee is a bit more involved, I would first remove everything from the box and plug the lights, camera and power into the small hub, make sure the lights all are on. Next, look at the little arrow on the LED strip and which way it runs, as it comes as a single segmented strip, use some painters tape to arrange the strip around the rear of your TV. This will make adjustments easier so that when you strip off the plastic covering the adhesive backing, you will be more confident about it's placement. You want to try to make sure the top and bottom part of the LED strip is as even as possible. There are four corner breaks on the strip, where it can be gently twisted and bent to provide better placement. Next you are supposed to place the camera on either the top middle or bottom middle of the TV, the bracket on the camera has a real good 3M adhesive already in place. I however did not want to stick anything to the top of my TV permanently and I have and XBox Kinect already up top on this type of bracket https://tinyurl.com/y687xus9So instead I used a small Command strip hook and loop on the top of my Kinect and on the camera and stuck it on top of my Kinect. I believe raising the camera height in this manner helps the camera to 'see' more of the screen and avoids issues of color responses that I have seen others complain about. After connecting the camera, LED strip and power to the hub, I used the 7 orange spongey squares to my screen, three on each side, especially the corners an the last one at the bottom middle of the screen. I downloaded the App on my Iphone and inputted access for my WiFi. Small concern here, most phones, tablets have 5ghz capability and benefit from the speed and less crowded bandwidth. However, Govee will only recognize 2.4ghz, so in order to use the WiFi connection, you will have to go into your phone setting and change the WiFi access to 2.4ghz, it will not connect otherwise. After you get your Govee app to see the backlights, you can now turn them on or off, change how and what colors the lights display, brightness and saturation of the lights as well as set 'scenes' for mood lighting. It also features a Game mode, which seems to force a faster response for the camera, where as the Movie mode, lets the colors transition more smoothly and seems to flow with the picture displayed. Next, with the TV off, you go into the settings icon, on the top right portion of the app and then choose, 'Calibration'. Just follow the instructions and try to make sure that you get all 7 orange squares within the 5 points that they give you. Also note, if you tend to watch black and white or monochrome older films and shows, the camera gets confused and will display the lights more towards the purple\blue end of the light spectrum, more purple as the screen shows blacks. There were complaints from early version that the device did not correctly interpret greens or orange colors, that seems to either have been fixed or the simple fact that I have my camera mounted about 7"" above the screen and the newer H6199 version has a 1080p camera.Final thoughts, after having these lights installed and active for over 2 weeks I think that I can honestly say, they do seem to decrease eye strain as I have had less headaches after late night movie watching. The screen seems bigger as the lights give the illusion that the action on the screen is flowing beyond it. It does add another dimension to gaming as in gaming mode the lighting changes as the gameplay changes creating a more immersive playing venue. While I will not take away anything from Philip Hue's bright and fast reactive system, $70 dollars is quite a bit of difference from Hue's costing $149 for the two light gameplay with hub base kit, and another $419 Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box. If you have the spare change laying around and you don't care about reactive lighting for your TVs built in smart apps, the Philips Hue is the better system.

  Easy to use, self explanatory really. The attached picture is actually of the cage around a tree in my yard so we don’t walk into it in the dark.  It’s on a side of the house where there are no lights so the picture is very representative of the brightness.  That side of the house gets full sun for 12 -14 hours (Texas) and the lights are still glowing when the sun comes up. Heat doesn’t bother them.  I have one set in a different area that have been in place for 3 years. The only thing that I have to do is occasionally change the rechargeable battery.

  After reading reviews from other brands that looked almost identical to the Sanjicha fairy lights (solar string lights), i decided to spend the extra couple of dollars for these.  And I’m glad I did!  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  The instructions were clear and precise.  Within ten minutes I was outside stringing the up in a tree in my backyard.  The on/off button is easy to find, and use.  The button next to it controls the 8 different twinkle modes.  They were charged already right out of the box.  I ordered the gold wire with warm white lights.  After it got dark and they started twinkling, my next door neighbor noticed them immediately, and texted how beautiful they were.  The very long wires are carefully wrapped around a piece of cardboard, so no tangled messes to deal with. Overall well made and sturdy.  Very pleased with this purchase!

  I do like the multiple function the copper wire isn’t as obvious during the day but definitely not as bright as shown I hung both strings Of lights giving me a total of 5  wires together for the space I had  as the picture shows you need a lot more lights to get your space brighter Can’t comment on long term only had them two days  but they showed up on timeHad to come back and update my review after a few days I noticed I was having to reset the mode every evening on one set of light I sent an email asking how to fix the problem Apparently there is no fix they are sending a new set of lights to replace they defective lights

  Update: amazing customer service! I didn't even reach out to this company but they reached out to me to ensure that I was satisfied with my lights. I mentioned one of them wasn't working right after a few days and they replaced it for me! I have had horror stories with other Amazon companies but this one is amazing. Lights are beautiful and stay on way longer than even the new solar lights in the ground I installed! They go on automatically and then seem to turn off in the early morning, so they last allll night! I highly recommend. I'll be purchasing more around the holidays!

  I bought two of these string lights for my backyard lighting project. The lights are very bright and they last for a long time! I absolutely love them. The wire is so easy to wrap around anything, on my tree and pergola, and it runs along the yard perimeter. It has different modes, and it is cool to change the mode frequently, and it changes the look in my backyard. They look so gorgeous at night time, the strings are almost invisible during daytime.The  only wish I have is for the solar panel to be mountable. Other solar lights I bought has a mountable option, in addition to pushing the pole to the soil/ground. This Sanjicha brand doesn't have the mount to install up on the fence, so I have to leave the solar panel on the ground. It'd be good to have both options.Anyhow, I am very happy with the lights because they are bright, long lasting, and super easy to wrap around anything!

  These lights were delivered on time and in new condition. They were easy to put together and set up. My ONLY issue is how the manufacturer wrapped the coil. It was IMPOSSIBLE to unravel this without undoing the entire light string. It was very frustrating. Aside from that, I set them up, and waited for sundown to see them do their thing. They are really pretty and I LOVE the different modes. I’m satisfied with this purchase.

  Loved the lights, just the right amount of brightness. Only issue was unwinding my 2nd light I spent 15 min trying to untangle the way it was wound. Threw it out wasn't worth the hassle.  The company contacted me about the difficulties with one string . They sent me a new one with me even requesting. Wonderful customer service

  An extension cord, power extender, drop cord, or extension lead is a length of flexible electrical power cable (flex) with a plug on one end and ONE OR MORE sockets on the other end. This extension cord affords ONE socket and does the job at a reasonable price. Extension cords come in various colors, lengths, thicknesses and service duties. This is a dark black heavy gauge cord.

  Be careful ordering.  I ordered 3 of these, which are supposed have standard male and female ends.  By standard, I mean the male end could be plugged into any normal 3 prong grounded outlet in the United States.  And the female end should be able to receive any normal 3 prong grounded plug.  In fact, based on the item description and photo, you'd expect that the male end of this item could actually be plugged into the female end of this item.  What I received had the male end exactly as pictured, but the female end has three vertical rectangular slots (see photo).I submitted a ""return/replace"" request with Amazon and described the issue.  Quite promptly, I received a new package of 3 more cords, but to my dismay, they're exactly the same.  So I'm now in my second ""return/replace"" effort.  If I manage to get the correct item, I'll update my review accordingly.

  So something must have happened to my microwave when it was being created in the microwave factory. Obviously the incredibly short (like 1 inch) cord that came with my microwave must have been some gigantic oversight and break down in the quality control process. There's no way everything went smoothly if the end result was the pathetic cord attached to the bringer of my hot pockets. That said, this extension card has made my microwave whole again. It is no longer picked on by the other microwaves for it's short cord. My microwave no longer feels inadequate in its quest to reach a socket for electrical power. The quality and durable 3 foot extension cord that arrived in the mail has my microwave humming along nicely. The cord matches everything nicely and looks exactly like it's part of the original product. Nobody can tell it's an extension. If you too have an appliance that needs a little extra length, this is your extension cord (<-- not a euphemism).

  Needed a super short, 3 prong, outdoor rated extension cord to change the orientation of our pool pump plug-in because I upgraded to a smart outdoor plug-in that's mounted to a post on the underside of my deck railing and the transformer for the pool plug would be sticking out last the back of the plug-in.  I used this to mount the pool plug-in a little farther down the railing.  Works well, we've had a few storms so far and I haven't had any troubles with it.  The price isn't bad, but I would have liked to find something a little less.

  I had purchased one of the electric bug zappers to hand by the rear sliding doors. The only problem was that the power cord on it was only 2' long. I couldn't believe it. Who would make and sell a bug zapper with only a 2' electric cord? Any, I only need 3' more to reach the electric outlet and this 3' extension cord perfectly fit the bill. Not only was it a good fit, but it made it possible to turn the zapper on and off just by disconnecting the two cables. An excellent purchase overall.

  I purchased this 6 ft. 16 gauge 3 wire black extension cord. This cord seems well made and carries a UL certification. It's nice that they have a permanent tag attached indicating the 13A, 1625W capacity of the cord (right next to the UL holographic tag). This cord weighs 8.3 ounces, which is different than the 1.6 ounces they state on the Amazon page listing. Too bad, because a lighter weight would have been great for travel. For the price I don't think you could find a nicer cord than this.

  I originally purchased a more expensive LED light strip with remote control.  However it was returned because the lights did not reliably respond to the remote control and the electronics got extremely hot to the touch.I purchased these since everything was included and the price was very inexpensive.  Everything worked great!  The lights were very easy to install, they always respond to the remote control, and they don't get hot!  Excellent product and you cant beat the price.My only negative remark is that there are no instructions included on how to program your own scenes with the remote control.

   This lighting is quick and very easy to install. Just make sure that you clean the surface well, plan your project and apply the item only once. I do recommend installing the item in a location where it will be hidden when not in use. It can look a bit ""tacky"" if it is too noticeable when not in use. I have a very old stairwell that gets extremely dark at night. The last step, at the bottom, can be a mess as it seems to be a bit shorter and can cause a person to trip in the dark. ���� These lights make the stairwell safe at night. It also adds a little ""flavor"" to my century old house! I love it! ��

  I wasn't sure how well these would work, but was pleasantly surprised.  I bought to backlight a custom headboard.  The LEDs were adhered directly to unfinished pine boards.  The adhesive is really strong and didn't have any problems sticking to the wood.  My kids love the color change features.  There is plenty of adjustability to the brightness.  I have tried the custom settings and probably won't.  The preset colors work well for my needs.  I've had these for 4 months now with no issues.

  The instructions are SO DANG SMALL! They are microscopic almost, printed on a piece of paper as big as a match box. Didn't even think these were instructions! So, watch closely, they're in there. Have a slick clean surface and double sided tape to make these stick on the wall, or desk or whatever you want them for. My teenager likes the remote control to flip thru the different colors & flashing speed options. He wants another set of these, since 16ft only covered 2 walls of his room. :) Maybe get the bigger strand by Minger.

  I was surprised to see all the negative reviews on this item ranging from missing parts, size too small, and lack of adhesion.  SCOTCH is a household name for good reason so I bought them to replace the pads on my dining room chairs.  Very happy with size (they are 1"" and round) and with the proper placement they adhered nicely.  FYI - place them on the feet of the chair and then sit on it for a few minutes while surfing facebook - do not move the chair during this time.  I recommend having a drink handy as well.  After a few minutes you are golden and should have a nice buzz on - repeat for all chairs followed by a dose of Tylenol for your future headache.  Seriously, these have been in place for months now with no issue.

  Felt pads were one of those things that I thought was a commodity - one brand was pretty much the same as another. Putting them on chair legs means that you'll be replacing them every couple of months, so I've had a chance to try out many different brands over the years, including many from local big box stores.I've found, though, that there are some differences among brands. The Scotch felt pads seem to have a more effective adhesive than other felt pads, so that I don't have to replace them quite as often. For me this makes up for any issues with slightly higher cost than other brands. If you're getting felt pads for low-use settings, any brand should be fine. If you want a step up in quality, though, these are great.

  These pads are being used on the bottom of wooden breakfast room chairs on a wood floor. They are easy to apply, but they have to be reset into place about every two weeks, as the adhesive is too puny to keep them affixed to the leg bottoms. In addition to frequently moving them back to the bottom, there is also the issue with adhesive on the floor (a Goo Gone job - a great product, by the way). This is a very annoying issue of constant maintenance. Scotch is a good brand, but these little devils have been a recurrent disappointment. As people age, getting down on the floor to reattach the pads and clean the floor becomes a hardship. My wife and I are not large (heavy) individuals and we strive not to slide the chairs any more than necessary with our weight on them. That notwithstanding, these pads do not stay in place, esp. the larger ones for the back legs.

  These pads are a bit more expensive but boy do they stick!  You learn quick not to put your finger on the sticky pad because it's hard to get off.  I used them before on chairs I recently refurbished and I had to use a hammer and chisel to get them off after 5 years of wear, to put the new ones on!

  You should know what to expect when you buy this or anything that simply tapes to the bottom of the chair legs.The truth is they should sell something like this with an actual bottle of adhesive - something more substantial that will fill in porous gaps and uneven areas, but they don't.  I got these fully expecting to adhere them to the bottom of my chairs with something more substantial.  No tape in the world was going to work, and when you buy something like this, that is essentially what it is - a double sided tape on the bottom of the felt.The adhesive itself would probably be just fine if each leg was perfectly flat, all four legs level to each other, and properly cleaned before applying.  Imagine taping this to the bottom of a perfectly flat piece of metal - I doubt they would come off anytime soon.  However on chairs this condition may not really exists - my chairs were particularly terrible both in the porousness of the wood in this area and the unevenness.  If left to its own devices - these pads would have very little area that was actually pressed between the floor and leg at any given time, and would tend to rock and re-position themselves off the leg quickly - as other users have noted.All I did was apply hot glue before pressing them on.  This helped fill the substantial gaps I had on my chairs and keep the pads more leveled.  Time will tell if they fall off on occasion, but I suspect this was a good work around for people having issues with them not adhering.Either way you can simply look at what the product is doing, taping felt to wood - and depending on your chair you may need to temper your expectations.

  I purchased these to put on the bottom of the legs of our wooden dining table and dining chairs. They adhered perfectly fine. They help decrease damage from pulling the chairs in and out. We have stone tiling in our kitchen so before I stuck these on, it would make a loud, unpleasant sound when pulling a chair. Now it is pretty quiet and no more damage on our new chairs. I will have to update later on down the road once it has gone through some wear and tear to see how it has held up. So far so good.

  I read the reviews (I always read the one star reviews first) on this and I have to say I was not going to buy it until I couldn't find one I wanted. I ordered and hoped for the best. I got a great Carousel! The cups fit and do not push others out when full. It turns well. I haven't had a problem at all with mine. I'm not sure what the issue was with some of the other reviewer's.. maybe a defective product? But I do know I'm glad I purchased this and it has and continues to serve me and my family wellEdit: Well over a year later and it’s still good as new! We use it daily!

  I love this carousel.  It's attractive, sturdy, and turns easily.  It also fits under my cupboard with heaps of room to spare.  It holds 35 reusable K-Cups that I fill myself, little gems that I also love.

  Its pretty cool but for some reason the pods don't all fit at once. if you fill it up they crash together in the center and push each other out. You can balance them in there but you have to be sort of careful and at least one in each row will be poking out a quarter of an inch or so. That said, its cool to have next to the keurig and it spins nicely, seem well made excluding the design flaw.

  We purchased this for the office at work. There's only a small space and just having the boxes out was a mess. I found this and it was perfect. As you can see in the photo, it's about as tall as the coffee machine but not nearly as wide and bulky. It's definitely a space saver! It holds the perfect amount of K-cups. It's very sturdy and it came assembled. The carousel turns beautifully. We've had it about 6 months and haven't had any issues. I highly recommend this product.

  I was planning to buy the original Keurig drawer, but because of the Keurig I have it would not have room to open it and insert a K cup without having to bring it forward so this was the next best thing. I bought some brands I have tried and some that came with our Keurig and so much fits. I love that it spins. No problem spinning and nothing was damaged. Completely filled, it is easily able to be picked up and moved around kitchen if need be. It holds up to 35 K-Cups. Great buy people if you have no room for drawer like me. :)

  After pinteresting and seeing cute ways to style the ""coffee corner"" I ordered this carousel instead of the typical k-cup drawer. This also worked better for me since I got the Keurig K-Cafe machine (review to come), and the drawers were all too small to fit under my coffee maker. It has turned out quite well, and fits well in the area. This holder fits a good variety of cups and doesn't require refilling too often. It turns easily and feels sturdy. Recommend for the price!

  I love this K-cup carousel! It’s streamlined so it doesn’t take up a lot of space on my counter and it’s made very well. Spins easily with light touch and looks great! The k cups slid in easily with no resistance and fit with no problems.  Very happy with this purchase.

   Have only just started using them, but so far I really like them.  I have a small deck - stuck the solar stakes into a flowerpot and ran the lights out either side.  The 8 modes all work, but you have to be patient sometimes for the new mode to start.  I am using the twinkly mode and am happy with the light output.  The copper wires seem very delicate, so we'll see if they last.

  One of the strings of lights in this pack of two was incredibly dim and then one day it stopped working. Opening up the solar panel revealed that one of the diodes wasn't even soldered onto the board!!! On of the wires also easily came off of a solder point. There was also too much hot glue used to keep the board in place.I did like how the wire was thin and had a lot of different lighting modes and would turn on automatically at night. But only one of the string lights even worked. Not worth the price.EDIT: The seller was kind enough to offer a replacement for the string light that wasn't working but the replacement also became dim after about a month. Unfortunately, these are cheap lights that don't last for more than about a month or so outside in the sun.EDIT 2: The seller sent a replacement again. Hopefully the new one works. At the very least, I respect the seller's responses and willingness to try to fix the problem.

  Several settings, works great, charges during the day and comes on at dusk.  I hope they continue to last!  I bought 3 set (each box has two so 6 strings) and stuck the charger spike into my planter facing the sun.Update: On cloudy/rainy days the charge only lasts till about midnight.  On sunny days I'm not sure what time they go out but I see one or two of them still weakly on when I get up at 5:00AM.  This is perfect for me because I really just care about the evening.  I live in Southern California so I get lots of sun.

  I purchased these lights to use outdoors year round.  The lights were nicely packaged and I found them easy to unwind to put them into place (I didn't experience any tangled wire! )  I installed the lights at approximately 7pm, with sunset to follow at 9:07pm.  To my surprise, when I went outdoors at 4am (total darkness) these lights were burning so brightly after just having 2 hours of daylight to charge! The mode button is super simple to operate to control solid or blinking lights.  I'm eager to see how these last throughout the summer and fall months.  I highly recommend these lights!

  These are the best string lights. I love the fact there are different modes to them. I had a set last year, which I used to look like water coming out of a watering can. I liked them so much, I bought two more strings. The ones I used from last year are still working and I just put a string around a pole that holds a birdhouse...love, love them. They cover a lot of area.

  I bought these for Christmas and yes, they’re still up. The lights are so nice and subtle that they provide a decorative addition to two trees that can withstand past the holiday season. For the price I thought that they would not last long, but I was proven wrong. One recommendation is to have an extra set of hands while installing as the wire can get tangled easily. Other than that, good purchase!

  The first is these lights are BRIGHT!! Never did I expect solar lights to be this bright. They are a wonderful bright white if that is what you are looking for. The second thing you need to know is that I would suggest making sure you know exactly where you want to put them and unroll them as you are placing them. If you unroll them all the way, then decide you don't want them where you put them, they become a long, tangled mess to deal with. It's not impossible to untangle them, but it is a chore. I am also not certain of the function of the modes. It seems I would choose one, but it would not stay on that mode so if that is important to you, read more reviews and see how others dealt with that issue. I've only had them a day so I may just need to work with them more.

  Previous headline:  ""Got the 2-pack.  One has no microphone audio.  Both have connection problems.""Original review:I ordered the 2-pack of Wyze Cam v2 for about $50.  Powered up the first one and connected to it via the Wyze app on my iPhone.  (Connecting means establishing a WiFi link from the phone to the camera so I can see its video, hear its audio, change its settings, etc.)  Sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes when I change the resolution or other setting the camera disconnects.  A few times I was completely unable to connect/reconnect until I restarted the iPhone app and/or cycled power to the camera.  Basically I found the connection process to be buggy and unreliable.  In addition, after testing for a while I realized I had no sound incoming from the first camera.  Seems like a hardware failure with the microphone.  So essentially the first camera is physically broken on arrival and needs to be replaced.I powered up the second camera of the 2-pack and had similar problems with connectivity but at least the microphone is working and I can hear incoming sound.  The connectivity problems persist with both cameras even with the camera firmware and iOS app updated to the latest versions and a 32GB microSD class 10 card installed in each one.Sadly, it seems you get what you pay for.  I've opened a support ticket with Wyze to see what they can do about replacing the camera with the bad microphone.  Based on how that goes I'll either keep them or return them to Amazon.UPDATE: I contacted support.  I told them what was wrong with lots of details.  They basically ignored the details and asked for everything all over again.  Told them again.  Sent more info during some back-and-forth.  Finally they said they'd put me in touch with their team for a replacement.  And then... nothing.  Haven't heard from them since.  Haven't gotten a replacement.  They completely dropped the ball.  So basically their customer service is on par with their product:  Cheap, shoddy and broken.  I'm going to return the product to Amazon and leave up this 1-star review so people will know what they're getting into.

  My rating is a compromise between value for money (hands down a 5+) and its usability (a three). First and foremost, this is NOT a security camera. In fact, Wyze states this clearly in their terms of service: “The products and services are not intended for use as security or life safety devices or services (such as a burglar alarm or monitoring system). Please do not rely on the products and services for any such critical uses.” So that said, adjust your expectations to conform.But for the price, it’s a really nifty monitoring system for non-critical applications, and a lot of thought and design have gone into the product (again, considering the price). Given that you have the correct wi-fi system, the setup is easy and straightforward. The camera is as described with good color and reasonable resolution. On a smart phone, the image looks crystal clear. However, on closer zoom examination, the transmitted image is noticeably degraded with compression artifacts, and thus the ability to recognize faces, license numbers, and the like will be somewhat limited to subjects within 10 or 15 feet of the camera. The night vision works well (black and white), and the built-in infrared lights nicely illuminate a typical room (of course, getting darker with distance). Note that you can’t point the camera through a window at night and use the built-in infrared lights – they reflect horribly on the glass. But the app allows you to turn them off. The microphone and speaker provide intelligible audio within a reasonably sized room. It’s not high quality, but it’s usable.The free cloud file service is a good idea, but for any reasonable use, you will want to get the optional on-board micro-SD card. The cloud storage drawback becomes very apparent due to the 12-second limit on uploaded files coupled with what they call the five-minute cooling off period between uploads. Thus, when some event triggers an upload, such as a person breaking in to your house, the recording ends before the real event occurs (such as that person rifling through all your belongings). I suspect the ‘cooling off period’ is really just a euphemism for data throttling to keep on-line storage to a manageable size. But with the on-board micro-SD card, that problem is solved – it’ll keep recording as long as it sees something happening. (But pay attention to the specs for the card – I bought the Wyze card just to be safe since they guarantee it.)The camera is also capable of time lapse video via an easily configurable app interface. However, I find that it’s buggy and unreliable since the resulting videos are often not accessible via the app. I’ve seen other on-line complaints about this, and the most common fix is to reformat the SD card. Unfortunately, that fix isn’t permanent (in my experience), and the problem isn’t apparent until after you’ve spent hours or days hoping to capture some one-of-a-kind event.The camera is designed to be used indoors. Some users, me included, use it outdoors. I purchased a tight-fitting enclosure to mount up under an eave, which ought to protect them from direct rain and snow, but I don’t have the expectation that they will last for years in that configuration.I had one encounter with their support team. I submitted a request to their on-line customer service system, and a knowledgeable and friendly tech responded within a day. The whole issue was settled with a couple of guided troubleshooting exchanges, and I received a new camera in less than a week from the first contact.In summary, it’s a very cost-effective and useful system for non-critical applications. The system and app seem to be a work in progress, and occasional problems elicit the wrath of users, but the company is generally responsive to problems. So for watching the dogs at home, documenting a storm, etc., it’s a good product. The Wyze development team has done a good job given the cost limitations, and I have subsequently bought three more.

  Ok my family has an Arlo, Nest, and now Wyze. Nest was my first camera at $180 for 1 camera. I hated that it didn’t record for long unless you paid for the service and also that it wasn’t wireless. The Arlo I installed in my moms home it records for a week is wireless and rechargeable, but comes with a hefty price tag of $600 for 3 camera set up. I wanted 2 more cameras and saw that the Wyze had good reviews. I thought for $25 a camera how could I lose and I’m so glad I did I bought it. These are for my first impressions. I haven’t played with it long enough to really give you more detail. There is a user-friendly ap and I have an IPhone XS the use of the ap and the quality of the pictures is pretty damn good for $25. Check out my pictures. I do have the Wyze camera and Nest camera behind glass windows. For the reviewers who complained that it doesn’t turn off and it records them naked....look I have dogs and I primarily use this to check on my new puppy. I wouldn’t install a camera where I would be walking around naked. Whether I could turn off the system or not.  Sure it can deter burglars but I have a 90lb German Shepherd whose bark can make your skin crawl. I don’t necessarily need to record but this camera has that option with the additional purchase of an SD card. I have to dock it a bit because it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the Arlo. It isn’t wireless and it doesn’t record the way the Arlo does but I don’t really need that option. Look where this camera lacks it makes up in price. I just ordered 2 more. Also too bad it’s not for outdoor use but my cameras I mount inside in front of windows. It can reach super high temperatures where I live and I don’t want to risk my Nest came melting on me. I installed a set of baxia solar powered lights and for under $200 I have a home security system with 4 cameras, recording capability and excellent image quality.

  One job. That's all you had. And for three months you did it like a pro. And then you went on strike. Were my sponges too dirty for you? Were you averse to my relationship with Brussels sprouts?I'm not sure. All I know is after three months or so the suction cups holding the tool stopped sucking. I now have the device sitting on a ledge over my sink.Allow me to sum this up. This product started sucking when it stopped sucking.

  This is one of those cheap purchases you make that pay off big.  I honestly can't imagine my life without this product. I go to other people's houses and judge them when I see their sponges, just LYING THERE on the counter or the bottom of the sink.  What are you, an animal? Get some self respect! Don't you realize what is happening to that sponge? If you're lucky you can nuke it in the microwave long enough to bring it back to life, but otherwise, that thing is a soaking bacteria garbage barge. Put it in its place! ...and then I realize that this person's sponge doesn't have a place, because they were never smart enough to buy a suction cup sponge holder that helps dry your sponge out and keeps your sink looking orderly. Their sponge is homeless and their sink is a disgrace.. Don't be like them. Live your life like its worth a damn.

  I've been using my plastic sponge holder for years. I just remodeled my kitchen and wanted to buy a new holder to replace the plastic one.  I got it about 5 hours ago and had to stick it back on the sink at least 6 times so far. My husband also saw that it fell and he stuck it back on too.  I always wet the suction cups and normally I have to peel them off the sink to clean behind them. Unfortunately,  I can't use the suction cups from the plastic holder, the back is different and they won't fit on the new one.  What a waste of my money,  don't spend yours on this, find another one.

  I wanted something to hold a sponge and metal scrub pad so that they didn't make a mess of the back of my sink, and don't sit in a pool of dirty water.  This solved the problem for me.  It's large enough to hold those two items, and yes, it does stay stuck to the side of my steel sink (at least so far, after a couple of months).  It doesn't rust, it's solid, and I recommend it.Update:After several months of use I'm still happy with this, although I've found that in order to keep the suction cups working well, I have to clean them once in a while.  Not a lot to ask.Second update:I've been using this for a year on my stainless steel sink. About once every couple of weeks it slides down. I wash the suction cups and the part of the sink where I want it to stick and it's good for another couple of weeks. The suction cups are definitely flattening, though, and if I can find some reasonably priced replacements I'll get them.Third update:After about a year the suction cups were flat and would no longer stick. I removed them and found two small suction cups with steel hooks at the hardware store and hung the basket on the hooks. Works fine and should be good for at least another year.

  I wasn't sure this would work because my sink is pounded copper so its not smooth. I found that even though the whole suction cup wouldn't fit on the lip of my granite countertop enough of it does in order to stick. It works well enough that it has only fallen off when I've accidently wacked it with a pan.

  UPDATE: I've used this method on 3 different sinks and had great results on all of them!I bought this knowing full well that the suction cups were the weak point in the design. I figured that I would eventually come up with a better mounting system since the suction cups were working for only a few minutes before giving up, even without the weight of the sponge.Since I had no immediate ideas (well, none that worked) I just left it behind faucet leaning on the backsplash. Last night when I got home, I noticed that my fiancée had moved it to a very peculiar spot. It was in the corner or the sink and it was holding strong.I just moved it to the opposite corner this afternoon, so that it wouldn't be under the drain pan, and I can't believe how good it's holding. It was a little tricky to get both suction cups to stick at first but I figured out a little trick. I was able to stick one side and then slide it over to where it's flat enough to stick the other side. Then you just slide it back over to center it. Be careful that you don't dig the holder into your sink and scratch it while sliding it back and forth.

  So the suction cups don't work. I love the idea of this holder, but it's cheaply made. I bought one for Christmas and found out that one of the suction cups were bent and would not stick at all. So I returned it and it was replaced free of charge, however again one of the suction cups loses it's stickiness with in a couple of hours. I'm not going to waste my time by re-ordering this one or returning it. I think I'll have to go buy additional different suction cups for it.

  I was excited to purchase these filters, as they were cost effective so I could afford to replace them more often. I put the first one in shortly after receiving them a little less than a month ago. It looked fine and fit as expected in my furnace. Fast forward a few weeks, and my house is cold. I have the thermostat set at 69 & the house won't get above 62. I double checked all my windows and doors. I adjusted the thermostat. I was at a loss. As a last ditch effort before an HVAC appointment, I checked the filter (that I had replaced only a few weeks ago) & found it jammed in the furnace, with the wires bowed. When I finally got it out, I saw the filter was damaged and plugging the intake. I replaced it with a different filter and within an hour my house was warm again. Spend a few extra bucks and get a different filter! Not worth the extra stress and potential danger of a defective air filter.

  Sometimes the heaviest and thickest furnace filter isn't the best for your furnace -- THESE Filters are of good quality and will do the job if you replace them every 2-3 months.  I even change them alittle early and my furnace is good as gold (23 year old furnace!)  Love this product.

  In every other disposable furnace filter I've ever used, the support grating looks like metal chicken wire and when installed the grating goes on the side where the blower fan is.  The grating usually prevents the actual filter media from getting pulled towards the blower.These have it the other way and don't use metal.  There's thin strips of plastic every 1/8"" going from one side to the other and the plastic strips appear to be melted to the filter media at every pleat.  The attachment of the plastic strips to the filter media is quite strong in my limited and unscientific tests.  It should work fine but I was confused at first because the air flow arrow on the frame appears to be pointing in the wrong direction compare to every other filter I've ever used, but I'm pretty sure the arrow is correct, this is just a new way of supporting the filter media.Other than that, it's a basic filter.  The size is almost exactly the claimed size which is nice as it fits more snugly into my furnace.  Some of the cheap filters are up to 1/4"" thinner than claimed and 1/2"" less in width and height, but these aren't like that.UPDATE July 8th 2019: After only 2 months installed in my furnace the first filter frame has bent along the bottom edge, see pics.  I've never had a filter bend like this.  These filters have a very weak frame.  I'll be changing them out every 1 month now until I use up the pack of them then not buying this style filter again.  Sadly it's getting harder and harder to find basic low restriction filters which aren't cheap junk, even with the 3M branding on them.

  Great 3M quality and price, I waited to see how they work before reviewing. They work great! The thing to know is that  they are using a new filter support design. Instead of a metal grid on the backside of the filter 3M is using plastic strips on the front side of the filter media. These strips are attached to every pleat every inch or two and will face away from your blower, the airflow arrows are correct on the package. This seems to be the problem some people are having.  If installed backwards the pleats will collapse when the blower comes on and cause airflow problems. Installed correctly the Pleats keep their shape and everything works fine.  I don’t know why they redesigned it I’m sure it’s a money-saving thing but it is what it is. These are still great filters, I will happily reorder these.

  I find it difficult to believe that these were made by 3M. I believe they are knock offs. They are not up to normal 3M quality specs.  Sizing is off, they are flimsy, and the quality varies from filter to filter. They have a completely different air flow and design from any other filter I have seen.  3M would have represented them correctly. I am not surprised other reviewers have had problems with them.  But you get what you pay for.  If they last, I expect them to last half as long.  I’ll use them, but will look for a more reputable supplier who will fairly represent their product next time.

  3M makes a great product this is a filter that needs replacing often. That is because it is not a hugely thick HEPA type. If you have extreme allergies or need a HEPA then you should get another type of filter if you keep it clean house these last between one and two months and they do a great job. I can't believe some of the stupid reviews I've seen from stupid people. I work 42 years for major airline, and several years part-time with a friend that had a heating and air company. I rate these filters as the best filters for the money. If you use the cheap fiberglass ones that you can see right through you're going to be dirtying your coil and your AC unit life will be shortened. I wrote this review for the people that wanted to know the real truth and not listen to the cry babies that don't know what they're talking about

  I was very nervous about using these given the mixed reviews, so hopefully this helps anyone on the fence about using them. I bought two different colors, the gray and the white. The gray definitely has a slight blue-ish cast, so if that is going to bother you use a different brand. The white is a true bright white without any ivory or yellow. Do not count on this matching your existing grout. You will not be able to just touch up a few areas. Just plan on doing the entire room.As to usage, I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom plus a little of the shower with one pen. The shower floor has small hex tile with larger grout lines so that took a little over two pens. Some tips: shake very well when first taking out of the package and any time you start working again after a pause. Depress the tip several times on to a paper plate or directly onto the grout line to get the paint flowing. Press very lightly when going over the grout. The tips lasted almost all the way to the end of my project. If the coverage starts to thin, pause and depress the tip a few more times. I would do about a 1x1 foot area, then pass over it lightly with a damp paper towel to get any overage off the tile. It is pretty forgiving and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely on the tile. If the tip gets too ragged you can pull it out (I used the damp paper towel) and flip it around. This was not a quick task but it went faster than I thought it would.I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!

  This worked like watered down white-out. Glad I tested it in a corner before doing the entire grout! Maybe it'll work for touch-ups around baseboards...Also, this is the last product I'm buying off a Buzzfeed article!! This is the third thing in a row I've gotten after reading their promos to just be completely disappointed and out of $$ bc I can't return it opened out of the packaging. Don't fall for it!

  This is one of those products that has a lot of upsides but several downsides. To preface, I have a roughly 20-square-foot white tile floor in my apartment bathroom. When I moved in, the grout was very discolored and made the tile look dirty. I was extremely skeptical about this product, but it was a reasonably priced solution and a top seller on Amazon, so I gave it a shot.I followed the very simple directions on the pen (clean floors, remove cap, shake pen, use), and was initially amazed by the results. My nearly gray tile grout was being transformed back to white. Although, after I got through about 6 square-feet of tile, the pen tip started to fall apart. Was it still usable? Yes. Did it hinder the quality of the paint job? Also yes.Additionally, the paint ran out much quicker than expected. I was able to get a single coat on the entire tile floor, but the 60 meters of coverage they claim is a little far fetched.Nonetheless, my tile floors look good. A couple tips (no pun intended): get two pens because the coverage is less than advertised, apply 2 coats, REALLY clean the floors before you start (I didn’t deep clean nearly enough and the grime made the paint job much harder), consider another solution unless you have white tile as well (I feel as if this pen would not be great if you needed to be precise), and don’t push as hard on the tip to increase the pen’s longevity.Hope this helps! Still a good product, just a couple things to keep in mind before you buy.

  We just bought a house, and one of the biggest eyesores was the downstairs toilet area because the grout and tiles are so old and miscolored.I'm so glad I tried out these pens, it covered almost the entire bathroom floor (and probably could have colored more, but I was being fairly careless and was wiping up large areas of paint when wiping off tiles).Unfortunately, after a week the coloring seemed to go away some. I am not sure if the pain 'soaked in' to the grout or if we were just too quick to put the rugs back over top.Overall, though, it looks marvelous! Up close, it's a little iffy looking but what guest is going to be that close to really notice?*Update: we went to Lowes and bought some of their grout pens when these started to run out. Theirs had a harder/wider tip, which got more paint on the tile, but overall seemed to cover better.*

  These things are awesome!  I cleaned my bathroom tile grout first because the lady that lived there before me really let it go.  A few places stayed stained and I was worried it wouldn't cover them, but all grout areas are bright white and look new now!  The first picture is showing as I was cleaning the dirty grout.  The second picture is after I cleaned it all and used the grout pen.  I'm very happy with this product!

  Bought to clean up the pitted/cracked shower grout in an apt.  If I owned the place, I'd have properly re-grouted & sealed.  For the price, this did the trick & made the shower look sharp/clean.  The paint dispenses easily & is pretty simple to apply evenly (and if you screw up, just use sponge to wipe off where you colored outside the lines).  No idea how it'll hold up over time, but it made it through its first cleaning test (spray down with Kaboom tile cleaner)  For my situation (i.e. it's an apt, so not willing to put in the time or $ to fully re-grout), it worked.

  This is the BEST for tying trees and vining vegetables! It's custom fit, it's soft on the underside and it won't rub vines raw like twine.

  I am using this velcro to tie up my tomato plants. This is my first time growing any kind of plant so this is my first time staking a plant. Many people told me to use old t-shirts to tie my tomato plants. I chose to use these instead and I am very happy that I did I got the large roll for less than $8 and I cut Iength needed with my scissors I put  the soft side against my tomato plant and the velco on the outside. These hold a lot of weight. I will definitely repurchase after I've used all of this roll. I was debating whether or not to get the velcro or a little round plastic clips. I'm glad I chose the velcro that way I can choose any length that I need even if I need it to go around 2x4 and the tomato plant it's no problem. I saved most of the velcro  form last year. I will use again.

  I go through a roll of this velcro tape every summer.  They are handy not only for tying up vines, but securing hanging items from blowing around too much in a storm (like my windchime) and for securing wires (which are on items like an outdoor fountain).  I also use the wrap in the fall when bundling up the tender plants in preparation for winter (like my bamboo and Chilean rhubarb.)  The tape stays put, can be reused multiple times, does not cut into the stalk of the plant and is easily trimmed to size.  It does not deteriorate outdoors despite rain, sun, wind and snow.  Highly recommend.

  I use this for loads of things! Now I wish it came in different colors.I started using it in the garden to hold up tomato and bean plants, then migrated to train indoor plants (it nearly camouflages itself), and now use it for almost anything I used to use twist ties or elastic bands for.The ones I use outdoors have lasted thee years so far and still can be adjusted. They are gentle and don’t strangle plants and other things (like string and wire does).It’s easy to cut and adjust, doesn’t stick to everything ir touches, can be washed, and looks nice.Maybe best of all, my mom, who has severe arthritis in her hands, can easily use this without pain or struggle.The first time I bought it was at a garden center, so my mind was stuck in the gardening tunnel for awhile. But really, it’s got infinite possibilities.Don’t expect the same kind of strength that the usual Velcro has, though. It does the job it’s meant to do and a little more, and what more can you ask?

  This is my go to for training plants on totems or supports for my houseplants! You just cut as you go and you don't need very much with each use.  It can be used for branch support training on totems & I've also previously used it to support a broken stem. I've never been disappointed, it's a great product that stands up well to wear, water, potting medium etc this is as far as an indoor atmosphere.  I've never use this product on outside gardening.

  I have been buying this off and on over the years, and its GREAT. The best thing for plants, and staking them up, or typing errant vines, or whatever!  It has just the right amount of stick. Can be removed easily if you need to, but it holds wonderfully.  It is kind of plants, unlike using something that cuts into the vines. Its gentle and soft.  What a simple, yet wonderful invention! I can't tell you how many plants I've used this for over the years. Highly recommend!

  I am an avid gardener, and have been looking for a good way to stake various plants, shrubs, and flowers. I have been buying the large rolls of twist-tie material for years, and using that to hold various plants up. But, the twist-ties also cut into the stems of whatever you are staking, sometimes even breaking the stem.I was not aware that this stretchy tape existed until I performed a search on Amazon. I have now used it on a few plants, it is far superior to the twist-ties. This plant tie is stretchy, much wider than the twist ties, and easier to use. It can be stuck to itself, just like Velcro.  But, I live in a very harsh climate area and did not completely trust that just sticking the tape to itself would survive this climate. I went ahead and tied the tape, I feel more certain that the ties will not come lose when they are tied together.  However, the tape does seem to stick together easily, perhaps those in milder climates would experience no issues with the stick together method.This tie material also has another advantage, it will stretch as the plant grows, another advantage over the twist tie system. I am pleased with this product, but only time will tell much about its durability. I will write an update after this tape has been in use for a longer period of time. Until then, this seems to be a nice and easy way to ensure that certain plants remain in the upright position.

  I'm doing reforestation work with a few thousand small trees, and these ties, combined with lengths of split bamboo, are an easy way to keep the trees straight and supported.  Easy to cut and put in place.  I bought several smaller roles before I started buying this larger size (for a small cost savings) and they've been great.  High recommendation for use in securing small trees, vines, small branches, etc.  I've also been using them too keep roles of extension cord, rope, etc., neat and untangled.  High recommendation!

  I live in an old home and we are at the point in life where we have done all the big repairs we are going to do. We have holes in quite a few screens which my spouse promised to fix with his mystical screen hole patching prowess. That was years ago and I’m tired of getting eaten alive. I bought a roll of this and in 10 minutes every screen was patched.This product cuts cleanly even with mediocre scissors. It adheres to the existing screen neatly and without a lot of pressure or fuss. I’d say not to worry too much about which color you choose as this product is quite obvious in use. It is really not going to blend. However I don’t care; my screens no longer are mosquito boulevards and the product stays put. I’m thrilled, one more job off the list.

  I read a bunch of the reviews before purchasing. Yes, you can see the repaired spots, bur a few minor repairs here and there does not bother me. My husband went around and cleaned the spots on the outside of the screens where we were going to apply patches. He first did one on a bedroom screen and was not crazy about the look. He used one piece to cover 2 holes, so more repair mesh was used. I would have done them separately. I did our patio screen later and used smaller pieces in just the spots where a mosquito could get through. He agreed the smaller patches were less noticeable. I was really happy that the plastic backing was easy to remove and the adhesive was very sticky. We chose to put our patches on the outside in case the cats were apt to mess with them and because others said it looked better from inside the house if the patches were applied outside.

  This worked well for repairing a 3 inch cut in one of my screens.  It was easy to use and cut with a regular pair of scissors, and the adhesive was perfect.  It was very easy to see, especially on the side that I had taped, but looked better from the outside.  I wish it blended in slightly better, but it was a lot cheaper than replacing the whole screen so 4 stars.  I think it’s best use is holding a screen together for those small issues until it gets to the point that the whole screen needs to be done—a temporary fix for minor issues.

  Holy cow! This stuff WORKS! I had been using regular packing tape to patch up my screen door that was riddled with holes and tears.. but those mosquitoes were making their way in.. and it looked terrible. I picked up a roll of this just to check it out.. and, man, the repair is practically like I installed a new screen! I did follow one other's review here about installing it ON THE OUTSIDE.. that definitely was true. But the door looks MUCH more normal now.. with not a single weak spot. I thought it was going to be tape with the net pattern printed on.. IT'S REAL NETTING with adhesive on one side.. so it really is a solid repair! Highly recommend!

  Good stuff! I had hoped for something that was very adhesive, and this is it. I was replacing screens and since I am not a professional at that I ended up tearing the screen at the spline in places. I used this to cover those points and seal it off. This is exactly what I needed. I had to cut it in half to get the width I needed, but that was easy. So is the application. The backing is easy to get off and it presses right in to place, and stays. It might not match the exact color of the screen, but it is sealed, and beats throwing the whole screen away because I screwed up.

  Love it, it took 10 minutes to fix four screens instead of hours of sewing patches. It is great for small patches, not for large ones. It doesn't let air flow through so if you have a large patch, put a piece of regular screen over area to be patched and use this on the outer edges and it works fine

  I have had a few rips in my screens around the house. I decided to get this tape to stick around the rips. However, no matter how I tried, the adhesive would never stick to the screen. Moreover, even if I just left it on the screen, they are extra opaque which makes the screen look worse. I've taken a look at the few images users have left and they look so unprofessional. Especially if you're proud of your house.Invest in a screen repair kit. It costs less! Takes about the same amount of time to take out and put in a new screen as the time I spent looking up a kit and writing this review (slight exaggeration) . I wish I knew about screen replacement kits before I bought this product. I hope this helps anyone investing in this.

  My ONLY issue with this product is that the mesh of the tape is slightly smaller than the mesh of my windows, so it doesn't blend it very well. But, it's better than a hole and cheaper than replacing the screen and it still lets air through, so I am very happy.

  We have bought an Intex pool for the last 5 years for the kiddos to splash in.  The last 2 years they went super cheap (underweight fillter, poor design, etc) so we went looking for a replacement.  This pool fit the bill well.When we pulled it out I was a bit concerned that it did not seem ""substantial"" enough but with a filter that runs super quiet (about half as loud as Intex) and a design that has stood up to months of abuse, I am very happy with this purchase.As with any pool, you need to have a floating cholorinator or some other chemical system otherwise it will get cloudy.  But after the failures of the Intex models. I was very pleased by this filter system.  It quickly cleared the cloudiness and kept the water well circulated with the barest amount of chlorine.It looses one star because after 3 months of use it is starting to sag a bit more then the Intex did but by this point last summer we had abandoned our Intex because the filter broke.So, all in all, very pleased.  Good choice.Update - we had some leaking issues after about 2 months and Summer Waves' Customer Service was amazing.  Not only were they incredibly friendly (and US based!!!) but they did a great job fixing the issue at no cost to me.All in all, this is our new go to pool.

  We wanted a pool for the summer without spending a lot of money. I was disappointed how expensive pools were (probably due to increased demand from the effects of COVID19), and we ended up getting this one for about $180-$190 shipped. It doesn't look very sturdy in most people's photos, so I thought it was going to be a piece. Thankfully, I was wrong! This pool is so much nicer than what I thought we were getting. I still don't know if it'll last more than a season, but we are happy with what we got. It was easy to set up. We followed the instructions for the filter because of some reviews that said it burnt out right away. Ours has been working great for two hours now. The instructions to say to run it 2.5 hours a day, so that's what we intend to do. We're very happy so far!Update: We've had our pool for one month now, and we're still happy with our purchase. We ended up buying a pool cover, chlorine tablets for the filter, test strips to make sure the chlorine is at a safe level, extra filter cartridges, and a shock treatment. Also, we bought a vinyl patch kit. Why a patch kit? Well, we got a hole on the rim of our pool, and it started to deflate! We initially patched it with flex tape that we had, which worked for a few days but eventually let air out. We re-patched it with flex tape a couple more times while we waited for the vinyl patch kit to arrive. It's been patched with the vinyl patch it for about a week now and is doing fine. So, you may want to consider having a vinyl patch kit on hand just in case you get a hole in the rim of your pool, too.

  I  purchased one of these pools as a replacement for one I had already owned  that I had purchased from big lots for a cheaper price.  I had no problems with that pool  until it had gone algae in it and when I emptied it and send it out to dry my dogs ruined it. So I purchased the same pool on Amazon for more money because the local stores had run out of inventory.  I set the pool up filled it with water leaked all over my backyard. The company sent me another one.  Set the pool up filled it up, it too had a leak.  Finally I was sent one more pool. It's set up perfectly, filled up perfectly and after one usage it began to leak. I will never buy a Summer Waves product ever again.I am also concerned about the company that supplies the pools.  None of the pools that were sent to me came in your original summer waves packaging. They all had been repositioned into new cardboard boxes.of the pools so I don't know if the pools came direct from the manufacturer.

  We ordered this on July figuring it was so hot we could use it through August. The pool had a leak somewhere and the top inflatable portion wouldn't inflate. We had put water in it already. When we called there was a whole list of checks to follow, one being putting food coloring in a full pool to see where the leak was... Really? Then empty all the water and fix it ourselves? Besides the top rim not inflating. We couldn't just return it for one that didn't leak. It's a big item and for the $50 or so bucks, not worth the aggravation of arguing with them.

  Easy to do.  Gaskets for filter are cheap. Both intake and outlet leaked. Would highly recommend using some type of adhesive/sealant between the gaskets and pool surface. Also keep in mind that if you live in a hot climate, the water quickly becomes the temperature of a hot tub. Mine has been up for a day and too hot to be in. (SC)

  This tap measure is just what I wanted. My last one, different brand , just snapped, so I thought I'd have to shell out another 25 bucks for a new one. Came across this Komelon ,and it not only has the self stop feature, but also the retract button that won't smack you in the face. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, for one reason. The hard plastic packaging. There are layers upon layers of this material, and it takes forever to get it off. I needed scissors and a utility knife to get it out. And it was very dangerous, because of the sharp edges from the plastic and tools, could have very easily cut myself. I was thoroughly ticked off by the time I was done. The hardest part was getting the belt clip free, as it is swathed above it, on the sides, and below it where it's screwed in place. I can't believe some moron came up with this design, and other morons approved it. There have to be dozens of easier ways to package this tape measure, like maybe a cardboard box, but they picked this one. There's no way I'll buy another when this one bites the dust, unless they change the packaging. I'd rather pay the extra money, than to go through the grief of opening this one.

  I bought this tape mainly because it's an autolocking tape to use on small jobs and because of its size and weight. I'm very happy with that. It feels good in the hand, is very light.The main numbers are relatively large and easy to read. Part of having a small, light tape is having a small tape blade, so the numbers and other markings are also smaller. If you use it for difficult jobs, expecting to have a long tape standout and large numbers, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want a tape that you can easily carry and use for small jobs, this one is a nice one. The autolocking feature is well worth the price of the tape alone, to me. I just love not having to fuss with trying to lock a tape, especially when you're trying to move quickly.

Best feature is that you don't have to push button for it to stay out.  You push button to recall.  See my YouTube video of this:  Sexy rexy green self lock 25-foot power tape measure.I love the looks of it.  The feel of it.  The wide, easy to read tape.  Super buy!

  I own several of these tape measures. They are cost efficient, and well-made. The tape is medium duty, and you can take it out about 6ft or so before in snaps over. I appreciate the self-lock feature, and it retracts smoothly. The retracting mechanism feels solid, and I don't anticipate it failing anytime soon. As long as Komelon continues to put forth quality tools and a decent price point, I will continue to be a customer. Definitely Recommend!

  This was a replacement for a 25’ Stanley I’ve had for over 40 years. It is a bit larger and bulkier than the Stanley, but the Stanley was smaller in every way including the print on the rule.I was amazed how smoothly it pulled out and the lovely auto lock feature. No longer do I fear getting sliced by my tape measure!To retract it, gently press on the large green button.It is US measurement only. I’d have liked a combo with metric, but it is easy to convert inches to centimeters.I like it!

  Komelon had the 1st process to effectively laminate Teflon to measuring tapes many decades ago. This is a great tape for 30%-50% less than brand/known names, but meets or exceeds their performance. Large numbers, easy to read yellow black tape. Good rigidity when extended. Long lasting, smooth and effective Teflon coating. Moderate weight on the belt for a 25 foot tape indicating good steel thickness overall. Sturdy, easy find fluorescent green case with rubber padding and comfort contours makes for a nice working tape. We replaced our favorite decades-old Komelon measuring tape that a careless friend nicked with a circular saw on a cutting table...  highly recommended for price, function, durability and value.

  There are certainly less expensive surge suppressors out there, but these are very well made and well worth the price. I always prefer the angled plug and recommend them over the standard outlet to ensure you get and maintain a solid connection - anything less can defeat the purpose of using one IMO. The braided cord is a nice feature and a lot more flexible than the standard cord normally used. It makes it much easier to bundle up and wire tie any excess when mounting them under a desk like in my application.Some of the nicest surge suppressors I have ever purchased. I can give these my highest recommendation without hesitation. If and when I need more, I will be buying these again.

  Overall I like these. It's very well priced for a 2-pack, and the flat (and angled) plug is great for outlets sitting behind dressers/beds/other furniture. The sockets on the surge protector are decently tight but not excessively so compared to an APC I bought recently. The fabric (nylon?) sleeving on the cord is a nice touch, although the choice of a grey pattern seems odd vs black, given the black surge protector.I have only two minor complaints* The reset/off switch is a little easier to trigger than I would have liked. It's not to the point where I'm worried about accidentally setting it off, but it does feel lighter than other ones I've tried* The sockets don't have covers, so it's easy for dust and other stuff to fall into unused outlets. I knew this when I purchased itAs for actual surge protection, I'm not equipped (or knowledgeable enough) to rate this, but I'm hoping it actually works.

  I have a heavy printer on a stand with outlet directly behind it. Added an expansion outlet for printer and other items. Printer cable and another are very thick with very deep plug ends. So my stand would be a good 5-6"" or so from the wall. Always something falling behind it and the only way to get it back was to move the printer (80#) and the stand (very heavy). AAAAGGGHHHH!I chose this over flat outlets because I'd still have the depth of the thick cord and plug in. This item has a 'flatter"" plug than most. And I can set the strip on printer stand and plug everything in. It is close enough to the wall I don't have the worry of anything dropping behind it. And I love that it has surge protection and USB ports, very handy. Eliminates a few items I'd had plugged in and I don't have to charge phones and tablet one at a time because their plugs take up most of outlet space. Being long makes it easier to plug in odd sizes, I can still use the other plugs. And it feels very solid - I'm happy with it.The only thing that would make it perfect, is to make this so it plugs in with the cord running UP instead of down. Every place I have space trouble needs the cord going UP not down.'

  Nicely built surge protector.  Plugs are evenly spaced so you can fit multiple plugs.  It has two usb charging ports as well.  The cord is thick and long.  This was a great purchase and value

  Purchased these as I was upgrading my work/gaming area and wanted enough power strips to handle current and future electrical needs.  The units are great on multiple levels as they have an offset plug so the other outlet isn't blocked by the cord.  The cord itself, a good 5' has a braid covering opposed to the plastic covering making it sooooooo much easier to manipulate.  The unit(s) themselves have 2 USB ports each to accommodate  any dedicated  appliances.  This is in addition to 4 three prong outlets.  They are surge protected which is nice on top of a circuit breaker system installed at the residence.  The lights are a nice, subtle green color that don't light up the room unlike some other power strips.  Wished I had seen these earlier.

  This set of power strips is well made and great value for the price. It has a long cord and its braided design seems to be more durable than the conventional plastic ones. I am currently using one in my living room with 1 more to spare.  has been using it for almost a month now, so far no issues..happy with the purchase...

  So I bought these last July. One of them has quit working & I contacted customer support. They immediately refunded half the purchase price. Originally I had thought they were blowing me off (thus my original one star review) but you contact them through Amazon then the response comes via email. Seems odd. Anyway these things work great until they don't. Honestly I would have rather gotten a replacement since now I will have to buy another one.

  I bought these to mount to a utility cart so I'd have power and USB charging capability, I saw this quote on the description, ""with right angle plug; 2 Keyhole mounting tabs for installation in a wide variety of applications."" and dumbly assumed it would be mountable.Apparently in China they use screws with no head or something I'm not familiar with, but as you can see there is no slot inside for the head of a screw to grab on to and hold, someone forgot to create a mold with the proper slot for mounting. Now I'm going to have to disassemble and make my own mount, something I was avoiding, hence the purchase.Not worth the money or the time.

  Ok, I had NO IDEA how well these worked!!!!  We have had a scorpion problem in our home, here in Kingman, AZ, for quite some time.  When I got stung in my bed at 3 a.m., I invested in tons of bug spray, and this flashlight.The type of scorpion we have here is the ""bark scorpion"", and BOY DO THEY GLOW when this light hits them.  I could see them from across the yard!  A good 20 feet away!!!!  I feel safer with this light than I do in the daytime!  I'm totally freaked out now, because we found scorpions all over the foundation of our house, crawling in-and-out underneath the stucco.  We killed at least 15 the first night!!!!  We also found a little one inside the house.I'm writing this review, because I don't think I'll sleep tonight :(. I would highly recommend this light.  It's like a spotlight!  It's totally my new favorite toy!!!

  This thing is so good. It shows every single stain over the years where our dog peed when he was a puppy and still having accidents on the carpet. We thought we cleaned but you can clearly see all the spots. It also shows where dust is hiding that you don't even see when the lights are on. So in conclusion, this UV light is almost too good. It shines brightly over a large area at least 6 feet away.  Now I can never lie on the carpet again cause i know where all the invisible stains are. They should sell this as a bundle with a carpet steam cleaner. Ordering two more as gifts.  Haha!

  I originally purchased this to go along with my halloween costume as I was an agent from CSI. But, one day my husband and I decided it would be fun to go around our house with the light to see what we would find. We aren't the original owners of the house and it has been passed down a few times. The 1/2 bath that our guests needed to be bombed and re-built, the walls had some interesting splatters on them and our upstairs carpet (which is original to the house) was a bunch of small stains that have melded together to create one huge glowing monster stain. Needless to say, I ran out the next day and doused our house in bleach and we will be replacing the upstairs carpet soon! Beware: purchase this at your own risk knowing that you may want to gut your house! lol!

  Purchased December 2017 for $8.95 with free shipping.This 51-LED Flashlight is Fantastic! I purchased a smaller 9 LED ""UV"" light about a year ago and it was junk, lots of LEDs are much, much better.From what I can tell every tiny little protein-based speck — protein-based as in pretty much anything that comes out of a living breathing creature — glows like a big bright neon sign.Lovely.This flashlight should come with a warning advising us that we ""may"" need to stock up on cleaning supplies and have a few extra hours set aside for addressing the interesting little things which we ""may"" find the first time we use it. What has been seen cannot be unseen — in my own ""clean"" house I was amazed and appalled to find far too many little invisible-to-the-naked-eye specks, splatters, and streaks. Ugh.The flashlight takes 3 standard AA batteries. They were easy to install.The on/off button is located on the side where it is comfortably within thumb reach.If you have teenagers, plan accordingly. Privileges are earned.I did not in any manner receive any compensation whatsoever for this review. Unfortunately.

  I loaded this up with batteries as soon as I got it and in daylight (inside of course) took it out to where I know that one of the 3 cats in the house had wet before. I had no idea what the horror that I was about to discover.As I swept the bluish-purple beam across the carpet and along the baseboards, what was reflected back to me in brilliant white was a story of struggle, of frustration, a fight for dominance and standing, a battlefield of stains and sprayings. The 3 little kitties act nice and purr and softly meow with one another when we're around, but buried deep within each of their dark, furry little hearts must lurk a dark force that compels them to out spray each other. Either that or they are all colluding against me; peeing on the walls and carpet when I'm not looking, even though they go out 5x a day and have 2 litterboxes in the house.The good news is that this flashlight is a secret weapon for humans to fight back. I've started stalking the halls and their favorite marking spots with my water gun which I use to generously douse any cat who so much as hesitates in his or her passage through the hallway. I bought some enzymatic cleaner that breaks down the urine stains and erases all trace of their work.My sudden advantage of knowing exactly where everything was happening, coupled with the super soaker, it has completely thrown the cats into a state of confusion. They don't know HOW I know, but they know that I know, and they no longer pee anywhere that I can find. I'm in charge now!This flashlight truly tips the odds in your favor!

  Ever smoke a prime rib? Need to truss a big ole turkey? I watch too much food network and like to smoke meats. This is what you need to properly truss and wrangle your meat into a presentable package. You also have enough twine left over to make crafts, tie up children or your significant other. Great price, great product, all natural. Buy it.

  I loved crocheting bags with this twine! It's super sturdy and great for market totes (also easy to wash since it's cotton). It is quite heavy though since it is 16-ply but I don't mind the weight as long as it's sturdy.

  Used this product to secure a bacon weave to a pork loin.  Very large roll of cooking string for a low price, easy to open and cut to desired lengths.  I was worried the string would pull the bacon off on removal, but you can see from the pictures it came off very easily.  I did let the lion rest about 10 mins before removing.  Highly recommend for the price and amount you receive, plus the effectiveness is great!

  I grew up in a generation where we always had a ball of twine in the house. Whether it was there to help pull out a tooth, tie turkey legs together or bind a package together for mailing, the twine was always at hand. It is so nice to have that again. You'd be amazed at how many times it comes in handy. Better than Scotch tape!!!

  This is the perfect twine for trussing large pieces of meat for rotisserie grilling, especially chickens.  And why do we truss chickens?  Because we don't truss lawyers.
