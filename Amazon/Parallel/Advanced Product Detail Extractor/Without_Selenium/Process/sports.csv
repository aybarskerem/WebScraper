  We were in search of a lower cost option. After researching, we felt confident that we wanted it, this is good for us to stay at home and do cycle classes.There are several advantages for this bike:Compact and save space. While you exercise you can Watch TV or Ipad at the same time. The Seat: The seats are ergonomically designed, comfortable Cushion while you ride the bike.All of the components seem to be well designed and built. Bike assembly took about 20 minutes.The operation is very smooth. There aren't any hick-ups, slips, bumps, etc. when pedaling. It goes from a very easy spin all the way to simulating climbing the steepest mountain. The unit is also sturdy when standing up and pedaling, whether it be for a sprint or just standing up to stretch the legs for a few seconds while pedaling.The bike price vs. its quality is good to have it.

  Due to COVID the gyms are closed and I am unable to go to spinning classes, so I was looking on Amazon for an affordable but good exercise bike.After searching for some affordable and compact exercise bike, I found this SOVNIA bike on Amazon.Arrived in one box, the assembly was easy didn't take longer than 20 minutes and the bike was ready to go. Seems like a good quality built, sturdy and well made.Has almost everything what the more expensive bikes have, but it doesn't bother me that doesn't have the clips on the pedal or the computer doesn't show the resistance/gear.I used it almost daily for the past two weeks and definitely is well-made and seems very durable.PROS:- easily adjustable resistance/tension (come also with an extra resistance pad);- soft but well built handles;- tablet holder - perfect to watch virtual spinning classes;- probably the best seats I ever used on a stationary bike;CONS:- I miss the gear in the bike computer (but definitely isn't a deal breaker).Long story short, the cost of this exercise bike, ease of setup and quality makes it an excellent purchase. Thumbs up!

  As we know, during the time that‚Äôs I am writing this, there is a raging pandemic going on, all over the globe. And because of this, my father tends to stay inside more as an extra precaution. But I figured that since we can‚Äôt really go anywhere, we might as well buy an exercise machine for in-home use. I decided to go with a bike because treadmills are always very expensive and my father rode his bike a lot. I was a bit skeptical at first but according to my father, he said that this is ‚Äúwhat he needed to get moving again.‚Äù He now uses it every morning and evening and has already lost 5 lbs! I decided test the machine myself and I was amazed at how smooth the peddling was. There is a wide range of options for the amount of incline you want on the bike. A great led screen to monitor how far you have traveled and an excellent placement of the cup holder. I haven‚Äôt seen my father this active in more than a year! I would say that this purchase has definitely made the year go off to a great start!

  Easy assembly, I only took less than half hour, even I only read first few pages of the manual. (hint: the enclosed wrench is useful, it may work better than your own).The quality is pretty good, no chemical/peculiar  smell.I ride a few days so far, it works better than I expected. I use it for half hour of exercise daily, moved it to the center of the garage when begin the exercise, moved it back to the corner when finished (my house is small, so the bike is placed in the garage). Hah, then I felt the most useful feature is those two small front wheels.

  I got this bike for over 4 weeks now and it is sitting in my WFH office. I‚Äôm not boojee on equipments, all I want just a bike with easy storage and help me exercise during this pandemic. Quite surprisingly, this budget-friendly bike serves my demands really well...It was easy to assemble everything, I probably got it done within 20mins. Nice part is that there is an extra for every screw. So in case you lose one, you can alway have a backup.Bike's frame is very sturdy, and it didn't give any flimsy feelings.The digital monitor provides real-time distance, speed, time, and estimated burned calories. It also records the last exercise details. I am biking with some exercise Apps, so I generally don‚Äôt pay much attentions to the monitor. The digital device holder is big enough for both iPhone or iPad, and they fit perfectly.The bike uses direct-contact brake system as its resistance, but I can barely hear any significant noise from its wool brake pad.I got two more family members using this bike frequently, and we kept it running about 3-4 hrs a day. So far we are really happy with this bike!

  I've only ridden the bike once so far. I paid $260 for the bike and it's solid at that price point. It's smooth, quiet and easy to adjust the tension on the fly. The seat could be a little more comfortable. The handle bars shimmy a little no matter how much you tighten them and the seat will move side to side a little bit, but nothing that is a deal breaker. The display is very basic and there is no pulse reading which would have been nice, but overall it's a well built and easy to assemble bike that I would recommend.If I encounter any problems, I will come back and update my review.

  My ‚Äúcold weather ride‚ÄúLately I‚Äôve been missing the nicer weather and being able to ride a couple hours a day. But, it is the time of year where my exercising has to go indoors. After carefully studying all my opinions, I chose the Yosuda. What a fantastic bike! I wish that I had known about this bike sooner, as I wouldn‚Äôt have to spend most of our midwestern riding weather working off what I couldn‚Äôt take off during the colder months.And, what a durable ride. I have designated my Yosuda, my ‚Äúcold-weather ride‚Äù.From the beginning, this bike was for me: unbelievable price with FREE SHIPPING, very easy assembly, high-quality parts, and (most of all) a solid & comfortable ride.

  I love these leggings! I work a very physically demanding Healthcare job, & HLTPRO can take all my work activities while still being fashionable and super comfortable.Super soft and sizes are pretty accurate, if you have any doubts - size up 1 size. The pockets are the best part about these pants. They'll hold your phone & keys etc and keep em safe. Items don't fall out while you are active.Very opaque & no show; burpee approved! Ì†ΩÌ∏âÌ†ΩÌ≤ØAlso, check out HLTPRO's super cute designed compression socks. They don't roll down!

  Excellent, truly high waist, soft, comfy, three pockets, even if I don't look like the model it's firm enough to keep everything in the right place. The colors are beautiful, I bought the blue one and the wine color.The Medium size was made exactly for me: perfect fit.And yes, I do recommend it.

  I bought the capri version of these and got a small. Based on the size guide they should have fit perfectly but they are extremely tight, and I had to struggle to get them on. Then they wouldn't fit all the way anyway. They are very tight. It's possible they need to be stretched out to be worn but that seems unlikely as there isn't much room to gain unless the stitching comes out. Basically, if you get the capris, you may want to try the next size up. I still gave these a five star rating, though, because the material is very soft, the pockets are awesome, and the style is super cute. If they fit, they'd be the perfect leggings and I am planning on buying the medium as soon as I can.

  Update:The company reached out to me and offered a refund for these pants since they weren‚Äôt what I expected. I found their customer service very professional, and was pleased to hear that they wanted to make my purchase right, even though it was mainly my misunderstanding on what kind of material these pants were made of. They are probably great for yoga, but not so much my high intensity workouts. Changed to 5 star review for exemplary customer service!These leggings are soft and are great for lounging around the house, but the material is NOT made for working out. Maybe I misunderstood the description, but these don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre meant for sweating in. They are soft fabric, like pajama pants. I will be keeping these for lounging around the house, but not for exercise.

  These are so beautiful and pretty..My problem is I actually sized up cause I like a looser fit..These according to their size chart should be a 20/22..I got the 2x large..I normally wear a size 16 pants as reference and been buying an x large in other brands that fit beautifully..I can wear down to a size 12 in some brands.. And my legs are pretty slim.. Just big hips..These are big on my waist but so tight on my legs it felt like compression stockings..So tight it was pulling the waist of the pant down cause the fabric was being tugged mercifully!I considered washing hoping they would loosen but for this much money I will sadly return..I loved this green color though..If you are tiny legged or love bondage the green is this beautiful hunter green with hints of gray and black..My dream color Ì†ΩÌ∏ç

  I live in leggings, so I was excited to try these. First off, they are super soft...like I could sleep in these soft. They are not that typical lycra material that suffocates you.  I love the pockets, because umm hello, who doesn't. But if you are looking for tummy control, these are not for you. Yes, they are high rise, but there is no compression. I got a Large, but I probably could've used a Medium to make them feel a little bit tighter.For the price, I think they are a great buy. I will definitely buy more colors.

  Got this after my charge 2 died and wow is it and upgrade I really love it so far! Fair warning though on some things I didn‚Äôt realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you‚Äôre exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to ‚Äúwork properly‚Äù I don‚Äôt like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven‚Äôt had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way. My boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when I toss and turn at night I don‚Äôt accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off.

  I won't be like everyone who gives a bad review because they clearly got a dud (or user-error as it often is). I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.

  Fitbit's App:Let me start by saying, the Fitbit app is unparalleled for sleep, diet and water tracking. I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.

  I finally received my Fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen. I followed all directions, which is charging it and pairing it up to my phone. But as it was paring, the screen just turned black and when my phone tries to finish the set up and asks me for a 4 number pin, I can't type them in because I can't see them. I tried a reset by placing the fitbit on a charger, and nothing happened. There is a vibration when I press the button, but nothing more. I really needed this to work by tomorrow and now this happens. It's a great disappointment.

  They roll something terrible! I have tried to double the bands, and they still roll. Then they stick to themselves and it take a while to get them back to normal. An hour workout will turn into 2 with these bands.

  I got these for 80 Day obsession in 5'2 130 lbs and they are constantly rolling never had them not roll. So sad, just buy the beach body ones and save your money. It is very uncomfortable when they roll and I would rather focus on my workout instead of the rolling band.

  All of the bands have broken.  They all break at the spot where they join the band to make a loop.In general the bands have a good amount of resistance and the 5 included are a good mix from lowest to highest resistance. I have been using them for IT Band rehab for the past few months, starting with the lowest resistance. But after a few weeks of use they stretch at the joint and then break. I just move up to the next higher resistance and, however they are all broken now.If you do buy these don't expect them to last long.

  I have had these bands for several weeks, I use them daily, and thus far they have been perfect. I had never really integrated resistance band exercises into my routine but I am glad i did. These bands are great for a bunch of very effective workouts on your upper and lower body. I wasn‚Äôt sure how best to use them but luckily they come with a very straightforward pamphlet that covers a bunch of great excercises. The carrying case is also a nice plus because without it they would add clutter for sure. I definitely recommend! Edit: unfortunately after a month or so my heavy has ripped...so not quite as durable as I had hoped.

  Horrible quality. Super flimsy and no resistance worth trying to work out with unless possibly for an elderly person, but they fold/roll immediately. I unpackaged and bypassed to x heavy black band as all others were not worth trying. As soon as I put on and did one m9ve it folded as shown in picture. Bummer... would rate 0 if I could. I don't even work out much, was hoping to at home with these.

  I have huge boobs and it‚Äôs a blessing and a curse. I struggle to find tape strong enough to hold them up right without peeling off from sweat and without it hurting like crazy when you peel it off or leaving residue. Well ladies, this tape holds EM up really nicely, can withstand the heat, and removes easily without leaving any residue. I will say though, removing the tape from your nipple does hurt a bit (maybe I‚Äôm just too sensitive), so I would cover your nipples and then tape over them. But I recommend this tape for sure! It almost looks like a tube top on me lol.

  I‚Äôve got boobs the size of medium watermelons, G cups...to say I was SKEPTICAL is underplaying it. BUT, dang! I got the tape for a Halloween wedding, I wore a plunging v neck dress and ya girl didn‚Äôt need her 6 kids breastfeeding boobs flapping out and ruining the party or just like falling to my knees!  So I got this tape with minimal hope when it arrived looking like an ace bandage and some pasties and I was so wrong! The flower nipple covers are plush, perfect for hiding even the MOST aggressive nips, the adhesive for the flower itself would be great alone for a smaller chested lady! Now the tape, that stuff is MAGIC, it‚Äôs stretchy so you don‚Äôt lose natural movements and it‚Äôs also perfect for keeping your curves and not squaring you off. A little goes a LONG way because of the stretch so from under boob to shoulder you need a lot less than you think if you want to haul those chachas up! I got drunk, I got sweaty, danced, jumped and all the fun things...stayed til I made a conscious and valiant effort to remove. I will say I had some abrasion from the tape but I also have super sensitive skin. 10/10 recommended

  This is my second order for this boobie tape. I am a 42 yo woman, size 14 with D cups.  I would definitely recommend and plan on ordering again.A few key notes to consider:Pros:- Strong adhesive- Tape is very stretchy and flexible- Used 3 strips for excellent hold; 2 strips for good hold- Used enough tape to go about an inch under my boob to about an inch over my shoulder- Used the nipple petals and they are comfortable. They have a sticky adhesive but it's not super strong so  doesn't hurt to take off. - Lines on the back of tape so you know exactly how long to cut for each strip to be even - Held up to dancing and a night on the town (6-8 hours) Could definitely go longer. - Does not hurt to remove. It's not completely painless but it's easy. Like a band-aid.Cons: - Leaves a slight sticky residue after removal - I was able to get 4 uses out of the roll. Again, I have D cups and each strip was long enough to cover about an  inch under my boob to around an inch over my shoulder. I used 2-3 strips per boob per use. Make sure you  order more than 1 if you plan on using often. - This isn't really a con but you have to be very careful when applying. The adhesive is very sticky and if you  peel the back of the tape too fast or don't apply slowly, the tape stretches so it will retract and expand,  sticking to itself.

  This tape is amazing!! I have a large bust and opt to wear a bra with everything. Needless to say; not wearing a bra was freeing. I advise a practice run before going out because the process is a little frustrating at first. I wore the tape in 100 degree Texas heat during an outside wedding and it didn‚Äôt budge. The removal process requires patients. I used baby oil. Stand in the bath tub and completely saturate the tape with the baby oil and let sit for about five minutes. When pulling the tape off, firmly hold your skin and gently pull the tape away from the skin. It‚Äôs a process but I think it‚Äôs worth it. Five stars for sure!!

  ¬†I literally have only used this rope maybe 6 times.  I got it only 10 days ago and it is already torn up. It is not durable at all and began to mess up on the 1st use. Also, the handles unscrew while jumping from time to time. I had to tighten them every time I used it. As you jump the handles somehow unscrew slowly. I am really disappointed cause I love how the rope feels when I jump with it. It is just cheaply made.It may work better for those who have the ability to jump rope in doors on a carpeted or hardwood floor.

  After my jump rope went bust with the ball bearings no longer spinning fast, I took a chance and ordered one from Amazon.  This has got to be the best jump rope I've ever used.  It's fast, inexpensive and easily adjustable.  If you're tall like myself at 6'4, this rope in my opinion is pretty much set for that height.  I would definitely recommend this jump rope.

  I actually bought this for my 7 year old daughter who has recently become a fanatic of jump rope. I love that the length is adjustable and the extra you can tuck inside the handle, so if anyone else at home wants to use it we can easily adjust the length. It is light weight and the handles are really amazing. Made to be soft and able to grip easily even if sweating.

  Really nice, very comfortable handles. A little difficult to adjust the length, but otherwise, a great jump rope. After a couple uses and the red has started to stretch a little, so I'm not certain how long these will last. For that price however, these earn its 5 stars.

  The handles are not as huge as the look on pictures, they are normal. The metal cable makes a huge difference for the durability it will last longer than the grip. It is easy to shorten the length, easy for beginners since I learned how to jump rope using this one but if it hits your leg it will sting (the only drawback of the metal cable).

  Wow. I just received this yesterday (last night to be exact) and put it on right away. I felt relief in my upper back/shoulder blades immediately. I personally didn‚Äôt think it changed my appearance until I walked by my husband wearing it under my hoodie, and he told me I looked different. ‚ÄúGood different‚Äù he clarified.The instructions say to start wearing it for a short amount of time and work up because it can be uncomfortable. I wore it the night I received it for an hour, and the discomfort I felt was mostly under my armpits, but it wasn‚Äôt unbearable and definitely worth that for the immediate change and pain relief.Background on me: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 130lbs, medium build. I‚Äôve had large breasts and bad posture since I was 14, which caused neck and upper back pain.  I was a year-round swimmer for years, so I have broad shoulders that are still kind of awkward to me even after years of not swimming competitively. I‚Äôve seen a chiropractor every week since high school for my neck and back pain, which helped but never fully alleviated the discomfort for long enough to skip a week.UPDATE! 1/3/21I had been wearing this brace almost every day since I received it, but now I am able to use it less and for less time. It‚Äôs more like a refresher when I feel like I need it.The first couple weeks after I received it, mychiropractor told me my neck wasn‚Äôt in dire need of an adjustment (as it has been, every week, for years). He actually asked me the same of the brace because of the difference it made in my posture and neck. My entire family couldn‚Äôt believe the difference (even my sisters across the country ON FACETIME)! They all asked for this for Christmas. So now my whole family has one!This product really worked (and is continuing to work) for me and now, my family. It can be uncomfortable (still is rough on my armpits), but after suffering so many years of excruciating neck pain and migraines, it‚Äôs worth it. I am amazed that after a couple decades of bad posture, this brace was able to help me so much in less than a month!

  ComfyBrace posture corrector really saved my sore back. After years of continuing on with the day to day comings and going‚Äôs in my life, posture naturally fell to the back of my mind. I hunched as I played with my children, I slouched as I folded laundry late at night, and bent down countless times to pick up toys and garbage from the floor. I was so busy taking care of all the things that seemed so important and my back silently came along for the ride. Until one day it didn‚Äôt. I woke up one morning and my entire upper back was burning, years or wear and tear began protesting. I was in so much pain, I couldn‚Äôt figure out what to do with myself. It was my grandson that suggested that maybe a posture corrector would be the solution. Thankfully amazon was able to deliver it the next day, and I immediately began wearing it. I can‚Äôt say magic happened over night, but I followed the instructions exactly, and the more I wore it, the more it became second nature for me. I still wear it for an hour each day when I do my yoga exercise, and I feel the difference the whole day.Now I am on top of my children, making sure they either wear a posture corrector or concentrate on their posture throughout the day. I don‚Äôt want them to suffer like I did.I will order a second corrector to wear while the other one is in the wash.It truly lives up to its name. It‚Äôs truly Comfy. The material is soft so it doesn‚Äôt hurt me, but it‚Äôs sturdy enough to maintain straight posture. It is adjustable so it can fit practically anyone, from my petite daughter, to my grandson who‚Äôs a basketball player. It looks like it‚Äôs pretty well constructed and can withstand quite a bit of regular wear and tear.I highly recommend this ComfyBrace posture corrector to people of all ages. Young ones take advantage before it‚Äôs too late, and the older fellows take advantage of the pain relief this will provide.

  I just got my brace yesterday and wore it for about half an hour, so that's where I'm coming from with this review.My family have noticed my poor posture lately and have been commenting on it, so I've ordered a new chair for my home office, a lumbar support cushion for my chair at work, and this thing for when I'm not at either.I've got a large torso and wide shoulders, so I wasn't sure how long the straps should be; eventually I decided to put them on with only slightly lengthened straps from the default. They're elastic, and fairly strongly so, and they held my shoulders back in the proper posture without trouble. My family noticed immediately that I was standing straighter, so clearly they're doing the job, and there wasn't any noticeable discomfort from the relatively tight straps.The seller recommends wearing them for short periods until you get used to them, and I can see why: I wore them only half an hour because my shoulders were getting sore.The fact of the muscle soreness suggests that my body is actually doing some of the work to hold my shoulders back (probably unconsciously), and that's good news: it means my rear deltoids will actually be tightening up over time while wearing them, improving my posture even without the brace on. I don't think this is the ideal solution for poor posture - barbell exercises for the chest and upper/lower back are the best solutions - but for anyone without time or access to a gym this is at lesat a reasonable alternative.I can't say how well this would help people with longterm injuries or chronic pain, as I don't have either, but at least as far as a single wearing this product seems to be exactly what its advertised to be. I'll update this review in a month or so, after I've worn it more.EDIT: I've now had the brace for two weeks, and I can safely say that its much more comfortable to wear for longer periods now than it was at the beginning. I've restarted my weightlifting regimen, so it's hard to say which has had more effect, but I've noticed myself automatically sitting up straight without having to consciously make myself do so. Obviously, this involves tensing muscles, so I have a little bit more soreness after long periods sitting with no back support than before, but that's been fading as I become accustomed to it.

  I am disabled with spine and joint problems and was looking for a low/no impact method to strengthen muscles. I ran across resistance bands and thought they looked like something that might work. I decided on this brand because they seemed to have the most basic features for the best price and had a good review rating. (I noticed when I went to write this review that the price has dropped several dollars!) This is my first and only experience with resistance bands, so I don't have any comparisons. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a set of instructions for different ways to use the bands, just a black and white page of drawings in different positions... however, I found tons online, so no big deal. It took a little getting used to, but once I got the weights (colors) and stances figured out I got exactly the kind of work-out that I have to have. My legs are getting a workout without harmful impact to my ankles, knees and hips. I was unpleasantly reminded how bad of shape I am in! I can only do about 10 reps right now, and I feel the muscle fatigue. Same thing with upper body, I have neck and shoulder problems, but with the bands I can customize the angles of stretching the bands so that I get a workout without neck strain. I'm sure I have a lot still to learn about stacking weights, etc., but I am still just a beginner. I'm starting to feel a little more energy and noticing some toning of my arms and legs. I'm glad I made the decision to try resistance bands. I wish they had used these while I was in physical therapy because they would have been perfect and I would have gotten used to the concept and versatility with a trainer instead of on my own.

  With gyms being closed and gym equipment getting resold for excessive amounts of money, I finally found a solution to staying active, safe, and healthy! I work 12 hour night shift and these exercise bands give me the opportunity to get some exercise in while I'm at work. The best part is that I'm able to work out a different muscle group every day. I honestly thought I wouldn't use these, but I've used them every night since getting them. The other best part is I don't need to lug around 5 different sets of dumbbells just to get 3 exercises done. It only takes about 15 seconds to add/remove/change the bands you're using. It‚Äôs so easy to install and the anti-slip handle makes working out even easier when you have a good sweat going! I definitely recommend this product to gain muscle and stay active.

  I'm a 8 handicap and was looking to buy some balls that I didn't mind playing when practicing and or when the drives are not going great.  I've used other cheap balls and other than around the green I can't tell much difference than the premium balls.  This one just lacks in all areas to me.And I'm not sure why it carries the ""distance"" logo.  I hit my normal ball at least 10-15 yards further than this hard ball plus it is pretty bad around the green.  It will stop with a lob wedge on soft greens like Bent, but on hard Bermuda greens, good luck.So for me, I definitely will not buy again even if cheap.  I bought two dozen and gave the last dozen away.
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade Distance Plus Golf Balls (One Dozen),$11.97,5,"
  First off, full disclosure--I'm not an experienced golfer, by most standards.  I've been playing for less than a decade.  As such, I can't say how many flaws there are in this ball's performance, because there's enough in my own game to make it impossible to know when a bad shot might be due to an inferior ball.  That said...I lose golf balls.  A LOT.  So it's not worth it to me to pay the premium price for the top-of-the-line balls out on the market, even when I can find them on sale.  So price was a major factor in my decision to buy these in the first place.  The other was the color...I'm slightly colorblind, so I lose white golf balls FAR too often...they get out about 150 yards or so and I just can't see them anymore, most of the time.There are cheaper balls on the market.  I know, I've tried them.  I like the feel of these better...I feel like I get better response off the club and better ball flight out of these than anything else I've tried in this end of the market (after playing these, the other, cheaper golf balls that I used to play with feel like I'm hitting wooden balls or small rocks by comparison).  And the color is immensely helpful to me in my game...these are not just yellow balls, this shade of yellow stands out more than most for me and makes it a lot easier for me to track my shots and find my ball.  I get comparable results from these that people I've golfed with are getting from upscale, premium-priced balls, so I'm really pleased with them, overall.My only complaint is, they aren't very durable.  Pretty much any time I end up in the sand with one of them, that ball has a permanent scuff from the shot to get back out (the one place where the cheaper balls I've played with hold up better).  But I typically wind up losing a scuffed ball a few shots later, anyway, so it's not like that scuff mark gets a lasting chance to mess up my game.I don't see myself changing to a new brand anytime soon.  Golf is already an expensive game.  Finding affordable, reliable golf balls helps a lot to keep it viable as a pastime.

  For the price point this is one of the best balls I have played. It's not a solid rock like Top Flite and other comparable  balls in this very low price range. Moderate spin and control around the greens with wedges. However it is a little lack luster when it comes to it's durability. Although if your looking at this price point durability generally isn't your concern.I would recommend this ball to anyone who is graduating from using batches of used balls and is looking for a more consistent feel to start lowering their scores further. However if your a ball snob lets be honest here, stop comparing  a 15$ value pack of balls to your 50$ pro V1's and giving them a 1 star review. These balls are great for the $$$$

  So, I head down to the park almost every day with my Labrador and hit golf balls.  I usually take an ""A"" wedge, good for about 90 yards for me.  I decided to take one of these new balls with me, and grabbed about 8 other balls and headed on out.  I hit the eight balls.  Typical distance.  I thought, well I don't think I'm going to lose it, and I dropped this one on the turf.  As soon as I hit it I'm like What? It just flew further.  About 5 yards.  I thought well this is an anomaly, and I did it again, same result.  This ball was further by about 4 yards.  I thought, well, let me do this one more time, and try to hit my other balls harder.  This time this ball about about 10 yards further, into the woods.  I had to go back with a ball retriever to get it, because my Labrador was right next to it and wouldn't get it.  Anyway, long ball.  I can't speak to how it is around the green.  I *suspect* it will be a little too hard. But not sure.  Anyway, for the price, and the distance, this is a no brainer.  Have fun.

I used this at least 3 times a week for ~30 minutes each time, never to crazy or intense. Well today, 10 months later, it unexpectedly broke while using it causing me and the machine to almost fall over. I am well under the max weight of 250 lbs, always kept a steady pace, and followed the directions provided with it. I'm relatively disappointed because I really enjoyed this and was able to lose some weight and build some muscle, but I expected it to last longer than it did.

  This stepper was pretty easy to put together and doesn't take up a lot of space. I lived in a 1-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and we had the stepper in there for about a year, and it fit perfectly. I have noticed that only after a few months or so, the stepper started to squeak when my girlfriend or I would use it. It didn't bother us a whole lot so it still squeaks, but I imagine a bit of lubricant would fix the squeaking, so I would recommend getting some if a squeaky stepper would bother you. I have also noticed that the handle bars can move around a bit when you are using it, too, but they don't seem to be in any danger of falling off or breaking. Otherwise, this is a great way to get some more exercise in the comfort of your own home, while not sacrificing a lot of space. I highly recommend this stepper, especially for the price.Update July 7, 2019: Well, the stepper broke today. :( I have attached pictures of the damage. It was doing fine and I didn't realize there was a problem until the stepper pads gave out as I was using it today. There is a tension cord that connects the two stepper pads and lets them go up and down opposite of each other as you step, and the left side of this cord seems to have rusted through and broken, and now the air pumps under each stepper pad will still hold them up if I lift them up with my hands, but when I step on them they both just deflate and do not go back and forth in a stepping fashion. I checked the order date, and I ordered it on February 22, 2017, so it would have come two days later (I have Amazon Prime) and I remember setting it up not long after it arrived. The latest I would have had it set up and started using it, then, is March 1, 2017, so it hasn't even been 2.5 years and it broke. :( Most of it still seems good except for the cord, so I will see if I can find a replacement cord or fix it somehow. I will update this review if I can find a fix for it, otherwise I am currently detracting two stars. This is a great little stepper if it is going to last years and years, but if I am going to have to be spending $50 on a replacement stepper every 2-3 years, it is not so great and I would probably recommend saving money and either just finding a set of stairs near you to use, or purchasing a small step-stool and using that as a ""stepper"". After today, I can unfortunately no longer recommend this as enthusiastically, and would recommend looking for a cheaper, less complicated alternative, like a step-stool, if this is unable to be fixed. I will update this review if I find anything, otherwise you can assume I was unable to fix this and my recommendation to find an alternative holds.

  Stepper worked great for a month and the welding snapped right off. I contacted Sunny Health through email and they kept giving me a run around.  Asked me to send picture so I did. They said they cannot open the picture files. The pictures were taken with my phone and they are normal jpeg files. I took more pictures with same phone and sent them again. This time they said they cannot see where the break was on the pictures. I took 20 more pictures from all different angles and resent them.  About 3 weeks after I initiated this process they finally said they will send thereplace parts.  This was 4 months ago and I have not received any parts.... I highly recommend buying a different company's product than Sunny Health & Fitness.  Bad product and worse customer service.....

  I purchased this at the beginning of January 2017, and today it broke (May2017). The tension cord snapped. I'm 5'7"", 150lbs, so not likely due to my weight.Also when you raise tension,  The calorie counter does not take that into account. Additionally there's no way to enter your weight and have a calculate it thoroughly. I would say it's just a random guess.

  We wanted a stair-stepper, but didn't have space for a standard one. This solved the problem.  We tuck it in a corner that measures 20 x 20 inches and bring it out when we're ready to use it... it's that easy to move!  It may seem a little ""tippy"" due to its light weight, but that goes away as soon as you put your weight on it. It's really remarkably designed and well constructed. It will have you breathing hard in a few minutes, and the resistance can be adjusted to increase your level of exertion. Due to its small size, it may not be perfect for a large man. But if you're average sized and need a stepper but don't have space for a big one - this is a great quality product for a reasonable price.

  I am a 65yo woman and bought this to strengthen my legs and knees.  I love it!  It is small and compact enough to stand in my bedroom.  It was easy for me to assemble, had it up and running in about 15 minutes.  I use it several times per day and even on the weakest setting is challenging but I expect to be able to increase the tension soon.  I highly recommend it!

  My husband put this together for me.  He said it was pretty easy. Did not take long.  Must say step is short if you do not want to keep hitting the metal bar on bottom.  Do not like how it feels to hit the bottom.  So I try to avoid it and thinking it would be easy, no way.  Its a workout. Hubby told me to start out slow.  Not to go to fast at first.  So I watch TV , go a slower pace and really feel it in my calves.  Even loosing the tension, it is not easy, but do I really want it too easy.  I want to loose weight and watch my shows and exercise.  I would buy it again.

  I suffered for many years from a severe case of carpel tunnel syndrome.  It probably all began because I work for a commercial designing company, and I spend about 8-10 hours a day doing 3D rendering on the computer, which entails a lot of using the keypad and mouse. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with tingling in my hands and sometimes with severe pain. I spent many restless nights twisting and turning in bed.I was advised by my Dr. to try wearing a night brace, and desperate to find a solution to the endless pain I stopped into my local pharmacy to pick up a handbrace from a big brand. I wore it for a few weeks and didn't see any difference, the pain at night was still severe and sleeping at night was almost a thing of the past. Nothing was working until I bought this comfybrace.After using this brace for one night I realized this was really making a big difference. I right away saw major improvement. After months of not being able to sleep at night I started getting a couple of hours of shut eye in a row!! This was a major breakthrough for me. Now that i'm wearing it for two weeks, night pain is a thing of the past. I thought surgery was my only solution, but maybe this is an easier solution!!!This comfybrace is made of durable material which makes it very soft yet sturdy and therefore my hands weren't sweaty from it. Another thing which was very important to me was the super soft and comfortable cushioning beads by the palm. The beads are soft enough that they got molded to the shape of my hand and hold my hand perfectly in that position.My hands are pretty average size for a man, and this glove fits me perfectly!! This brace is really adjustable so it would probably fit most hand sizes, including pretty slim hands and husky ones too.This brace is also made of very high quality materials and is stitched together very strongly. I can see that this will really last me a while. You can also see the picture I have attached showing the high quality stitching.I highly recommend this brace, and it's definitely worth the money. It's not worth  wasting nights when there is such an easy and affordable solution available.Thank you so much Comfy Brace!!!

  I am an RN and have severe issues with carpel tunnel for a very long time that wakes me up frequently from sleep and causes pain when trying to lift or crochet. In fact many nights, the pain is unbearable with numbness in my fingers and stabbing burning elbow and wrist pain. I have tried many braces before and while some have helped, most have been too uncomfortable to wear at night so I have not been consistent in using them. I was hesitant to buy another one, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give this one a try. The first time I put it on I knew it was different with the padding and overall comfort. One of my biggest issues was most other braces felt very warm and making my arm feel clammy and hot, and being from South Texas, I don't want anything making me feel warmer than we already are. I slept all night that first night and most other nights since using it. While I know a brace wont eliminate the problem completely, I recommend this brace for anyone dealing with this painful and annoying issue especially during flare ups of the condition and symptoms. I am getting another just to have for travel as I am very impressed with this product. Whoever created this must have had the issue of carpal tunnel and been frustrated with the current braces on the market and fixed them!! Bravo to you!!

  In the past year or so, I've started twisting one hand and wrist under my head as I sleep, which results in hand swelling and pain when I wake up. My doctor suggested wearing a brace to discourage me from twisting my wrist as I sleep.Well! Easier said than done! I tried two or three braces before this one. One was okay to wear but barely provided any support and did not prevent the twist. Another gave firmer support but was so uncomfortable that I removed in in my sleep (yeah, lifelong sleepwalker here).So then I tried the Comfy Brace. I was a little dubious since it does not come in a right or left hand version, the brace will fit either hand which I thought might mean it would not fit well. I was sooo wrong.Wowza, it works a charm! The three straps provide a more customisable fit so it can be firm enough to discourage the twist but still comfortable enough that I leave it on in my sleep. The cushion full of beads is brilliant--I put it on, wiggle my fingers once or twice, the beads shift into position and I honestly can't feel the metal support (part of the problem with the uncomfortable brace was that the end of the metal support tended to dig into my palm).It has definitely helped my wrist and hand without being uncomfortable at all. It fits like it was made specifically for my hand. Either hand! I've only used it for a couple months, so I don't know yet how it will last (still feels like new). If I ever wear it out, I'll buy another. No more experimenting, this is definitely the perfect design for me.

  I went on a cruise in December and used the fanny pack on the ship as well as the excursions.  I use my phone when on deck to take pictures and if I wanted my hands free, the phone fit well in the fanny pack.  On the excursions I had room for passport, money, 2 credit cards, Chapstick and phone (room to spare).  The pack did repel water but it also survived an accidental dunking.  Things got wet but I was able to dry everything.  Grateful passport was in waterproof sleeve.  Friend had my phone to take picture.  Sneaky wave got me...LOL

  I have suffered with cystic hormonal acne on and off for years. My first wave of acne was when I went through puberty. It randomly went away only to reappear when I turned 20. Now at 24, it‚Äôs calmed down somewhat but I still get breakouts & these bandages are life savers. They have a gel like feel that acts as a scab to promote healing. I wash my face at bedtime. I don‚Äôt put any lotions or serums on after my face is washed because I feel the bandages work better with a bare face. Then, I put them where my breakouts are. They are not uncomfortable, and I don‚Äôt feel them so I can wear them all night. As you can see, the two white dots are where my breakouts were & these bandages literally pulled out all that gross gunk. When I take them off in the morning, my breakouts appear smaller and they heal quicker. People have talked about how they hurt to peel off. I just grab a towel and wet it with warm water and soak them until they peel off gently. Highly recommend for anyone. They are also great for cuts, burns, etc. Happy healing Ì†ΩÌ∏ä

  These are great! I use them most often on my elderly mother. Stays on securely for days or even weeks if appropriate.  Nice environment for wound to heal.  Have used over mosquito bites that I have scratched too much! Keeps my hands off and the itching soothed. This small size is not as good for sores on feet because it gets pushed around from friction.  The larger size stays in place.

  These were great, at first... stuck on nicely, did not peel up at all at the edges when in water, and I was using them for a burn that felt much better and protected under the bandage. Then, about 12 hours in, I started to get itchy around the bandage edges. Then swelling. Little hard bumps. It's been 24 hours since I peeled off the bandage and it is less red and itchy, but still not better -- another day perhaps. What a huge disappointment. I needed these, and now I have no bandages to use.

  The kayak was a Christmas gift for my 3 boys. We live in Ohio on an 8 acre pond. I blew up the kayak in May since the weather is nice. There is a large hole in the bottom of the kayak right next to the seam. Because of the location of the hole it is impossible to patch. I contacted Intex and they refuse to accept a return and replace the kayak. The warranty is only for 90 days. Do not purchase this kayak. It's worthless junk.

  This kayak was great the first five times we used it. The sixth time, as we were inflating it, it began hissing and a small hole appeared in one of the seams in the top of the floor. It was a huge bummer because we had driven from Washington DC to Lake Powell in Utah to kayak, and this happened the first time we took it out to go on the water. : (

  I bought this for me and my family to use on a camping trip, easier to haul than a plastic kayak. My expectation was low, I have bad luck with inflatable rafts and such. I had the attitude that if it lasted the 5 day trip and kids enjoyed it I would get my money worth.  This is so worth the $94!  I had 4 kids in it most of the week, the were jumping out in middle of the lake and swimming.  The kids range up to 16 years old and say it‚Äôs very easy to get in and out of.  As a matter of fact the 4 tried to tip it in middle of the lake by leaning one way and they were not successful!  It turns on a dime, the skeg is impressive for an inexpensive inflatable boat, I did not attach mine like some suggested and had kids dragging it in and out of the water with no problem.  Paddles are a bit short for an adult but it‚Äôs easier for an adult to paddle with a short paddle than a child to use a long paddle so they (intex) did well considering.  Personally I think the seats are a little low but I sat on my lifejacket and that made me feel better!  For inflatable seats they are comfortable and supportive, if you sit on something for height the backrest is too low too really lean on but I tend to sit up when I paddle. When I was out in middle of lake I easily turned around and sat on the floor and leaned against the front and put the backrest to my seat down and stretched my legs out so I could face my other half and chat while enjoying a cold drink‚Ä¶.it was great!

  For under 100 dollars this kayak was a great purchase and highly recommended. Unfortunately, after about 5/6 uses a small air hole has appeared in the top of the bottom section at one of the seems. I have read reviews that it comes with a repair kit, but did not receive one and have reached out to Intex to see if they will send me one (will update if they do). You get what you pay for, so as long as your repaired to patch some tiny holes (size of like a needle) here and there this is worth the 90 dollars, but I would not recommend paying hundreds of dollars for this product due to how common this appears to happen based on other reviews.Overall, its easy to inflate and fits two full size adults (I am 6' 2"" 190 pounds). Its also pretty comfortable for what you pay.  Takes about 10-15 minutes to inflate and would suggest inflating near the water as its a lot easier to carry in a bag. My only other suggestion would be to send it in a better bag.. the bag completely ripped apart the first time using it and could not have been made any cheaper. If you buy this invest in a bag to carry it.

  The adjoining vinyl top seam on each side can scrap your hands frequently when you roll.  I was concern that I may get cuts like those you get from papers, but they only irritate so far after three rides instead of causing real cuts.  I like the stable ride the kayak provides and the safety of three main air chambers.  I feel pretty safe and secure.  Initially, I thought the oars are too short as the kayak is pretty wide in the middle section where the rear passenger paddles.  After some adjustments to my strokes, they seem to work adequately well.

  My wife and I plan on taking this to Florida this winter and wanted to test it out before we took it with us. We have ocean going kayaks, but they are heavy and must be carted on the roof so we were considering taking this kayak instead. We were expecting it to be difficult to inflate, but the little hand pump worked quickly and efficiently. We expected the paddles to be cheap and shabby but they were sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble. We took it out into a lake and had a great time. It was comfortable and sturdy enough to make us feel safe in aligator territory .

  First, the seats placed me so low, I had to buy additional cushions so I could paddle without rubbing my arms on the sides.Second, it got a pinhole on a seam, after the second use. We were very careful with use, transportation, and storage, so I believe it was a manufacturing flaw. I was able to patch it, though.Third, on the fifth time using it, it got a large, unrepairable gash on the bottom.This thing was WAY more trouble than it‚Äôs worth, and far too fragile. We only used it on the intracoastal waterway, at high tide, and babied it. Nothing rough at all.

  I love this brush. I can use it for the scrubbing of anything honestly, but I prefer to save it for bottles, pitchers, large bowls, etc. I use glass water bottles, they have a very small neck and I know that the dishwasher does not clean them properly . This brush gets into the bottle and makes it sparkle inside and out. I have a pitcher that is square with a small neck too, plus a handle that the liquid fills up. It was like a rubiks cube trying to clean it out, with this brush everything changed. The handle bends just enough I can get into the corners of the pitcher, into the handle area, and most importantly under the handle. Best day ever cleaning my various liquid holders properly.  I am VERY vigorous, and I have super strong arms , so if this brush has held up for a year for me it will hold up for anyone.

  If I could give it 6 stars I would!  Coming from my wife who wanted a new bottle brush, this is huge!  Many of you who have read my reviews know that we have 4 special needs children in our home.  My wife constantly is looking for things she can make all natural with few ingredients and fresh ingredients.  This involves a lot of cooking for her while I am at work.  With a lot of cooking, comes a lot of cleaning.  She makes her own organic almond milk that she puts in a glass bottle to store in the fridge.  well in 2 to 3 days when it is empty, it has a nasty film on the inside.  It has been very challenging to get this film off the bottle and have the bottle cleaned and ready for the next batch to go in.  I know the challenge as I frequently assist with cleanup.  We never could get it completely clean  UNTIL NOW.  this OXO bottle brush is stiff enough yet soft enough, and it lets you reach the bottom of the bottle no problem.  the Grip on the handle is very good on my wife's often sore hands.  The handle end has a hole thru it so we were able to use an S hook we had laying around to hand it up to store and for sanitary drying purposes.  We will be using this a lot and are so very pleased with the product.  Fair price, product as described BETTER then described. We have solved our dirty bottle problem and anticipate this brush to last a very long time.  Great product!

  I have small feet, size 5-6 depending on shoe width. The get the brace tight enough, it gapes around the heel hole on the sides, so the foot can't get in or out of a shoe. It is also thick enough on the bottom that it bothers my arch and makes that foot slightly higher, so it's uncomfortable to walk in even without a shoe. For a person with small feet to wear this in a shoe, the material would have to be less thick, and the wraps shorter (they wrap around and around my foot).That said, I bought this brace to wear when I sleep because for some reason I pronate one foot during the night and wake up with ankle pain. The brace works just fine for sleeping purposes, eliminating morning ankle pain so I'll keep it. The company needs a scaled down version of this for customers with small feet who want to walk while wearing it.

  Good product and I do appreciate the support it gives AFTER I finish up the at the gym. It certainly reduces my ankle pain after running and working out, but the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because it will not fit into my shoe so I can workout with it on. For reference, I am a 6 in women's.In light of this however, the company reached out to me and while also letting me know they are working on a brace to fit smaller feet, they also wanted to let me try another product since the ankle brace didn't work out for me. I gave them a 5 star afterward for their excellent customer service, and will be sure to leave nice feedback for the calf braces I will be receiving as the complimentary product. I certainly would recommend giving Bodyprox a try.

  The Velcro secures well and it's easy to wrap around your foot, especially if you have pain or can't flex your foot into a sock. We used it for getting around with a cane throughout the day after a minor foot sprain and less frequently as support in a low impact exercise class. It was worn about 8 to 10 hours per day the first week. The heel opening began to ravel and wear after about 2 weeks of pretty frequent use. We ordered the large and it barely fits a women's 8.5. Order up a couple sizes.

  Even though I measured around my ankle the way the description told me, it does not fit around my ankle.  Bodyprox stands behind their products, though, so just be sure you measure carefully and then work with them if it doesn't measure up.  I am VERY PLEASED with their customer service.

  I would include a pic but I'm at work LOL. Okay so I've worked for plastic surgeons I've seen so many fajas (waist trainers) in my day i cant even tell you how many. This is by far the best, why? Because it legit makes you SWEAT without even working out because of the material its made of. I am  wearing it at work under my clothes for the sweat properties. All bodies are created differently, so to tell you my height and weight MIGHT help you but we all hold weight in different places and my torso is super long-because of that I got a large because i wanted to be able for it to cover all the way down to my lower belly  and it DOES, i will prob get a medium next because its a bit on the larger side but overall I'm super happy, and i plan on seriously losing weight with this. I haven't even tried the sweat gel that comes with it yet because i don't even need it. For the record i am my highest weight ive ever been at 177 and 5'5 soooooo i got a large but i know if you realllyy wanted it to be super tight you can get away w a medium, it just might not cover your lower belly if your torso is long like mine. Great buy!!!

  ¬†So I‚Äôve been using the sweet sweat band WITH and WITHOUT the sweet sweat cream thing 5 days a week for 2 weeks.One: the cream (IMO) is not necessary. You sweat just the same.Two: YOU DEFINITELY SWEAT!Three: after a lot of use (I wore it twice a day for about half an hour each time) it started to roll down.It would‚Äôve gotten a 5 if it weren‚Äôt for the rolling down after only a couple weeksDisclaimer: I lost inches and weight not with JUST the band....I changed my eating habits and exercised 2 times a day.

  First I‚Äôll start off buy saying it worked and made me sweat more but after about two weeks, it gave me a horrible rash that spread from my stomach and back to my neck and arms also.please be carful when purchasing this item. Some others also said it happened to them too. Read the other reviews.

  I ordered it to help flatten out my tummy, I put it on to get the feel just around the house, and I started to notice I had better posture and I could feel my hips, ribs, and back align. At first it was a bit uncomfortable, but I am very large breasted and have horrible posture. Once I took it off I felt heavier. Meaning I began putting it on more because it made me feel better. I noticed my breathing even felt easier. I haven't used it yet for the sweat part,  but I would buy simply for the support part of it, and I bought it for tummy fat not having support being anything I would use from it.Now, when it came to size... I read the reviews looked at pics. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 160 pounds, short and built. A lot of the reviews said to order small. There were many body type 5‚Äô6 188 pounds tall and built, so I assumed I definitely needed a small. I wish I had gotten a medium, simply so I personally can cover more ground with it. I want to be able to wrap from under my bra down to my hips. Also, going a size up wouldn‚Äôt hurt simply because you can tie it how tight you want it.  The Velcro‚Äôs is extremely durable and it‚Äôs easy to put on and take off. I highly recommend this product, I would be writing my review on the weigh loss result, but I would order it for support purposes now. I didn‚Äôt realize how off my spine was until I got this. Other things become easier when you can breath and you‚Äôre body is positioned properly. Good luck!

  Love using this. It fits well and it doesn‚Äôt slide down. It stays on until I take it off. I sweat a lot while wearing it and I use the sweet sweat roll on application with it. Also it doesn‚Äôt take long for it to dry. Super plus it comes with a small net bag that you could roll it up and place it in. I recommend once you get home to hang it up to fully dry though so it doesn‚Äôt get super smelly

  I stumbled upon this waist trainer after seeing the sweat my sister would have after her work outs! Before placing my order I wasn‚Äôt sure what size to get so I took a look at the reviews & questions. I then saw someone asking what size do they recommend for a person who is 5‚Äô2 and about 200lbs, literally my description (don‚Äôt judge :( I‚Äôm working on it). Anyways I saw that they recommended getting an XL, so I immediately placed my order! Here are a few pics of the packaging and what is included. When you first see it out, you might think it might be too big for you but once you like actually put it on properly, it fits great! 10/10 def recommend!

  So I didn't follow the size guide which is my fault. If I had it probably would work a little better. HOWEVER, this is still an amazing waist trimmer. It is very durable and I use the sweet sweat stick along with it. Bother together certainly make me sweat. I tried using the waist trimmer from Walmart it wasn't long enough. I finally got so annoyed I decided to spend the money and get this one. After using it, my results are so much better and I am not annoyed through my entire workout. I would definitely recommend that someone buy this instead of the cheap ones. I am a very big girl so I thought I would get a bigger size. Turns out I should have just followed the size guide. So I will be buying a size smaller :) I also love how the velcro is smaller so it doesn't scratch you.

  I got this bottle when I was planning to do a summit attempt to Mount Rainer. I already had one which I sparingly used, but for this trip I needed 2 32oz ones. So I got this additional one. For purpose of mountaineering I need following:-- Large mouth so that even if it freezes a little , it still allows you to drink from it. Also easier to clean.- Use for keeping warm inside the sleeping bag after filling with hot water.- BPA free for obvious.- No leak since I need to put this inside my backpack.Overall it met all the criteria's below. At summit, 50% of the water was frozen but I was still able to use it without any issues. These bottle are durable, I even kept these in my check in backpack while taking the flight. No issues what so ever. The marking can be useful if you want to break it down. We took 5 breaks from camp Muir to summit and I was able to manage the intake considering 64 oz and tried to drink the appropriate amount using the markings. Also I did not feel any difference in taste keeping the water for longer duration. I will report back if I observe any more features or faults with this.**If you find my review useful then please click the 'Yes' in helpful.

  I've used my wide mouthed Nalgene for EIGHT years, every day at every job I've had. We were inseparable. All the lunches we had together, the late nights, early mornings, fears of bosses, laughing at co-workers...ah the joys we had together. I didn't even treat it that well, dropping it on concrete, down stairs, throwing it in my car, and not a single leak. One time I threw it in my car without the lid on all the way, and it reminded me gently with spilled water that I needed to tighten the lid. I've left it behind almost everywhere, but we always found each other. Until one work meeting, left it in the conference room. I'm guessing someone grew quite jealous of our affection, and swiped it! NOO! Truly an end of an era. There really was a connection here. Well 8 years of daily use later is a good enough review for me to come back and buy the same water bottle. :)

  The main reason I bought this was because I really like things that glow in the dark. I also wanted to drink more home filtered water instead of having to buy bottled water all the time. So this glow in the dark Nalgene water bottle helps me save money and saves the environment at the same time.I included a couple of pictures for more details. I used a regular sized Funko Pop for size comparison. Right before taking the picture showing the glow in the dark effect, I charged both objects using my 100 LED uv flashlight.

  I'll start off by saying that I've been using my Nalgene bottle daily for about 3 months. I've only put water in this bottle, and I only handwash it. I'm too much of a fan of the oz/mL label to throw it in the dishwasher. I imagine it would come off easily, and I like to see how much I'm actually drinking throughout the day.I've dropped this bad boy on concrete a few times, so yeah he'll get some scratches easy-peasy. But no cracks thus far, nor have there been any leaks. Also, the wide mouth is nice for when I want to put ice in my water.The major thing about this bottle is the cap attachement. I like how the plastic cap is attached to another piece of plastic which wraps around the ""neck"" of the bottle to keep the cap from rolling away, but that loop is definitely NOT a place to hold it from. I used to hang on to the loop while doing my daily activities, but I noticed it was becoming loose. Since then I've stopped, and everything has stayed in shape. I know other people got to the point of that breaking off.Other than that, I really like this bottle for the price. It's big enough to where I don't need to be refilling it constantly, but also at the right size to fit in my bag when I'm on the go. Its mere presence works wonders of reminding me to drink water since the blue color I got somehow makes water look... appetizing?ANYWAY... My suggestion to you, potential buyer of this particular Nalgene bottle, is to prepare yourself to transport this BPA free container by the body and handwash it as much as your annoyance of germs goes. But most importantly, stay hydrated.

  If you already have Nalgene, you know what you're getting.If you do NOT own a Nalgene, boy are you in for a treat. They're the best bottles. Once you use a wide mouth bottle, there's no going back. These are seriously tough bottles. For example, you can:1. Drive over them (big Suburban). Still held water.2. Drop them off of a 15 story building. Shhh probably not real legal.3. Store acid in them. Eh. Don't ask. NOT pee. Also not the drug. Chemistry, people.4. They can hold pee too, though....again don't ask.In addition, Nalgene bottles have a magical ability to cause stickers to adhere like a bug on a windshield at 80 miles an hour on a hot summer day.Go buy one.

  These are probably the best assortment of band-aids I ever purchased.  There is a variety of types, as well as a variety of sizes within each type.  I think the only box that is all one size is the 60 basic medium size bandages.The assortment includes sheer strips, water-proof, heavy duty, and everything from small rounds to larger bandages (for knee size scrapes).  Many of the bandages are also four side adhesive, so it grips on all four sides, rather than just two and buckling up when you bend a finger or arm.There are just 20 of the small dots, so this is NOT a 300 pack where 200 of the bandages are tiny.  It also has 30 treated (anti-bacterial) bandages.Absolutely going to purchase these again.

  ¬†I got these because of the wide variety, different shapes, sizes and every type bandaid for anything imagined was all in this box. This is a brand you can trust already but the price for 300 mixed varieties and kinds was what got me to buy this over just a litte 30 count box. Great savings for quality products.

  A variety box of 300 bandages with several different styles and purposes.  How hard would it have been to give each style its own clearly labeled wrapper?  I went to stock my medicine cabinets and first aid kits and found that all six styles have exact same green wrapper - duh!

  Gave it a 4 star review just because it leaves this ‚Äústicky goo‚Äù when I peel off the bandaid; other than that, it‚Äôs a really good variety of different types and sizes of bandaids for the price.I get cuts here and there at work, have a firstaid kit at work but all of the stuff they have in there are probably 30+ yrs old, so I decided to buy this to bring to work.Had two little cuts today so I decided to use the little round ones to stop the bleeding so I can keep working without worrying about leaving blood trails. Took them off to wash my hand, and found out it was a bit hard to peel off also it leaves this sticky residue on my skin and nail. (Which was a little hard to get off).But overall, can‚Äôt really complaint too much when it‚Äôs was pretty cheap for 300 of them in different types and sizes.

  All the boxes come color-coded for which type is inside, but every single bandaid is covered in the SAME GREEN LOGO. Sure, the shapes are different, but why not label which kind is inside?!?!? Now I have a box of assorted bandaids, but I have to guess whether I'm picking sheer or fabric or whatever.... It's such a pain and I wouldn't have ordered this variety pack, if I had known I'd have to choose blindly.

  I was irritated to say the least when this arrived in a Curad box as pictured that is much bigger than it needs to be, because it contains six or seven other boxes inside. I keep all my bandages in a container. When I went to put them into it, I realized the wrapper says nothing about the type of bandage inside. What's the use of having this huge variety if I can't tell before I choose if I am getting sheer, or plastic, or cloth, or antibacterial. So now I have a medicine cabinet full of boxes that take up far more space than needed. Back to Bandaid brand next time.

  I purchased this in August of 2015 and it has served its purpose well.  Assembly was easy.  If I remember correctly, it took me less than 30 minutes.  I don‚Äôt use it for anything else other than pull ups and chin-ups, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be good for pushups and sit-ups.  I question how effective dips would be on this since it seems a bit too low to do a full movement dip.  It has handled my weight (145 lbs) well and has not started to bend or sag.  I do have a couple of complaints, the padding on the bar where it meets the door frame should be thicker.  Mine degraded without me noticing and the actual solid bar started to push against my doorframe.  Now my doorframe is damaged.  I recommend putting a sock between the doorframe and the bar to provide more padding for protection.  My other complaint is that the flat piece that goes against the wall above the doorframe could discolor your wall.  It did mine.  I recommend putting something in between the wall and the flat plastic part to prevent against this.  Other than that, this is a well built product that performs as advertised.

  It doesn't fit every door and it won't work for me.  The molding above my doors is 1"" thick/4.25"" and that's too high--it appears this product was designed for smaller molding.  The top horizontal bar must rest *on top of the molding*; otherwise, it won't stay up when you're pulling up on it (while a lot of your weight will be redirected into the door frame, there's still a downward vector which the molding above the door absorbs).The photo demonstrates how the unit hangs, and I'm about 0.25"" shy of fitting.  Sigh.Also, this product probably won't work on anything other than flat molding: the top bar is only 0.75"" and probably doesn't provide enough offset for decorative moldings, which would probably get crushed.These size limitations aren't on Amazon's web site or in the manual, which I read before unpacked the product; this is clearly a vendor miss.  Other products from this vendor note a molding size restriction of 3.5"".Update: vendor contacted me and offered a completely satisfactory solution, so I'm boosting my rating.  Customer service matters!

  Terrible terrible materials for putting the product together. The product itself may be FANTASTIC, but if you can't even properly complete the assembly process, then it's useless. What should be the easiest assembly has wrong parts for doing so. As a result of NOT being able to properly tighten the bolts provide. The wall protecting plastic bar is made of poor material in which the bolts easily stripped the plastic when trying to even loosely tighten it. On top of that, there's no way of reversing the bolt tightening process (I was going to switch out the bolts for personal ones that contain a screwdriver access head so that you can hold the bolt in place on one end while tightening on the other...the ones provided don't allow for that) , but as a result of not having that, I can't switch out the bolt. This leaves me with a loose dangling arm, which basically means that I can't use the product. Not sure of anyone had this same experience, but I would suggest that Iron Gym switch out some of its assembly parts for more logical and sturdy materials.  Unfortunate bc I was looking forward to using this, and now I can't even return this product for a refund.

  Grips have come unattached to the frame after only 1.5 months, making product basically unusable in pull-up position.

  The device is GREAT for the first 30 days.. Which coincidently is also your 30 day money back period...  BUT after 30 days, AliveCor will cripple your device unless you pay $10 per month extortion fee..You are not allowed to save any EKG's to your OWN personal device.. you can only view the last one, provided you didint close it.. Once you exit out of the EKG, its gone forever... NO ability to save histor√±y!!!in order to save ANY EKG's on your device you must pay AliveCor $10 per month..This is a sham!  you pay $100 for a device AND you must pay $10 per month to use it..  They even block taking a screen shot of the EKG!!!  Total sham..Its like saying you can only view the last picture you took with your phone, but if you want to save any pictures to your own devices that you took with that device, you need to pay Google or Apple $10 per month to save photos on your phone..  Ridiculous!!-EDIT-  I wanted to edit my review and provide some good alternative product recommendations.  I have been using the ""SonoHealth"" EKG monitor for a few months now and I find this a  MUCH superior product to the Kardia..SonoHealth EKG Monitor is a standalone device that does not require a phone to record EKG's and provides immediate results on the own screen.. It features a rechargeable battery and color screen..SonoHealth app also allows you store infinite amount of EKG recordings WITHOUT any subscription!!  It also support MANY more diagnostic capabilities..In short - I would NOT recommend Kardia due its shortcomings and would instead recommend an alternative product like SonoHealth!

  The real issue is that when you download the app you have to agree to let them send you ads on their products and you have to let third parties send additional as well as allow them put put cookies on your device. They say you can opt out at any time but what they don't tell you is that you have to go to each third party individually to opt out and some do not have an opt out feature, sound transparent? They let you do one click to accept their terms and it takes hours to undo and even then it cannot be completely undone.Now for the device. It seems to work ok but, if you happen to be one who has a low resting heart rate, below 50, then each time you record your EKG you get an unclassified and they suggest you send it to them or your physician for evaluation, at a cost of course. They seem to sell this device to give third parties a right to collect your data, to sell you their products and to sell you their subscription so you can store and compare your data which seems like that is a part of the reason you buy the product. $120 a year seems like a steep price for such a simple process. Would not recommend this device.

  I bought Kardia Mobile, and by the time, I opened the box, the Return Product time had expired. And the product never worked from get go. I though it might have been the battery that came with the Unit, so I bought a new battery - that didn't work either. Now I am left with a Product that doesn't work, cannot return it (Since the return time expired). And when I go to Amazon site to get hold of the vendor, I seem to go round and round, not able to find, to whom I should report my problem,Once I realized I had a problem with the product,  I read the reviews written by other users, only to find out they had also realized that it has limited practical use as they have to keep paying monthly to have the historical data preserved.  The disclosure from the manufacturer is not too transparent, about having to pay $10 per month to have the data retained, unless I totally missed the fine print about it. As suggested by the manufacturer, I replaced the battery only to find out that that didn‚Äôt help.

  This product seemed like a great instrument to add to my cardiac healthcare. However, all the documentation I have read, both on Amazon and on the company's website, does NOT tell you once you install the application on your phone, that a Cardiologist MUST read the first test before you can access the data. This is not what is advertised - it is advertised that this is a tool you MAY share with your cardiologist and keep track of your rhythm.  I am returning it due to the misleading advertising.

For 24 years I have issued bands to my patients that I know will roll and slip (I know this because I have also used them in the past).  These bands are the best they do not roll or slip. They are sturdy and there isn't any pinching on your skin. The resistance is the strongest I've had the pleasure to use. They are well worth your money! I especially like the carrying case. My last set of bands I purchased didn't have a case/bag and I've misplaced a couple of my bands. This is a good investment in your health.

  Very happy with these booty bands.  Well made with comfortable non-slip grips, in pleasant colors, and clearly labelled with their resistance level.  Came with a convenient mesh carrying case, and a card with a sample training routine on one side and exercise poses on the other.  Also comes with cleaning instructions (which comes in handy for super sweaters like me).Overall, compared with booty bands I've purchased in the past, I would highly recommend these booty bands to anyone looking to add them to their home gym.

  I have been on the hunt for good quality bands for quite some time. I started to look for material bands but every one I came across wasn‚Äôt stretchy enough to do hip abductions or fire hydrants. There is 4 different levels and a workout user guide. Once I received them I immediately knew I found the bands I was looking for. Super stretchy, high quality and even comes with a rubber portion on the inside so they don‚Äôt slip. I am a very happy customer.

  The bands arrived packed nice and neat.  Each band was packed separately. There's a little mesh bag to store them after use so they can all breathe properly.  There are two cards in the pack as well.  One for an additional 20% off the next purchase and one with instructions on how to use (including a workout plan) and also how to wash.  There is a QR code included to access instruction videos as well.These bands are not difficult to understand, but they are certainly a challenge to the thighs and booty!  They've kicked my butt, and I'm only using the light band consistently.  I'm so glad I purchased these.  My squats will be forever improved with the use of these bands.

  I love these leg bands. I'm a dude with hairy legs and I've tried using other bands which end up pinching my skin and hair (no bueno).These bands are great in that they provide the resistance I want without pinching my skin or leg hair. The 4 step resistance bands provide the varied weight I need for difference exercises.Highly recommend.

  The problem with the zillions of sock reviews is that almost none of them tell you anything about the foot on which the sock ""fits great!!!!!"". Well, in my case the socks are stretched a bit too tight for my liking. I'm a somewhat narrow size 10.5. They're nearly sheer and squeeze my toes to an uncomfortable degree.They're a nice wicking synthetic, but they're very thin. Several have spots failing at the front of the toes. I'd have preferred a slightly heavier material that's not so elastic.

  These are garbage. They fall down the second you put your shoes on and take 10 steps. Dont waste your money or time. Target used to carry some very very good socks of this style and worked perfectly. I wore all mine out and have been looking for a replacement that actually stays on your feet. These are not it.  I donated mine. Complete waste of money. Hopefully someone that gets them finds them useful.

  I have been looking on Amazon for weeks for a solid pair of socks - after returning about 3 pairs, I finally found the ones.- These are almost true no-show socks with sneakers, which is so hard to find.  (Seen in picture)- Comfortable, padding on the bottom but thin on the top- Not overly padded, so my feet don't get hot- Thin top aren't too thin - I've had issues where the hair on my foot will get caught in some thin socks, not the case here.After confirming the quality holds up for a few weeks, I will be ordering a few more sets of these socks.  Highly recommend

  Bought these because we‚Äôve had shoes this brand that we‚Äôve liked, and the price for 6 pairs seemed like a good deal. After a single wear and wash, the pilling on them is terrible and these socks actually look worse than the old ones they were intended to replace.  Would not recommend or buy again. Pay a little more for a different brand.

  Bought these based off the cheap price and the Saucony name, which is my running shoe of choice...well the saying you get what you pay for definitely rang true here. They looked and felt great when tried on new/fresh, a little thin but was happy for the price. Literally got to wear them once before they started falling apart...pilling, threads coming out, holes starting. Its really unbelievable, they are like wear once or twice and toss socks... every single pair in the pack has followed suit. Needless to say wont be buying again and find it hard to believe Saucony has anything to do with these other than granting its name (which it should think twice about)..

  I've been wearing expensive socks for a long time, wool, toe socks, athletic socks. Not sure if I'm allowed to name drop? Regardless, you name it, I've tried them. I've been happy with some, but never really blown away. I mean, they're socks. If they do what they're supposed to, you don't think about them. These saucony have that wow factor for me because I don't miss my expensive socks. They fit my size 10.5 wide feet, they vent well, stay in place, comfy padding, no bunching or noticeable seams. If I had paid $13 for a pair of these, I wouldn't be dissatisfied, but the fact that I got 6 pairs for less than the price of one pair from those other brands, that to me is icing on the cake.

  I was hopeful as I love Saucony sneakers.  I just can‚Äôt recommend socks that get holes in them after wearing them twice.  I wore them for 12 hours at a time in my Sketchers.  Out of the six pairs, 2 pairs already have holes.  The other 4 pairs are already breaking down.  I am a size 13 foot, but still, these should not have holes that quick.

  I ordered 12 pair of these socks and I'm happy at this price.  They are polyester and have two mesh panels in the top so they breathe well and don't hold a lot of moisture.  That makes them comfortable for running.  I did an 11 mile run in a pair today when the socks arrived and I had no blisters or hot spots and the socks stayed in place, no slipping.  The polyester also means they won't pick up odors as bad as cotton socks.As for fit, I wear a size 10.5 US in a dress shoe and a 11 US in a running shoe.  The fit is fine for me, not loose, not tight, comfortable.I like the fact that you get 6 pair all the same color.  I hate trying to match up socks coming out of the dryer.  I tossed all my assorted other running socks in the trash.  Now, I've got 12 pairs of running socks and any two make a pair.  If I'm fishing through a drawer at 6AM in the dark for black socks, any two will make a pair.You can't beat the value.  6 pair for $14 is great.  I've had good wear from polyester running socks before so I expect these to hold up well.  If I get 6-12 months out of a dozen pair  for $28 bucks, I'm not gonna complain.EDIT 12/19/2019: I just trashed the first 12 pair and bought another 12.  I can't believe I got 3 years out of the first dozen.  They held up well running 2 days a week, gym workouts twice a week, and general summer wear.  At the end a few still looked pretty good.  But for this price I figure if I get a year, I'm happy.  Three years is amazing.

  We love the game KanJam. It is a huge hit outdoors during family gatherings. We are buying it for a wedding gift. However, the game only came with the two tubes, one frisbee disc, sticker labels, and instructions. NO original KanJam BOX to store the game in when not in use. Since it is a gift, I would like to present it to the receiver in the original packaging, not an Amazon box. I am disappointed because the item falsely advertises the original box and parts in the displaye image.

  These are a joke for $39 bucks. A cheap, cheap, cheap, Frisbee and 2 plastic sheets rolls that hook into a cylinders that are too low to work properly because they are so thin and flimsy. For this price you can go by 2 small  garbage cans and have a way better product with a good Frisbee.

  I tailgate.  There, I said it.Living in California, I don't own the largest car.  I have things I got to get to the game.  Coolers, tables, grill, you know, stuff.  I have to choose what makes it into the Prius.  The car is friggin full.  I'd love to take a cornhole set, but there's no way it would fit.  So I bought Kan Jam as a similar game that takes up way less space.But here's why it's better, and I didn't know this before owning it.  When your teammate is throwing, you have to help.  You have to guide the frisbee.  In cornhole, you just kinda cheer and hope for the best.  In Kan Jam, you can save a bad throw by your teammate, or slam it home for the points.  It's way more of a team sport.Does it seem a little expensive?  Maybe, but those plastic cans hold up.  They've been through 12 home games and are still fully functional.  Will it bring you more joy than three $20 movie tickets?  Abso-effing-lutely.  If you're on the fence for a yard game, get this while you research plans to build your own cornhole set.

  This is a great yard game to add to my ever-growing collection. My friends and family love it, and it's a neat new concept for a me vs. you team game. The cans fold flat for easy storage, and the rules are very simple.My main complaint is that the included Frisbee is heavy and hurts your hand/fingers after awhile when you try to smack or deflect it out of the air. Also, it's very susceptible to any sort of breeze. I donated my kan jam disc to charity and instead substituted my trusty Aerobie 10"" Superdisc which flies much better in wind, is easier to control, and has nice soft edges which are much more kid and family friendly IMO.

  This game is super fun to play outside, but especially on grass or sand (which allows for players to make some epic dives in attempts to deflect the incoming disc thrown by your teammate).  You can also play on concrete but the disc will get scratched up pretty easily as it slides along the ground in the event of any far misses (which there will probably be a lot of for non-pro level players like myself).  My only gripe about the set is that it should come with a short bungee cord or something similar to wrap around the black plastic goals to make it easier to transport.  The box it comes in is supposed to be used as a carrying case but no one wants to lug around a bulky box to carry this game around!  The goals easily fit in a decent-sized duffel bag.  I got a bungee cord myself to wrap around them to keep it compact but it would have been nice if a cord were included in the purchase.  Anyway...Happy gaming!

  My nephews introduced me to this game and it is FUN! It's a team game so fun to get the whole family involved. Basically you have one member from each team by one of the ""goals"" the other member stands by the other goal and throws the Frisbee trying to get it into the goal basket. The teammate close to the goal basket hits the Frisbee to help it either go inside or touch the goal basket in order to get points for their team.  Then that team member throws the Frisbee back attempting to do the same thing with the other teammate trying to help the Frisbee go into the other goal basket.The number of points each toss can get depends on if the Frisbee goes into the basket without help, with help, or touches the goal basket with or without help.the first team to make it to 21 points wins.This is a great game for Summer!

  I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù ~125lbs and a 34B. I ordered both the small & medium to see which I would like better. Both fit me but the small was more compressive whereas the medium gave more of a relaxed fit. Specifically around the bust where the under bra elastic is and the straps on my shoulders. So honestly you can fit in your normal size and the one above, it just depends on how tight you want it to be! Other than that, the shirt is buttery soft & super flattering on! Also, I bought the white shirt and thought you would be able to see the padding but I can‚Äôt so I‚Äôm happy about that! Hope this helps!

  First of all the plastic is very hard to bend and I was afraid I was going to break it while trying to get the spiky part hooked into the bottom. I realize it‚Äôs got to be heavy duty plastic to hold people‚Äôs bodyweight but it is hard to get it into the groove.Once you get it set up, it feels so good on your back. I am an almost 40 mom of 3 so I am starting to struggle more with aches and pains. The stretch it provides me with reminds me of a traction table at a chiropractor‚Äôs office but not quite as good. My upper back is where I hold a lot of stress and therefore it bothers me far more than my lower back. This stretcher didn‚Äôt help as much with my upper back even when shifted further up. I didn‚Äôt realize how stiff my lower back was until I was laying on this! It felt so nice especially with my knees bent and rolling ever so slightly from side to side so the nubs would hit my whole lower back. I would definitely say this device works great for stretching your lower back out and relieving lower back pain. The spikes aren‚Äôt super sharp to the touch so there‚Äôs not pain caused by them. I‚Äôm still on the hunt for something to help with my upper back/shoulder blade pain but I will definitely be using this on the regular!

  So...this back stretcher really works, but be advised to start at the lowest curvature first. It may not look so menacing, but above the first level, there is a significant arching of the back during the laying on this thing and it can quickly cause discomfort. You need to work yourself up slowly to the 2nd and 3rd level of this device. It really works as well as an Inversion table. Great purchase and I highly recommend it

  Eases back pain and is very comfortable when I use it in the upright position while sitting on the couch and especially when driving. The support is adjustable depending on where and how you use the device. When using it laying down, start with the device in the lowest, thinnest setting and work your way to the higher settings as your back begins to adjust. Highly recommend the Back Stretcher to anyone with back pain.

  This was not the least nor most expensive Back Stretcher.  The unit I had bought in the past was no longer available.  Since I've used these for a three years, I feel confident in pointing out one glaring flaw.  The 'insert' is not tabbed at each end and therefore dislodges from the unit 'every' time it is used.  I purchased two of these and although I will not return them, find this oversight very frustrating.  This does affect the overall effectiveness of the stretcher, because any movement of the back causes the strip to pop out of the slots and shift.  The unit does provide relief, but must be used much more carefully.

  The board that needs to be bent and placed into the grooves of the bottom board is pretty stiff so the initial assembly is a bit challenging.Also, this is not exactly a miracle worker, I didn‚Äôt really feel any different in my back after a week of use, I think I‚Äôll stick to the traditional foam rolling method.

  I really like this exercise mat! I am a regular exerciser and have gone through tons of mats. This one is definitely thicker than most, and also longer than most! That‚Äôs a plus because I‚Äôm 5ft9 and I sometimes feel like mats are way too short for me when laying down to do sit-ups or stretches. Unlike other reviewers, my mat came with absolutely so smell whatsoever, even when I have my face on it doing yoga. I got the red color and it‚Äôs vibrant and beautiful. The color does not transfer like some super-cheap mats I‚Äôve owned that eventually stain my hands and knees when things get sweaty. I also love using this for cardio with jumps. It has great cushion for landing which is soft on the feet and knees. I also appreciate the extra padding when doing yoga poses like cat/cow because otherwise my hardwood floors really hurt my knees. While it does squish slightly and leave hand and foot dents momentarily, it quickly springs back to its normal shape. Some reviewers mentioned the extra padding being a nuisance when standing on your feet in tough-to-balance yoga poses like tree, but I have have absolutely no problems and it actually feels better on my feet than the hardwood floor or super-thin mats. It has good grip and doesn‚Äôt move around or slip even when barefoot. I really like that the ridges on the top of the mat run in parallel lines in only one direction, rather than being cross-hatched or bumpy. Mats with other patterns like that are much harder to wipe clean when dirt gets stuck in the ridges. I also appreciate the included carrying strap to keep it rolled up and to carry it around. Some reviewers complain that the mat is too big and bulky, but I like the thickness and length when using it, so of course it‚Äôs a bit bigger than the thin-as-paper mats when rolled up. Duh! Overall, another solid Amazon Basics product. Every Amazon product I‚Äôve purchased so far has been of great quality for the price. Edit: see the photo of this red mat next to my old purple mat. It‚Äôs a couple inches longer than a standard mat and about 3x as thick!

  This mat is awesome! Im an extremely overweight individual trying to get fit and I purchased this mat in hopes of using it to do my floor exercises on, such as sit ups, instead of the bare, hardwood floor. This matter was PERFECT! I honestly wasnt expecting it to be as thick as it was! I was able to comfortably get down on the floor without my knees feeling like they were going break on the floor. Matter of fact, my knees didnt even touch the floor! I also love how its NOT memory foam. Memory foam sinks to your body's pressure and I wanted something that stay firm, but supportive and this matter is it!

  This mat is reasonably priced, but there are a few things I think potential buyers should know:1. You can't wear shoes on this matI learned this the hard way, after my sneakers scuffed up the mat after a workout session. I could probably have ended up tearing my mat if i continued to wear shoes while using it. Barefoot or socks only if you wish to keep it in good condition for longer.2. It's slippery when wetThis thing turns into a slip-and-slide if you drip sweat on it. Not fun when trying to downward dog.3. It tends to move around a bit during use.Not a huge issue, but it can be annoying at times.All things considered, I like this mat. It fit my budget, and it's a good size. It's my first, so i have nothing to compare it to. But it did fall short in some areas that mattered to me.

  Ok, I admit it's early in our relationship - but I like this mat. The smell is WAY overstated by some folks - I used this mat in yoga class 20 minutes after I cut it out of the plastic and it smelled a LOT better than the shared mats in my yoga class.  I later learned this mat is too thick for yoga and I need a 1/4 inch thick mat... ok, I get it but I'm over 6' 2"" and I am built more like a lineman than a tall ballerina - so this mat works fine. When I do tree pose my weight converts this mat into a sub-quarter inch thick mat and I don't have any issues with a too-soft mat.I'm sure the strap that came with it is fine  - I gave it to my wife who uses it with her 1/4 inch mat ...It seems to be a good mat even though it's disadvantaged having no high-end trademark by a famous equipment company with model spokespersons ... it's just a low price thick green Amazon mat and so far it's rocking the task -

  This mat has a chemical smell that attaches to you like in the Seinfeld episode The Smelly Car.  I have tried everything to get rid of it including ivory dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, febreze, over ten days of sun and fresh air, and eventually an industrial washing machine.  The smell has defeated all of these methods which is quite impressive.  I did use it twice, and it was nice. However, I cannot take the smell.

  Worst purchase ever. I bought this on May 1st 2018 and have had it sitting out trying to air out. Today is June 10 and it still smells like cat pee, And I don't own a cat!! The stench just permeates the room. I would be far too embarrassed to take this to a yoga class. I have sprayed it down TWICE with super grade odor neutralizer and still ZERO luck. Save your money and absolutely look for something else.  Stay with 1/2 inch though, as that's a great thickness. But don't buy here, unless you want this horrible stench to linger in your home or embarrass you in class too.

  Love this mat!  I use this at home for ""off days"" from the gym, for mat exercises and/or stretching.  It has sufficient padding to not hurt the knees or back, and to feel comfortable doing exercises.  It rolls out nicely, and didn't quickly roll back after being unrolled - like some of the other ones I've had.  It smelled a little funny (plastic-y) at first, but that went away after a day of having it out/unrolled.  The length is quite long and fits all 5'4 of me. For the price and quality, I'd surely recommend!

  So far these bands have been a big help. I have been using them for a couple of weeks now and the durability of them haven't worn out yet. I tried some other bands and they have ripped after only a couple of uses. Range of motion is really good compared to others. Other than that I would rate it a 4/5 stars.

  I wanted to like this and I will start out with the only positive I can think about this product.  It's small and easy to hide.  Originally I was going to give this three stars but the negatives added up and then they updated the app and made things much worse.  You can view history and set alarms on both the phone app and the web interface.  However each interface has different abilities with some options on one but not the other.  The maps looked similar until the phone app updated.  The mess of lines when tracking history became even more unbearable as it lost the function of telling you the direction of travel on the phone app.  You can export a log file but it has no real support for viewing on google earth, you loose all track lines and are stuck with random dot points.  Pulling up history often limits you to pulling up a full days worth of tracking.  So it's not easy to single out a hour or two of when you knew a particular event happened or perhaps the time a particular person was driving unless you want to download the file and alter it using third party software..Battery life was bad.  If you are actually tracking a moving object it takes more power.  I did stretch it out to 2.5 days once or twice but many days I had to charge it everyday.  To overcome this I was going to hard wire it into the vehicle... until they updated the app.  Also note that being discrete in removing and installing it so often to charge the tracker is difficult to do. Also hard wiring it in defeats the purpose of having a small device.  I even tried the low power setting turning the device off for 15 minutes then on for 5 to take a reading but it did not help much.  Instructions for doing that are pretty much non existent but you can make these changes on the web interface but not the app.  The app was slightly better at giving you more options for past history as long as it was in the past 24 hours.  But no matter what way you checked history after a day went past you only could view full days at a time.  At it's best this tracker can update once a minute.  This is actually the slowest setting for other trackers, some update every 3 to 5 seconds.  What this means is that often the track will not follow roads.  I also used other trackers that easily lasted 2 full weeks vs 1 day this unit often gave me.  At one minute intervals it was possible to see many stops when other people got into the car.  But reducing the intervals in attempt to save battery life lost the ability to see people pull over to pick somebody up.  It also makes it impossible to determine what roads were actually used. It does not track data like miles driven like others do.  In terms of functionally I had better luck with free apps on an old cell phone.  Oops I dropped my phone in the car again? Silly me.  The ""magnetic mount"" is actually a magnet attached to velcro and made no sense to me.  The app lost functionality after they updated it.  It also changed to a very plain looking map by default that actually makes it difficult to figure out the location.  You can change the view to something more viewable but it always changes itself back to the default view I dislike.Update 10/17/2019As mentioned before originally I was going to give this a three star review but ended up giving it one star for all the things I already mentioned.  So how did we get to this point?  I am actually giving it five stars at this point.A representative reached out to me.  He was very professional and actually appreciated my negative input.  But more importantly I was under the impression that they strive to make the product better.  I waited to update this review though, perhaps a little too long.  I wanted to see the actions and improvements first.  But yeah, customer service and attention to detail really impressed me.So what about those improvements that I am talking about?  Both the web interface and the Android app received updates.  The battery saving function is now available on all formats and it was simplified to set up.  History can now be looked up without the cluttered mess of looking at a full day.  The map now retains your preferred method of viewing it, the arrows are back indicating direction of travel.  I added another photo so you can see for yourself the difference between the old app map and the new one that indicates direction of travel. The app is also less cluttered looking but at the same time gives you more available information.  I no longer have to switch from the app to pc to get all features as everything is more uniform.  I was told they would attempt to add even more features and I believe they will.The unit itself is currently selling below the competitors.  It accurate.  The monthly fee is also below most competitors.  Battery life is still somewhat of a disappointment to me.  But it normally falls between what they claim.  For me usually two days as this point but at times it surprises me with a third day.  I can't take a star off for this as it is in a normal variance and as advertised.  However the thing with this device is that you can choose what you want.  A small device that is very lightweight for a kid to carry in a backpack or...... Get the optional battery pack/water proof holder with magnetic mount.  The choice is up to you.  I have not used the the extended battery pack yet but it's charging now as I write this.  Although it does add size to the small tracker it does not make it any larger than the competitors in other waterproof cases.  I will perhaps update after I get familiar with how well the case/extended battery works.  For now though this company has completely turned my opinion around with great customer service.Update 12/03/2020I just cancelled my service.  I just wanted to say that this company changed so much in the time I started to use them.  I originally hated this product but it has given me piece of mind many times.  The reason I cancelled it is because my kid turned 18 and has a job now.  I no longer feel I should track his every movement as he is now an adult.With the extended battery I had no problem going weeks before it needed a recharge.  When the battery level dropped down to 10% I would get a low batt warning.  The battery would still last about 5 days after getting the first warning (with the optional pack).  The standard battery is poor though.I found the service itself to be accurate.  They added many things such as running mileage and other reports.  In some areas sometimes it gives you readings of KPH instead of MPH despite everything being set up correctly.Overall I am now a happy customer.  Customer service always responded quickly to my concerns.  Perhaps come spring time I will install this unit to track my motorcycle and get service for it turned back on but at this point it's no longer needed.

  We initially got a GPS tracking device to be able to track our special needs son in the event he would go missing.  We pin it to his pocket when he goes to school, when we are out and about on the weekends, and when we go out of town or on vacation.  Our biggest fear is that one day he will go missing and he won't be able to communicate to someone who he is, where he lives, what the home number is, etc.  With this device and the phone app, we have piece of mind that if he ever goes missing, we will be able to find where he is at.  We love the comfort of knowing where he is at that we go one for our other child who is not special needs, just in case.We used to have another GPS tracking device that we used for a number of years, but that (as many of the older GPS tracking devices do) worked on the G2 network which is slowly being phased out.  Over the last few years we've seen a lot of the functionality on that other GPS tracker go away.  The thought of not being able to track our son was heartbreaking for us and finding a replacement GPS tracker was difficult to do because they all were using the 2G network.  We finally found this Tracki device and per the specs it runs on the 3G network.  I was so excited when we found this we immediately ordered a set of them.  I will have to say I was skeptic at first because it seemed like such a new product (we ordered ours in August and all the reviews we were able to find anywhere were only from a few months ago) but we figured we had nothing to loose, if we weren't happy, we could cancel service.  I will have to say that this device and the company have far exceeded my expectations and my experience with other devices.The price of the device is extremely reasonable.  The plans are great.  Right now, since we've been trying it out we went with the month to month plan, but at some point we will switch to one of their yearly plans, which will save us money.The app is still relatively new.  It was released in March 2019 and they are at version 2.3.  I can say that it has greatly improved and they are constantly making improvements and releasing updates.  The app will get a notification for any of the triggers you setup (such as enter or leave a zone you define).  If you want other people to get notified of activities, they don't need to have the app, you can setup the app to send text messages to specific mobile numbers and you can also set it up to send e-mail to specific e-mail address.  It will show you the batter life that remains for the device, and you can set it to notify you if the device hits a percent battery life so that you know it's time to recharge the battery.  The batter life is great, we go a few days without having to charge it.  You can set it up to refresh location every 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 minutes or even 1, 2, or 4 hours.  The app will even let you ""ping"" the device so that it will beep.  We've used this option a few times when the kids didn't remember exactly where in the house they put their device.  This is a great feature!!  It will also let you see past history of the device movement, this might come in handy at some point if anyone goes missing.The device has some nice features as well.  It has a power button so you can turn the device off at night.  Other's don't have this.  We power them down when the kids come home, that saves batter life.  It has 3 buttons, one is an SOS button in case your child runs into problems, it will notify the app on the phone and let you know the SOS button was pressed.  It has 2 other buttons as well that you can use for whatever you want to be notified for.  It comes with a clip that you can put on, so a child can clip it to their pants.  It has a little ring loop that you can put a key ring on.  We put a small cable tie with a safety pin so that we could pin it to our sons pockets to make it harder to take off.You may see comments that say that the device is not accurate.  I will say, based on experience on trying several GPS tracking devices, they are all like that.  It might not update the second you look at the app, but it will update, just give it time.I've called customer support twice for help on two different items, and they were VERY accommodating and EXTREMELY helpful.  In the ""Help - Contact Support"" section of the app, it has a button to ""Call Support"", so they make it easy to get a hold of them when you need to.

  I've been involved with tracking devices since 2007. At the time they were $750. wholesale costs. The devices could only used GPS either direct or reflective mode. Anyway, these guys got it right.GPS is very sensitive. If GPS is not available due to satellite obstruction, then the unit switches to Cell Tower triangulation which is not as accurate as GPS, but still very good. Furthermore, the unit can pole the WIFI hotspots in the area to get a good location.Word is out on an update adding some additional features, once released will prove to be a valuable add-on.So, would I recommend one to any of my relatives, yes, only if I don't want them to get lost.Good product and great service.Charles

  It is a very good device and the application is superb! Customer service is the best I have ever encountered!I change my review after a call from one of the developers. I was assured that my problem of too many false alarms will be fixed in the soon to come update (an option to only send alarms based on the GPS data and not from mobile antenas)So since I saw how they really care for their customers and since this device already saved my dog once (when I saw that it's not moving so I went there and saw her being cought in a fence and couldn't find the way out). I changed my review to 5 stars.

  I was skeptical about getting the product. But I‚Äôve been wearing it for a little over a week now and it is truly amazing! If you look at the picture you can see how I was a bit slouched in my stance and when I put the Posture Corrector on it helped straighten up my stance.When tighten the straps, it pushes my shoulders back & straightens my back up to a comfortable position. At first it was uncomfortable to wear but my body began to adjust over the next few days and the benefits of this products have been very rewarding.I am a daycare provider and I am constantly picking keeps up daily, especially when changing diapers... it‚Äôs puts a strain on my shoulders and back when lifting but since wearing this, it has helped me with my rightful lifting techniques.

  I bought this product for my mother because I noticed that she had been complaining about her mid-back hurting and that she kept on driving her shoulder forward from using her phone so much.  I didn't believe the ""STOP looking down at your phone so much...you're gonna get that form"".  Well, it's true. I waited about 2 weeks before giving an honest review and I am so happy that I got this for my mom.  She doesn't have pain that much anymore and it's significantly subsiding as the days progress. Before, she couldn't raise her hand above shoulder height because her back was strained from being in a hunched position all day because COVID-19 has restricted much activities. Anyway, now she's extremely happy that she uses it and is happy that she can hang her fresh laundry on the clothesline. Seeing her happy and pain-free really makes me smile during these times.  I do want to point out that she does use it for more than 15 minutes.  I think she uses it for about 1-2 hours then takes it off to stretch and then puts it on after a couple hours.

  This was exactly what I needed! I work at a desk all day, or I'm on my phone, or I'm doing my nails, or playing video games and posture has just become and after thought. I saw a doctor who suggested I see a chiropractor and get a massage and practice correct posture to get rid of my tension migraines. This has helped tremendously so much so that I remember to keep better posture even when I'm not wearing it. I love that it is adjustable so I can wear it over big fluffy sweaters or under my cardigan. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion and I am so glad I did!

  I have chronic upper back pain as a result of poor posture, that started during puberty. As a petite, big busted woman, I would often hunch over for ‚Äúmodesty‚Äù, to the point that I considered getting breast reduction surgery from the back pain, but couldn‚Äôt afford it. I went to chiropractors and physiotherapists, anything to alleviate my pain. An orthopedic surgeon said I started developing osteoarthritic changes in my cervical bone, despite being in my 30s! At this point, as you can imagine, I‚Äôm willing to try anything! I wear this at home in the evenings for an hour or so, and it‚Äôs making me more conscious of my posture at all times, even when I‚Äôm not wearing it. It does alleviate my upper back pain, at least temporarily. For the cost, I think that‚Äôs a win! I may need to incorporate some back exercises to correct my posture, as this alone may not cut it, but all in all, it‚Äôs definitely helped my posture to some extent. I find myself adjusted my posture at work, when I drive, when I‚Äôm at my desk, etc. thanks to this getting me in the habit.

  Didn‚Äôt know I needed this! I started working 1 year ago and started experiencing lower back pain. People always say I have good posture, so I didn‚Äôt think that was the problem. However, when I sit at my desk for a long time, I think I start to slouch. I just wear this at home when I‚Äôm watching tv or cooking, and I‚Äôve already noticed a big difference! I think everyone‚Äôs different so you might want to play around with it and see what works for you! Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been working for me.TIPS:- I started out by keeping it loose so instead of strictly holding my shoulders back, it just prevented me from bringing them forward. Overtime, I made it tighter so I can be slowly adjusted to better posture rather expecting myself to snap into it right away!- I wear it over a shirt so it‚Äôs more comfortable! I noticed that some people complained it‚Äôs uncomfortable under your armpits but just wear it over something!

  I have been having some back pain for while now. This works for me. Its not to hard to put on, it even comes with instructions on how to put it on. I have bought a few in the past (different kinds) and this one seems to fit better and be a little more comfortable. You have read some reviews about how uncomfortable they are and yes they are not like sleeping on clouds. This is made for you to wear to relieve some back pain and to help your posture. There is going to some discomfort around your ""underarm"" area but for me its not to much of a bother vs the pain I have from my back by not using this. I am a 40 year old man that is 5 ft 10 in. 260 lbs. I wear this under my shirt so it would not make my dress shirts all messes up. If you do it is a good idea to work an undershirt. If you are looking for something that is going to feel like heaven than you might was well stop looking for something like this. If you are looking for something that is going to help with your posture and/or relieve some back pain you should try this. Just remember that its not going to be very comfortable but it is also not going to be something you can not stand if you put it on right.

  ¬†I‚Äôve only had these for a week, so I feel that a longer period of ownership and use is necessary to give a more accurate review of the durability of these bands. That being said, they‚Äôve held up great so far. They‚Äôve been awesome to use for resistance training and especially my leg workouts, I have arthritis in both knees from my time in the Army and struggle to do heavy weights on leg day. So I opted for resistance training instead, and these have been perfect for it. I also injured my left shoulder in the military, so I‚Äôve been using these in place of the cheap physical therapy bands I‚Äôm always issued by the VA. Excellent product so far, and with the accessories you can do a wide variety of exercises. The ankle bands are a bonus, allowing me to target leg muscles I couldn‚Äôt normally do with other resistance bands.

  There‚Äôs very little (if anything) to dislike about these resistance bands. They are adjustable and their versatility allows for them to be used to complete a large variety of exercises. Everything from curls, chest presses, toes, and even squats. The major determining factor for me was being able to adjust the weight up to 150lbs. Not only that but it comes with ankle bands and a block that allows you to attach to your doorway to get even more exercises. They even include a pouch if you want to take them with you on the go!

Wide variety of exercises possible - comes with suggested exercise, but you can make your own variations, too.  4.  ""Stackable"" - you can add the tension bands together for more resistance.  5.  Both color-coded and resistance level written in pounds on each band.  6.  Comfortable, sturdy grips.  7.  Quick change-out clips are excellent.  8.  Comes with ankle straps.CONS1.  I have a couple of ""competitor"" tension band products from prior purchases (SPIRIT brand) that have a bit more length and so offer a bigger range of motion for certain exercises.  I use both, but you can probably get away with one product.I like working out at home because it saves time and money.  I am in the best shape since my 30's with these and I am very soon 51.  I'm genuinely impressed that these, along with Pilates, and a doorframe pullup bar have given me a better physique than I've had in twenty years.  Less wear-and-tear on the joints, too, which is important as we age.  Give them a try!If I come up with any concerns or problems I will add that to this review.

  Im a big guy 6‚Äô1 330 lbs and this set is very sturdy. The set comes with  five bands 10- 50 pound of resistance. It also comes with ankle straps, 2 handles, a door anchor, and an I struction booklet with a detailed description of different exercises! They have sturdy construction and are very easy to use! Highly recommended!

  Like a gazillion other people I started building a home gym when COVID started. Ordered early and was lucky to get all the main pieces but I didn't order any dumbells. Once I went to add them, zero luck. I was hoping to score a set of adjustables like the Bowflex ones, but they're out of stock most anywhere unless you're willing to pay double retail via eBay.When I saw these I thought there's no way they actually work but they had a ton of positive reviews and Amazon makes returns so easy I figured why not, they'll probably suck and I'll just send them back. So I ordered last night, got them today and I'm happy to say I was totally wrong!They're not dumbbells so it's a different experience. The resistance gets harder as you go through the range of motion, versus with a dumbbell it's the full weight from the moment you pick it up. So if you're doing curls, for example, you don't start to really feel it until you're maybe 1/3 the way through the range of motion and it gets progressively harder as you get towards the top of the rep.That said, they are a pretty amazing alternative. You can do a legit workout with them and the exercises you can do are really only limited by your creativity. In the picture I posted I wrapped them around one of the stands on my power rack to do seated rows. If you want to go heavier just clip both ends to the same handle and do them one arm.I can't speak to how long they'll hold up, but I also only paid $50 so I'm not that concerned.Added bonus, my five-year-old son thinks they're totally fun. I threw the whole thing over the pull up bar on the rack and he spend an hour being a gymnast on them. They're worth the price just for that!Totally satisified and already recommended them to a couple of people.

  This product is false advertising. I have a different set of bands similar to this. I purchased this one because it advertised 50lb resistance. It doesn‚Äôt. Everything is half the weight. I thought I‚Äôd try to get more resistance for days I can‚Äôt make it to the gym. The pictures clearly show that the girth of the cable that claims 50lb resistance is the same as my other one that shows 25lb resistance. About to get my money back. Upon using, they both have the same resistance.Update: they have done right by me.

  Terrible, terrible product. I‚Äôve now had two of these resistance band sets and the bands keep snapping (pretty much the exact opposite of what you want). They don‚Äôt provide a customer service number and claim that only Amazon can fulfill a refund or exchange, even though the materials provided in the box claim a 100% Money Back Guarantee. This is a bad, bad company, DON‚ÄôT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!

  So far they are great. Really like the fact that they are stackable. My husband and I workout together so to be able to easily unclip and clip again without taking all the bands down really stood out to us. So far so good. Would purchase again and I‚Äôve already recommended to some friends.

  I like this trunk mount, i does the job if you install it CORRECTLYPros: - It fits most sedans or hatchback cars - It holds two adult bikes no problem - Looks and feels well made - Straps are solid - Pads are good enough to keep it from scratching your trunk or glass if you have a hatchback - Installs in minutesCons: - None so farOverall i really like this trunk mount, i drove 36 miles at about 70 MPH and the unit felt solid with two adult bikes in the back.Before you head out MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL the mount correctly to avoid any accidents!!!!!What i did is I`ve added few weatherstrip seal to each hook to keep it from scratching the paint on my car, but once you apply pressure the seal comes off easily so i decided to change the location of the hooks and set it up INSIDE my trunk (Please look at the pictures to see where i install them) it works WAY BETTER and also is more secure and doesn`t scratch your trunk.I also added a bungee cord once the bikes are hold in place just in case Murphy's law :-)[...]If you have any questions you can ask me: marquino17@gmail.com

  The Allen Sport's website says this model does not fit the Corolla S because of the clearance of the rack onto the trunk over the spoiler. I decided to give it a shot anyway as the price was so cheap. Here is my finding..First, the rack has a warning about the two metal hooks you have to set into place during assembly being a pinch point. Do not ignore this. I wore a glove when setting them and had no issues but I can definitely see how someone could get hurt. Assembly was simple, basically that was the only step.Second, if you set the bottom pads of the rack against your license plate and the top on the trunk, it clears the spoiler fine. The metal hooks mentioned earlier do rest against the spoiler and can easily cause scratches. I used a piece of foam to separate and it worked out fine.Third, many reviews mention the hooks that attach to the sides of the trunk scratching the paint. I used a piece of foam with an adhesive side under each hook to keep it off the paint, no issues.Fourth, an extra bungee comes in handy to keep loose bits like the front tire from moving around too much. Get creative.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. The rack is being used for one bike but I don't think a second one would cause an issue with this set up. Again, great price to not at least give it a shot. Glad I did.

  A lot of the negative reviews on here say that their strap failed on the highway and/ or on long trips. Never trust the straps, they are only made to keep the bikes from sliding around on the rack. ALWAYS bungee your bikes to the rack AND to themselves if you have more than one. Bungee cords are cheap. Bikes are expensive. Do the math.

  While the manufacturer's web site does not mention Tesla compatibility, I decided to take a risk and bought this bike rack 102DN model.It fits Tesla Model 3 well - there are 5 clips : two on top, two on the sides and one at the bottom - each with adjustable strap. It took me about 15 min to ""assemble"" (unfold and attach two pins) and install the rack. Once you have the straps adjusted for proper length, it should take just couple minutes to get this rack installed.The rack does not prevent trunk from opening and should not hit rear window - see the photo in the review - however it is quite hard to open the trunk with the bike mounted on it :)I bought two bike rack and like the tie-downs - as these tie-downs are secured in specific positions for each bike. I would strongly suggest to get couple bungee cords - so you can secure front wheels.

  I was initially looking for a roof rack mounting system, but at $300+, I couldn't justify it just yet. Once I came across this item, I was skeptical at first, as I read mixed reviews, and then the much lower price than most other systems. Also, I'm using this on a 2007 Nissan Sentra.However, after having owed this for a couple months now, I can safely say my doubts are gone! I've used it about a dozen times for short in town trips, but the real kicker was my most recent trip home. I still had one bike at my parents‚Äô house in SE Wisconsin that I wanted with me, near Nashville, TN. To be  honest, I had my reservations about using this over 600 miles at highway speeds. Turns out my fear was for naught! Thankfully!The directions are very clear on how to tie off the main supports as an added security measure. I also saw that another reviewer had wrapped the metal latches with electrical tape to prevent scratching. I followed suit, and so far I have none. The only thing to be careful of (and they have red warning stickers pointing this out) is when you put the silver colored wire struts in place BE CAREFUL! You can easily pinch your fingers.Again, this is a fantastic product, and great bang for your buck! I highly recommend. Also, this isn't a verified purchase because I bought it through Wally World, not Amazon.

  The first one had the ropes on backward, which is fine for your more daring baby who prefers to swing upside down. Because the child's spoilsport grandmother wouldn't go along, we returned it for a version that swings right side up. We very pleased with that admittedly somewhat more boring configuration.

  Can't find a link to contact the seller so I'm trying this.The swing is well above our heads when mounted indoors. The ropes are very short and wont work for us indoor or outdoor. We already threw out the box it came in. Can we return this with a different box?We don't know how to safely extend the rope. Is there something you'd recommend?I really think the product description should say that this swing is designed for a swing-set. Someone looking to connect to ceiling or tree would be better off buying something else. It's really a bummer that we are going to have to buy rope or chain and rig something up to make this work for us. I don't want to take the swing apart and replace the ropes because that doesn't seem safe.

  be careful how you hang this thing because if you hang it the way you're told to by the directions, the rope could come out of the bracket and leave your small baby dangling sideways and terrified like it did mine. Hang it by the carabiners only.

  It's been up for almost two years and I am very pleased.I purchased separate smooth swinging eye swivels to hook them to. I bought two of these and my grandchildren love them.Easy adjustment, easy in and out with straightforward adjustments once my grandkids are in them.Even though they are not intended for older kids, I have a niece who is in 3rd grade and she sat in them and swung without breaking. Very comfortable and no pinch-points so far.You can control the tilt of the swing easily to accommodate little ones that don't have a lot of neck strength yet.Lots of fun, easy to hang and I highly recommend these toddler swings that will see many years of use!

  Okay, so we're not using this with a swing set, we're using it with a 90 foot zip line in the back yard. We put our one year old grand daughter on the zip line seat, and held her in place for a couple rides. When it was time to get off, the world exploded! Major tantrum! So, I ordered this so we wouldn't have to hold her in place and BINGO!! Works great and she LOVES IT!! My back loves it too! I'm sure it would work every bit as well with a swing set. No issues or concerns with safety using this swing seat, though we make all the kids (ages 1,4,5 and6) wear helmets when riding.

  Very sturdy and well built swing. It holds my squirmy 1.5 year old very securely, and the safety clasps are out of reach for him to manipulate. Every time we play outside he will ask to go in his swing. It seems very comfortable for him because he falls asleep in it and he never complains while in it like he does when he's in one of those thick rubber bucket seats you find at public parks. I was so pleased with the swing, I purchased a second one for our property. Very easy to get him in and out. When hanging the seat from a tree branch, I'd recommend pairing with a canvas/nylon swing strap and not to use a chain directly around the branch. At first I used a chain from Lowe's to wrap around a 6 inch thick branch, and about a month and a halfs worth of repetitive use caused the chain to saw about 1/3rd through the branch. Excellent product and very highly recommended over the other products on the market

  I'm a club volleyball coach and we often have to bring our own bag of balls to tournaments, even the ones where we have to fly there.I bought this a while ago to keep in my coaching backpack (which is filled to the brim with things, like a first aid kit, a few clipboards, notebooks, coaching tools, etc.) and both the pump and the needle have not broken at all. I was worried about having the needle in the ball pump and putting it in my backpack, but after months of throwing that backpack around and lugging it all over the country, it hasn't bent, snapped, etc. at all.On top of that, it's pretty ergonomic and so it's pretty easy to use. I had to use it once in a quick situation during warmups and I was able to re-inflate a ball while also talking to the players about strategies for the game that was about to start.Highly recommend!!

  This was more amazing than I expected. With so many disappointments, I was ready for another one, but with the high reviews, I took a chance. AND, wow! It worked so well.

  I have a 4 year old child that has quite the collection of balls so having an air pump is not a luxury, but a necessity in our house.  Before ordering the Sportbit I had previously only ever used the standard model ball pump.  I like the compact size of the Sportbit pump and it‚Äôs definitely an all around improvement from the ball pumps I‚Äôve been using.  It‚Äôs priced fairly and come with 5 needles.  One thing I‚Äôm not yet able to speak for is the longevity and durability of this pump.  I‚Äôve had it for just 2 days at the time of writing this review.  With that said I like the Sportbit‚Äôs size and effectiveness.  If it‚Äôs hold up to periodic use for a long time, and I have no reason to believe it won‚Äôt, then it will have more than payed for itself.  I would recommend purchasing this pump.

  The ball pump arrived with five needles, as stated and there's a free ebook(have to check that out still) just as advertised. The pump and needles appear well made and durable. It's compact whick seems nice for toting to the park but I had some concern when ordering about whether it would be strong enough. We used it right away to pump up a mushy basketball. The handle has a comfortable ergonomic grip at the ball side that is a bit easier to hold while pumping than my previous completely straight pump. I like the soft grip material on the pump side also. It maintains good pressure and only took a few pumps to fill the ball, no leaking while filling. The soft needle plug is a nice feature. The needle was easy to install and I can see how it will help prevent bent needles. All in all, I'm happy with this pump and can definitely recommend it.

  When I was a kid, we used bicycle pumps to put air in our basketballs and footballs. I gave this to my 8'yr old granddaughter who loves to play basket ball and she was very frustrated with it. You have to pump it a million times to get any air to move, and in frustration she passed it off to me. I found that as the ball got to it's finished pressure, that I had to pump faster and faster to get it to fill. In other words, it would have been impossible for a kid, and frustrating for me. I wished I had my old bike pump from my kid days again. The other challenge (of course) is that there is no air pressure gauge on it... but it's pretty clear to me that there's no way you could OVER inflate a ball with this pump.

  So far so good. My daughter plays every sport under the sun so a pump like this is essential. She finally got that basketball aired up after months of it just sitting and collecting dust.The best part of this product is the customer service experience. I received both a shipping notification email and a confirmation of product receipt email from the company. You just don‚Äôt see that personal touch very often these days, so I‚Äôm always incredibly impressed when I find a vendor/company who also recognizes that customer satisfaction should always be the ultimate goal.

  So the moveable tip worried and threw me off the first couple times of using it, but now that we are used to it, it is great.  Even when we were not used to it, it was great.  Works as advertised, comes with more than enough additional needles.  My only knock would be that all those needles have no place to go once you have opened the packaging.  We put them in a ziplock, but it would be nice to have something to hold them together.The pump itself works well, no issues after using it for over a month, including my 6yr old son who always wants to pump up his soccer or basketball and is not as gentle as myself.

  If you're coaching a little league team and need a lot of practice balls, you cant go wrong with these.  I coach a 6-8yr old ""coach pitch"" team.  These are a great bang for your buck for practice balls.  In my opinion better than Rawlings' R100-UPY practice balls.  If you do the math, each ball is < $2.00 ea.; compare that to other baseballs unit costs.  We've lost a few balls, on average 6-10 balls per season.  Either from practice or a kid takes one home.  Replacing lost practice balls wont cost me $50 and up.  However I do use Rawlings RLLB balls for games.The feel is what you would expect out of a cheap ball - cheap.  Regardless, these are only meant for practices.  These balls are great during wet weather practices because they are resistant to excessive water log compared to any yarn wound baseball.  You don't get the pinging from bats with these, it's more of a ""POCK"" sound, and it doesn't leave the bat in a hurry like the RLLB balls.  Overall, the OLB3 balls perform well.

  These are batting practice baseballs.  They are perfect for that purpose.These are not intended for serious play.  The seams are flat and the cover is substandard.  But it's 12 balls for $20 so you can lose them or abuse them in batting practice without breaking the bank.UPDATE:  The price has gone up from $19.99 to $32 - the value definitely takes a hit at the higher price point.

  Just OK, but the price is low and may work for you if your goal is to to add practice balls without spending much $. However, my boy doesn't like hitting these because they come off the bat with a duller ""thud"" than most other balls and tend not to fly as far. That's OK, maybe it will make him swing harder, but I wouldn't buy them again. I'll stick to leather or other brands of balls with synthetic covers. I purchased these on Amazon and think work a little bit better (although leather is still better): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CIX9WA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

  Terrible balls. Yeah they're ""value"" but you're not saving enough to justify how bad they are. They came impressioned and misshapen just from shipping. Slippery, plastic feel with bad, flat stitching. Too plastic-y to toss with. Too poor of quality to hit with.Immediate return and deceptively labeled. ""Official league"" - no league I've ever heard of would use these balls. Just because they're stamped ""Rawlings"" doesn't mean they're the ball you're used to.

  I have been using these tees for a few years - I love these tees. I use the top of the blue field for my drive height, that provides me with a consistent height that I don't have to eyeball guess. I tee them down to just below the cup for irons if I can't find a short broken tee on the ground.. They are wooden and aren't indestructible but they seem to last longer than any other tee I've used. The price on Amazon is usually less than I can find them at the various golf stores in town. The free shipping makes buying them a no brainer. I try to keep one open bag of tees in my golf bag and one unopened in the trunk for reserve. I don't like the sound or feel of the click from plastic tees, so it's wooden for me all the way!

I wish I could give it 3.5 star but I had to choose whether 3 or 4 so I gave it 4. not 3 star definitely..

  I've tried many different types of tees over the years, but I've never personally seen any huge boost in performance over standard wooden tees. But one thing I always struggled with was tee height. These tees cleared that right up. They also claim to have a lower profile which increases ball speed off the tee, but as I've not put that to the test in a simulator with numerical data to back it up I won't speak to that. Overall a good, sturdy tee, and decent bang for your buck for quality tees.

  Bought these for my friends birthday along with a new golf bag.  I tried one tee myself and it seemed as good as anything I had.  It's size worked for the driver (tee it higher)  on down - one size fits all.  I think one could use the stripe on the tee to adjust tee heights to what works best for the individual.  My tees are all solid colors so my next buy could be tees with stripes on them now that I think about it.

  Where do i start.  These are golf tees and their main purpose to be able to penetrate the tee box soil, and simultaneously hold a golf ball in place so you can swing and hit the ball.  I'm very pleased to report that these tees do both of those things, and DO IT WELL.  Will they work everytime?  I don't know.  I literally don't know anything about where you live, or the golf course that you play on.  Is your soil made of sand?  Limestone?  Granite?  Maybe it won't work.  Do you have tons of WIND?  That could affect it too.  But I would be willing to guess these tee's would work for 99.9 percent of golfers and I'd put them up against almost any other tee's that are made the exact same way.  I think they're wood by the way.  But painted.

  Pride Professional Tee System, 3-1/4 inch ProLength Plus Tee are well worth considering. They are White with Blue bands that can guide your ball height ion the tee. All you have to do is determine the right height for you and for the different clubs you hit off the tee and remember which band works for your game. Then all you have to do is walk up and set your tee and place your ball to be hit. Excellent buy.

  I ordered these from another company and they never arrive. Amazon refunded me and I ordered again because they got such good reviews. They fit really well. I have a 3 and 6 year old and they work well for both of them. They occasionally get water in the lenses but it's usually after they cannonball!They are very easy to adjust and the double strap keeps them from sliding down. My kids also love the colors. Overall, I'm really happy I reordered these and would recommend them to friends.

  We have other goggles but these are the go-to for both my kiddos, ages 6 and 3. They love wearing them and put their faces in and dive as a result! They are comfortable and don't leak. They both get red rings around their eyes but don't seem bothered by them. Definitely recommend!

  I purchased these for our 3 and 6 year olds.The 6 year old has been attempting to get a lot of use out of them. However, the very first time I put them on her they almost immediately started fogging up. Annoying, but it didn't surprise me. The worst part is she is getting out of the pool about every 20 minutes and saying her goggles aren't sticking to her face anymore. So I'm constantly tightening them. I'm not sure why they're not staying tight. After awhile I see that the strap has slipped down the back of her head and are now folding her ears over and not long after that she's saying they're not sticking to her face.The 3 year old tried them on a few times, but doesn't have much interest in wearing them. They seem to fit him though, at least for the very short period of time he's wearing them. I'm sure he'll have the same problem she's having.I guess I'll just wait for these to break so I can try a different brand.

  Edit: dropped my rating down to a 3.  the goggles are fogging up so much now.  At first they didnt at all.  its may now and we got them in august and they are 9 months old and wish the fogging up wasnt an issue because we need to purchase more nowthese work just as well as the name brand similar item.  Its such a great value, we got 2 goggles for what I paid for 1 set with the other company.  My 4 year old has a blast at the pool diving and splashing with these.

  These stay on my 2 yr old better than her FINIS, but the eyes are set just a bit wider. They work but I have to pay attn to how they sit to make a seal. That said, it's well worth it to then NOT have to ADJUST the straps (and pull her hair) multiple times as the straps slip around. And once she's a tad bigger I won't even have to think about it. Great value. Will buy again.

  So these are great but my daughter has very long lashes and these are extremely shallow. Her lashes hit the glass and make it very uncomfortable for her. Compared to other goggles I thing they keep water out better but they are only half as deep as other brands.

  So they look like they're 2 different products, the blue one has the Omeril logo and it's not the best but does the job. However, the purple/pink has no logo on it and appears to be of a lower quality, the straps on it are very flimsy. It keeps falling off when my daughter is swimming constantly needing readjustment.They both do fog up alot.

  I bought the GoSports Indoor / Outdoor Ladder Toss Game Set because my family was complaining we did not have enough outdoor games for our 4th of July get-together.  Ladder Toss has long been one of my kids' favorite games so I decided to order this item from Amazon.  I have been very pleased with this purchase.The set is easy to assemble and durable.  These are a must for outdoor games.  If one tube breaks of a connector comes loose the entire game is worthless.  This set is solid.  We have used it all summer long.  It provides my adult kids and their friends with seemingly endless hours of entertainment.Set up is quick and easy ... takes less than two minutes to assemble.  The rubber bolos are attached to a sturdy nylon rope that shows no signs of fray or fatigue.  Throw the rubber bolos at the three tiered ladder and hope the rope catches so that the rubber balls become entwined on a rung of the ladder.  That's how you score points.  Sounds easy ... takes some skill ... always a fun game that EVERYONE can play.  Also, makes for a great drinking game ... but is definitely fun for the whole family whether drinking alcohol, water or juice.We have owned a few ladder toss sets over the years.  The others ultimately succumbed to use and abuse.  This set feels much more substantial than any set we have previously owned.  We have gotten an entire summer's worth of fun out of it and I have high hopes that it will last for several seasons more.I am very pleased with my purchase of the GoSports Indoor / Outdoor Ladder Toss Game Set.  Five stars.  If you find this review helpful please click the ""Helpful"" button below.

  I purchased this product to use at our wedding reception as we were having a few yard games. Everyone loved it! Recently when we were using the game, a player had lost their balance and stepped on one of the games, breaking a few pieces. I contacted GoSports to see if I could get replacement parts. Their customer service is amazing! They responded to each email in a very timely manner, and sent replacement parts out in no time, coming in the very next day of being shipped. After receiving the replacement parts, one of the bars did not fit properly with some of the original parts. Not looking for anything more, I contacted GoSports to see if they had any suggestions on how to make the pieces fit. Instead of sending out a new part again, GoSports actually replaced the entire set!! And again, was delivered the very next day! I cannot thank GoSports enough for their amazing customer service and for standing by their product. Thank you!

  Great quality and very durable cloth tape. Hard to find a tape that‚Äôll actually keep bandages and rolled gauze in place sometimes. This tape & adhesive is the best I‚Äôve used, no more wasting money trying other brands and styles . Width of tape, and ability to tear without scissors are a huge plus.

  This is 3M's most adhesive tape, and although it performs pretty well in the dry, it does not perform well enough when damp such as from sweating.  However it is stickier than McKesson surgical silk cloth tape and MUCH stickier than the Band Aid and Rite Aid cloth tapes that you get from the Pharmacy (yes, we have tried a few!).  For blister prevention, Leukotape is still the best - not only is it sticky, it keeps sticking when wet, and the fabric weave is much tighter and thicker providing better protection.

  First this tape is excellent, have no problem with its performance but to answer one question it doesn‚Äôt stretch. Tough fabric type tape. Problem is you won‚Äôt get the 24 2‚Äù rolls as advertised. Ordered 3 times from 2 different sellers, this one two times. All three times came in as one single roll. (Although paperwork clearly stating I was receiving 24 rolls) Dealt with customer service each time (ask for supervisor to not waste extra time because others can‚Äôt comprehend issue). Supervisor Jeff nice, tried to fix issue, even gave $5 credit for my trouble. Said it was a stocking problem after second time and told to buy from another listed seller. It came in as a single roll again instead of 24. Didn‚Äôt bother wasting another hour calling a fourth time because they have a bigger problem than they realize no Would be an excellent deal if you received actual 24 rolls but not for just 1 roll. Also, this isn‚Äôt only item I‚Äôve had this exact same problem. Used to love Amazon, still order a lot ,but don‚Äôt depend on receiving what I order any more. (When tape came in wrong third time my husband wasn‚Äôt going to show me package to save me from aggravation; it was obvious each time that 24 rolls couldn‚Äôt be in such a small package)

  Many bandage adhesives cause my skin to break out in a rash.  I am not allergic to latex, it is the adhesive.  This stuff works fine for me.  It adheres well; in fact, still adheres well when you want to remove it.  Can live with that.On the inside of the spool, it says 3M Durapore, which is the commercial customer name of the product.  Nexcare is the retail customer product line from 3M.

  This is a much appreciated item when you have a daily need to change wound dressings and the whole area is swollen and tender to the touch.  It will wrap around gauze, pads, but the adhesive is not very tacky, so it needs more tape than I would prefer.  It also doesn't tear easily, so I must use scissors to cut the strips as the end of anything you try to tear off will be frayed and not stick to anything else.  I knocked off a star for those two points, but it is worth the money to not cause further damage to my healing ankle wound.  Best of all, it never hurts when I have to change the dressing again each day.  Used this for a week, and now it's almost healed and no longer painful to the touch.  I'd buy it again and will keep this in my emergency medical bag for the next time.If my review was helpful to you, please let me know by checking the box below.  Thanks!

  I plan to add a about a foot of this tape to a first aid kit for homeless people along with a few other items, like triple Antibiotic ointment, a few small gauze pads and band aids. This is the same tape hospitals use. There is a plastic tape which is okay but I found this can hold up for two days but on a fresh cut or fresh wound you need to LOOK at it after one day if not sooner. Gets dirty quickly but if you care for a cut properly, it will be on the mend quickly. This tape plus a small gauze pad and some triple antibiotic ointment should do all the work for you. Toes and feet need attention daily to prevent gangrene (AHH amputation). I should know , I almost lost a toe due to infection. The podiatrist said it smelled like a deer dead for three days, but he saved it. There is paper tape but that's only for a phlebotomist who draws your blood and puts a gauze pad on with paper tape. Buy this tape as it belongs in every home first aid kit.

  Value - yes, good value.Performance - Currently, I'm a bit disappointed in this product as I'm dealing with torn skin as a result of using this product.  Is it adhesive, yes, very... maybe too strong for sensitive areas.  Also, not very tearable - transpore tape is tearable, this cloth first aid tape is not.Think it's fine to use on thicker skinned areas, but again, I'm writing this while dealing with sore, exposed skin area from tape removal (and yes, I was very slow in the removal process which was probably even more painful!)  Thank goodness it was only one strip and not all 4 strips that tore skin off :(

  ¬†Okay, so I'm not in as good of shape as I used to be. I used to work out regularly and I was pretty fit. Additionally, I have noticed my coordination and balance slowly degrade as I get older. I think jumping rope will help with all of the above.I used to work out with a speed rope many years ago so I decided to get one again. This one looked decent and was cheap, but not too cheap. I really liked that is has ball bearings to keep it from getting twisted. That used to get very annoying during long sprints.The handles are plastic and foam which is not really a bad thing. It keeps the handles extremely light while also feeling pretty solid. At times, I almost forget I have anything in my hands at all. The length of the rope is just right for me. I am just a hair under six feet tall. I was able to immediately get a good rhythm going without having to stoop over to get the rope under me. I was doing double unders within the first couple of minutes. The ball bearings work very well.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would buy again.

  I am considerably older than the last time I jumped rope.  I'm in a warmer climate and and take my exercise outside now.  The grips are easy to hold even with my arthritis.  The rope is plastic so there is no problem to skip rope in the rain.  The rope is thinner than the old fashion cloth clothesline type which means I don't have to get my big behind higher up in the air.  I know the difference is minuscule but when you are jumping up and down and are obese, every fraction of an inch is important.  My only complaint is that the rope is very long and it drags longer on the floor.  I wish they came in sizes.  I suppose it might be better to drag 12"" of rope on the floor instead of 2""; that would be less higher I have to jump.  In any case, I am keeping this rope and expect to lose a lot of calories using it in my back yard.

  Full disclosure - I got this for free to do a review.  I said I would be honest - if it was bad, I would let them know first and then print the review.I already had a ""speed rope"", which I bought for a bit more than this.  That one was cheaply made - basically a thin plastic tube that was VERY lightweight and not much use.  This, however, is surprisingly heavy duty.  It's a snap to adjust the length (unscrew the top of the handle and there's a pushdown adjuster).  I routinely used jumpropes at my dojo, and this compares favorably to those - at less than half the price.Highly recommended, and THIS is the rope I will throw in my suitcase when I travel.

  I bought these to add a little variety(jump roping) to my fitness routine.  I couldve just used good ole rope but thought Id see if a ""real"" jump rope would be better.  It is.  These arent really all that fancy but Im not sure you can make a fancy jump rope.  On the other hand, the hand grips are hollow which allowed me to fill mine with sand to make them heavier and add a little resistance to my work out.  So far these seem pretty durable as well.  I cant really use mine in my apartment because Ill disturb the people living downstairs so I take them outside on a dirt drive.  Using them on the dirt drive hasnt seemed to hurt them at all.  So for my needs, this jump rope is working out well.

  The reviews for this deck have been going on for a while. Reading through some of them before and after buying this product I found many of them to be untrue.The cards I received do not have paint that ""bubbles"" or scratches off; no negative marks there.The look of the cards is pretty cool. Each individual card is a little bit 'glossy', not fully transparent. If you fan the deck in a smooth way you see a cool 'infinity-mirror' affect. The box reminds me a little bit too much of 90s pencil holders.I do agree with a review I read that it would be nice if these cards had the tiniest bit of noticable texture, especially when wet.The worst thing in my experience: card flicking. I have a friend who can stick traditional cards into some suprising surfaces with just a flick of a wrist. I have always been jealous of his skills. Upon receiving these cards, I start to flick them at the wall. One of them shatters. :(Not the intended use of a card... so you have trade offs. Regular cards can be ruined by improper use just as easy as these cards can (as of this review).Final review: cool product, material is no worse than standard cards but has potential.

  These cards are already the hit of the summer!  For $6, we have had so much fun, the kids are rocking their math and are getting a boatload of exercise.Here are the two main ways we use them:1Ô∏è‚É£ Throw some in the pool (they will sink unless sitting perfectly on top of the water) and have a race to get 10 hearts, all even numbers, numbers divisible by 3, etc.2Ô∏è‚É£Throw only the numbered cards (2-10) into the pool (you can do all numbered or only red or black, for example) and then have the kids race to bring back cards which make an equation to make a certain number.  The kids absolutely love this!!!  We also make rules like: - your equation must be at least 3, 4 or 5 cards - we exclude the 10s - we exclude ""double digits""...  meaning you can only get one of each number.  No 2x2, for example - If I'm feeling like a softie, we'll even include the Aces to use as ones. But that makes it soooo much easier so beware! - We throw in more or less cards.  We tend to do one suit per person playing but including more would make it easier to find that one card you are looking forI love how you can tailor this to your child's level.  It has been so fun to see the equations they come back with.  They literally beg for us to do this and I love how they are working on quick math recall....  and simple equations!The ink on the cards is starting to wear off in some places  but we've already used them so much we don't even care.  They have been well worth the price for what we've used them for.  Cheaper than a math workbook and much more fun!As other reviewers have already stated, they are stiff when right out of the package but they do loosen up and become easier to play with outside of the water.  Just realize these are more plastic than paper so will feel different than traditional playing cards.

  Hoyle, if you're reading this--do two things: add a texture to the cards so they're not so slippery, and make the case slightly taller so the whole deck can sit in the ""well"" while playing or taking a break. These cards look good (but not great, a little cheap looking) but I've gotten similar or better cards for less $. Was hoping the brand-name would bring higher quality.

  I do not recommend - the print on the cards scratch off within the first use. The cards would be perfect if the print was laminated to eliminate scratching.  The cards also stick together once wet which makes shuffling a hard task but that's a fair sacrifice for being able to play card games in the pool.  The case is not perforated so the cards need to dry before you put them away.

  We like these cards, they are able to be used outdoors, in the pool, or inside.  They wash up well, and aren't ruined if you get greasy fingerprints on them during a picnic or while eating.  They are very reasonably priced, however, it takes some getting used to shuffling without spraying cards all over the table (it is good for a few laughs though)!  They are somewhat slippery holding them, especially if you have a lot (10+) in your hand and they slide around in the card holders we have.  Not sure if that is the cards' fault or the holder design.Overall, for the price they are not a bad purchase.  To be honest, we have others, somewhat textured, that we like better.But the design is very fun, and different.

  I got these for some messy/water games we were playing. They worked well. Some of the images have developped ‚Äúscratches,‚Äù but they are still usable and would be unlikely to receive such rough treatment in a regular game of cards. Extensive play may not be a good fit for this deck, but I would expect that intermittent play should be fine: with no worries about  moisture or spills!They are a bit trickier to shuffle, but nothing you can‚Äôt handle.

  My husband and I play cards together often and these are the best cards I've ever owned.  They are waterproof so even if we spill something they can just be washed off.  The are pretty indestructible and will always stay crisp and not have bended corners like other cards that have been used a lot.  They are plyable enough to make it easy for my klutzy husband to shuffle.  And for me that is the best part.  Even after bending sharply to shuffle the cards evenly  and easily they go right back to their shape.  They can be a bit slippery but that is not a deal breaker.  The numbers are a good size to see clearly.  I have two decks of these cards and I do wish they came in two different colors to make separating them easier.

  These Adidas white socks have given me more happiness in my life than any other thing in this world could. They have comfortably fit onto my skinny, brown feet for a few weeks now, and I can guarantee you that my feet have never felt more secure and relaxed while serving McChickens to my lovely customers. 10/10 recommend these puppies for all people of all shapes and sizes.

  I wear a 13 wide shoe, and normally have to buy the longer version of socks or else they are too short and tight.  It's been tough to find quality athletic or heavy duty socks in long length.  I had been happy with gold toe white socks, and a few months ago I purchased black gold too in extended length. Gold Toe Men's Cotton Crew 656s - but they wore out, and got holes in the heel area after just a few months of use.  So, I though I would order these Adidas as they come in extended length and had good reviews.  I have only worn them for a few weeks, but they are not very ""athletic"" and they are not very ""cushioned"".  They are more like a normal ""dress socks"" - I can see my skin showing thru them, and they don't have any additional cushioning in heel or toe.  I purchased extended size and the length is good, but they are very tight... I have to do a little work to get them to pull up over toes, and they feel tight around my ankles and lower calves.  Also, the small plastic tabs that hold the pairs together are a pain to cut without nicking the cloth material.  I am still looking for good heavy duty cushioned socks in extended length size that fit well too and last for more than a few months.

  The socks are comfortable enough.  But they are very poor quality. When I took them off after wearing them for 1 day, I was shocked to see that they had already pilled on the bottom and threads were coming loose. I was just walking around the mall in my running shoes -- nothing very demanding.  I also found that that fit quite large.  It is too bad that I did not try them out before the Amazon return deadline. I assumed they were up to Adidas quality standards and did not open the package. I don't know if these are fakes or if Adidas quality has slipped that much. I have other socks I have worn for years.

  These socks looked good in the photo but they are pure trash.  The foot section is way too long and the leg portion is way too tight.  The material is super thin as well.  Perhaps, if you have a very long foot, (size 12 maybe), and a very skinny calf, plus you like an extremely thin fabricl, these socks would be perfect for you!  I've had Adidas socks before and never had a problem.  How they came up with such a long foot section and such a skinny leg section is beyond me.  Do yourself a favor and avoid these socks at all costs.  Good luck!

  I bought these socks, because the description was identical, as was the material composition, to Adidas socks bought in a local sporting goods store.  These socks are significantly thinner.  Next time, I will purchase at a local store to make sure the material is the same comfortable thickness as my original package.

  Update:After wearing them for awhile I noticed that they're all slightly different in length. It's weird. No sock matches another in length....it's annoying some are shorter some are longer. They were all supposed to be one length....Original review :These socks are great, I would like them to be a little tighter on the calf, as they tend to slid down throughout the day.  I recommend these socks!

  I wish manufacturers wouldn‚Äôt get consumers hooked on their products and then quietly and surreptitiously change the quality, but that is what happened here.  These socks are not the same quality they used to be.  I still have the older version and it is clear when looking at each side by side that Adidas is trying to save some money on material.  This new version is practically shear on the top.  I can see my feet through the sock!  Will not buy again.

  Shipping - arrived as promised in appropriate packagingProduct itself - purchased black socks in men‚Äôs size my son wears.  They fit as expected.Quality is the reason for a low score.  My son and I both put on a new pair, each of us had one of the socks rip.  These socks had not been worn and clearly should not have ripped upon simply putting it on.  We‚Äôve work Adidas brand many times and have never seen such cheap quality.  I suspect these are not true adidas socks.

  This tape, I don't even know where to begin!  My seamstress Diane introduced me to this tape to help eliminate back fat from my strapless dress along with that annoying bunch at the underarms.  It works and its amazing!!!  Every bride needs to know this trick.  You take the tape and, making sure that the first end doesn't extend above your dress line, you attach it to your problem area.  Then pull the tape downwards and/or out, depending on how you want the skin to smooth.  As you pull, press the tape onto your skin and smooth it down.  Like a charm!  I loved this dress but I was dismayed to see my rear reflection when I first tried it on.  Because of that I almost didn't choose it.  I read that the proper seamstress can cut the dress in a way to reduce the appearance of back fat, but this tape did that and allowed the dress to be nice and snug, without any weird alterations.  I had the tape on for several hours after each fitting and all day/night for my wedding.  I never felt it and it didn't rip out my hair when I went to take it off.  They should honestly market this tape specifically to the wedding industry and offer it in a variety of skin tones.  A large part of me feeling stunning in my dress and totally self confident was because of the way that this tape worked.  Thank you seems insufficient.

  We usually purchase rock tape directly from our chiropractor however when we ran out I figured I would just have some shipped to me so I ordered off amazon. I purchased the beige skin color tape and it‚Äôs much thinner and not as durable as what we usually use. It‚Äôs strange. It‚Äôs as if I bought a knockoff even though it‚Äôs says ‚ÄúRock Tape‚Äù inbthe packagr and roll! It does not perform the same either. It felt more like KT tape. I definitely will not buy again.

  I separated my shoulder forty years ago, when kidnapped in Mexico.  I punched a couple guys to escape. Shoulder popped out and was hanging behind my head.The same shoulder was dislocated when my UPS shirt, hooked onto door handle and I hung outside the truck until I took my ink pen to tear the shirt.Shoulder weak now at 60.  My chiropractor recommended Rock Tape.  He put it on me at his office.  Three days later, I love this tape.My shoulder is weak. I can dislocate it in my sleep.  The tape holds my shoulder up. Giving muscles and tendons a rest.  I can still mountain bike 30 miles a day. I can still walk and kayak.Just ordered more. In bulk.

  This tape seems to be quality made, stretchy and supportive. HOWEVER this is for people out there who are super sensitive to EVERYTHING like me. I know it says hypoallergenic and blahblahblah but this made my skin break out in a rash and ended up with blood blisters within hours that ended up scarring:/ No i did not wear it for more than a few hours and yes I was stupid enough to try it twice and it happened TWICE! But it‚Äôs just bc I have super sensitive skin and have an allergy to latex, adhesives, food allergies, environmental allergies, etc. I get rashes when I wear ANY kind of bandaids so I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised.

  I‚Äôve been PT for about 3 weeks. My trap muscle and neck are extremely inflamed and tense. I work in the healthcare field and this injury has been very painful.At every session they use Rock tape & rock sauce to alleviate some of the pain and it has been fantastic! I am extremely sensitive to medication so I‚Äôve had to deal with the pain in more natural ways.  The tape helps correct my posture as well. I decided to purchase some for home since I only see the PTA two times a week.My skin is also very sensitive but this has not caused any rash or irritation for me. It does hold up well in the shower but mine tends to become stretched out after sleeping. I toss and turn so  I‚Äôm sure the tape rubbing on the sheets causes this.Honestly this has brought me the most relief out of all of my treatments and I highly recommend it!

  I absolutely cannot believe how amazing this has worked on my aching joints & neck/back pain that I get due to an old injury. This stuff is for real! I'm nearly 53 years old and have put my body through a lot lately with remodeling & my knees were hurting so much as well as my back and neck. I'm in pretty good shape and work out, but I guess I pushed my body to the limit so when my physical therapist put this on a recent injury site (because of muscle spasms), it worked so well on alleviating those daily muscle spasms, so I bought more to try on other aches and pains. I was shocked it actually helped and I was able to reduce my pain medicine. Ì†ΩÌπå I love the chart that is included on how to apply in different areas, too. I can't believey doctor never recommended this years ago for my neck/back injury. Glad my physical therapist introduced me to this tape.

  I've been dealing with unbearable pain on my left foot due to plantar fasciitis and Morton's neuroma for months. I was constantly stressed and anxious; I couldn't wear shoes other than sneakers, envied people around me who could wear their seasonal booties, and became afraid to do any outdoor activities that I normally love doing. Nothing seemed to work... I tried compression socks, massagers, custom orthotics, sturdy shoes, religiously stretching morning and night... still the pain was there.It wasn't until I started taping my foot daily that I felt any improvement and relief. A couple weeks of taping later- now my left foot has never felt better. It's incredible. I had my doubts, but this experience had converted me into a true believer.My only wish is that the tape was more water resistant than advertised. Unfortunately, the tape comes off every time I shower so I go through the roll pretty quickly. Still, it's brought me utter relief and I couldn't be more thankful.

  I was so excited to order this game for my kids after searching for fun outdoor activities. What a disappointment for all of us. The assembly is easy but getting the net tight is almost impossible. It has to be tight to bounce well but stretching the net into the loops is hard and it often breaks the string. When we finally got it set up we all went out to play and it terrible. Too difficult for the kids and not even fun for adults. Maybe you need lots of practice but we were just wanting a simple fun game. Once you slam the ball on the net it barely bounces off and is about impossible to return. We love outdoor sports but this was a let down. Also the frame is not stable and too get the net tight it bends the plastic.

  My 15-year-old and his friends were waiting by the door for this item to be delivered. The UPS man handed it over and they were playing it within five minutes.

  My husband and I LOVE this game. SO.MUCH.FUN!!! We played all week at a family reunion on one that was an off brand and the bounce was definitely not as good. So it does change the game a bit if you don't have a good quality one. If you are going to be too serious about this game or play it much at all, it's not worth getting a knock off version! This is definitely better.

  My son had purchased this and because our family loves it so much I purchased a second set.  We even brought both sets to a family reunion in California this week.  They will both fit into a roller carry on bag.  We have family members age 5 up to 59 playing this game.  It's easily portable and sets up quickly.  Only suggestion is to have a pump for the balls when they get soft.  You want to keep them firm for best performance. Airplane ride will cause them to lose a little pressure.It's not only fun and easy to play but you do get your heart pumping.

  The net is probably the worst thing about spike ball. It‚Äôs a cheap net, mine even had a couple spots where it was literally hanging by a thread right out of the box. It‚Äôs also weirdly uneven so that even as I followed the video for setup, which said to make sure tension was the same on all corners, I couldn‚Äôt get it to be even without hooking on the inner part of the net in some parts. The video specifically said to only hook the outer part of the net but the net itself isn‚Äôt a circle. Setting it up so the ball actually bounces off the net takes some trial and error rather than being a simple hook and go. Once you‚Äôve gotten the net set up how you like it, you‚Äôre better off leaving it there even though it‚Äôs supposed to be something you can pack up and put away or bring with you. Even if you leave the net attached, I doubt it will be long before one of those threads come undone just as mine were in the process of doing before I even could attach the net the first time. Perhaps if I get the pro version the net will be better, I‚Äôll look into that more.

  Nice simple package.  A bit cumbersome to setup correctly.  It takes some practice to get the net stretched for the right bounce.  A lot of fun for the whole family once it's put together.  It's also pricey!  $30.00 would be a fair price for this.

  I do not typically write reviews for products. However, this product exceeded my expectations for the price I paid, less than 20 bucks! I will share what I liked about the product. Moreover, also how I think it could be better.So I bought this ab roller to work on my core while at home and workplace. The product arrived as accurately described with the extra knee pad and the two free ebooks (they emailed me the e-books). I have been using it for a few days, and it is destroying my core lol. Anyway, the below are the pros and cons about this ab rollerPROS- Very sturdy and high-quality ab roller. You can tell that it is made from very high-quality material.- the grips were very thick (see pictures) compared to the rod inside the roller, and I did not feel any pain in my hands after using it for 20+ reps- Love the fact that it came with the free knee pad! I have hard flooring at home, so the knee pad is a life saver for my knees! Also, the back of the knee pad has a sort of textured patterns to help with the grip- The two bonus ebooks are a very nice touch. One is on what to eat to get abs and the other on other workouts for abs. They are pretty long so I will need more time to go through both before I can rate how good they areCONS- The e-books were sent to me by email, and it went straight into my spam inbox. Had to dig around to find them- This is just a personal preference, but I would have preferred to have a color option aside from a black ab wheel. However, I guess it is not a big deal for some peopleI would say though if you are a beginner - I would ease into the motion of rolling forward because it can be a little bit challenging. My girlfriend has never used an ab roller before, and she wobbled a little with her first try. But after about ten mins or so, she was able to stabilize herself when rolling it forward completely.So I think for a beginner, once you get the motion of rolling forward while being able to stabilize the ab roller‚Ä¶ then you will hit your core pretty hard with this ab roller. Even for an intermediate and advanced user, this ab roller will give your six pack a good workout. This is not the first time I have bought a product from this company. So I have come to expect their high quality of customer services. Moreover, the fact you get a knee pad and two free e-books on nutrition and abs workout - this product is an absolute steal!!

  Good wheel. Seems hefty. The rubber edge seems very good and sturdy and can be used on all kinds of flooring. The bar that you hold into is sturdy and the grips are nice and soft... But not too soft. The reason for the 1 star shortfall is because the only thing holding the wheel on is the grips. So they can somewhat move off a bit as you see in the pics. Not so sure how others hold the wheel on but on this if the grips go bad there's nothing to hold it centered. Just fyi.

  This ab wheel is really nice.  I scoured Amazon for a wheel that didn't look flimsy and this thing seems really solid.  Very happy with this purchase!Pros:  I was worried it would be difficult to assemble as workout equipment can be sometimes, but it was crazy easy!You just slip the wheel and one handle on and you're done.  Took 5 seconds.  The wheel itself is a great width.  Other wheels seem like the 'tire' is harder plastic.  This 'tire' is very rubberized making it really non-slip on any surface.  I also like that the 'tire' is wider and had slightly rounded edges making it really stable when you working towards the side or bending at an angle for hitting your obliques.  Rolls very easily on any surface while still feeling really solid.  I've tried other ab wheels which just seem kind of flimsy, like the wheel moves side to side to much, and it makes for an unnerving exercise.  This one has no flimsiness when moving to the side.  I find it best to use on a large yoga mat though in case you fall on your face, ha!  The grip is comfortable enough.Cons: The only thing I think they could improve about the ab wheel is making the grip uniform squishiness throughout.  Maybe that's actually to allow for more friction so you don't slip, not sure.The extra knee pad seemed to slip on tile.  I tried it once and felt like my knees were going to slip out so I stopped using it.  Again, I just a yoga mat so my knees and the wheel stay on the same surface - I think that's important.Also, the e-books were a nice addition but honestly not very helpful if you know the basics about fitness.  I was expecting more alternative ab wheel workouts, but it's mainly general fitness tips and other ab exercises not using this wheel.  I have made up more ab wheel exercises up on my own just by changing up my knee positioning and the path of the wheel.  I'm getting nit-picky though, it might be helpful for some.Also, some of the workouts suggest that you do 5-10 minutes of ab wheel.  That's a crazy huge amount!  If you're doing in right, at the max intensity, you probably won't be able to do more than a minute. Watch some Youtube videos for proper technique.Overall, I'm very happy with this wheel and would definitely recommend it over others out there.One thing to note, I've seen this in the comments as a negative several times, ab wheels are not for everyone.  I consider myself to be at a fairly advanced fitness level and I can't do more than a handful of these in one set if I go down as far as I feel I can safely hold it.  If you're overweight, I think it'd be even harder.  You actually need a fair amount of shoulder stability in addition to keeping your core tight.  Makes for a great workout though if you can handle it!

  I started slow, not wanting to overdo, and I can quickly feel those abs being targeted. You feel the burn almost immediately, even with minimal extension. I would caution anyone who doesn't have an extensive workout routine to ease your way into this. If you try to do too much in the beginning, you'll overtax your muscles and, maybe, not want to continue. The wheel is fairly stable with its wide tread and, because it has a rubber coating, it doesn't slip. The grips are comfortable and seem to be sufficiently padded. Assembly is minimal and extremely simple. I haven't used the knee pad yet, but I think it will come in handy on hard surfaces. This one's a keeper. Washboard stomach, here I come. ;-)

  Didn't like these at all. The finish had a lot of imperfections on many, if not all, the golf balls. There were small protruding bumps one could rub their finger across. Gave mine away. I guess Calloway feels they just have to put their name on the ball and that's it.

  I play weekly, and have used every golf ball known to man and some women. in layman terms... the surface feels weird to newbies that are experienced with different coatings. It will feel almost rubbery or one guy even said ""spongy"" but dont let this mislead you. My typical drive is 290-315 with high end golf balls and this includes the SuperSoft. It is harder to slice/hook though not impossible to do. It will only reduce the amount of the spin on the ball, not get rid of it entirely. So try it have you havent yet. Its fun to drive, stick on the green, and put with.

  I am a plus size lady and was a bit worried this might not fit as I was a little over 30 weeks when I purchased this. I am so pleased to say it not only fits but helps me out SO much! I have had a surgery to correct my cervix and it caused my stomach muscles to weaken. Long story short after my c section (2nd pregnancy) it caused more sagging and pain with this pregnancy. When I got the maternity belt my world has literally changed! I wish I had been recommend to get one sooner as I am 31 weeks into my pregnancy now but the pain in my back feels like I'm only getting into the 20s! It is soft and very strong, so far I have not had an issue with the velcro coming undone while it's on. I have it on all the time unless I'm sleeping, it fits over my clothes which is a big plus for me so its easier to adjust if I need to. For anyone wanting to know a rough size comparison I was a size 20/22 before pregnancy and currently a size 26 comfortably. I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone including my fellow plus size moms. Ì†ΩÌ∏Å The picture shows no belt on top and with belt on the bottom. I hope this review helps you.

  I had horribly debilitating pelvic pain that started in my second trimester. It wasn't just soreness, but a burning right at front where everything connects (pubic symphysis). I had tried all of the home methods of managing that pain including wearing supportive shoes, trying to keep knees together when changing positions, keeping a pillow in between knees when sleeping, etc.After putting this on the first time, I felt relief within 2 minutes. I wear it outside in the heat and it is still very breathable. I also keep it on to sleep.Life Pro Tip: Bring it to an OB/Gyn appointment and talk to your doctor about how you are wearing it to be sure you are using it correctly. You don't want to have it tight, and you want to make sure you wear it low around your hips, not high on your bump like the picture shows.

  I started having premature labor at 29 weeks. Every time I stood up my uterus would get hard (contractions), and it would get worse and worse the longer I stood. I would pretty much have contractions anytime I did anything. I started wearing this at about 31 weeks after being on bed rest for 2 weeks. This helped prevent contractions significantly. The first day I wore it, I noticed I was able to stand for significantly longer without having contractions.This can be worn under any of my regular clothes. I would recommend a thin cotton shirt underneath if it is really hot outside, but other than that it is comfortable. For others out there having the same issue, things that I have found to be helpful: drink water ( Im drinking about 3L/day +other things), laying on my left side, acupuncture, hot herbal tea, hot liquids in general, and  coconut water. The hot liquids have been super helpful in making the contractions stop- wait until it is just hot enough to not burn and then drink the whole drink fast. Coconut water helped because it replenishes some of the electrolytes your muscles (uterus) needs after drinking so much water. Acupuncture helps for about 3 days, so I would suggest getting it right before a more active day. Hope this helps someone out there!

  This belt is has been an absolute life saver for me over the past two years and is the one item I don't think I could have easily lived through while carrying twins.While having my first daughter, I worked as a full time teacher at a preschool with one and two year olds. I was on my feet for 8 hours a day in a very busy classroom, lifting and carrying toddlers and spending a good deal of time getting up and down out of the floor. I did this from before the time I became pregnant until 37 weeks, which is when our beautiful little girl arrived.During that pregnancy, this maternity belt provided me with a great deal of relief. I often felt that my ab muscles needed more support with all of the lifting and frequently suffered from low back pain as the day (and my pregnancy) progressed. This band gave me that much needed support and allowed me to feel much safer lifting 25 pound babies all day.I credit the extra support provided by this band for preventing diastasis recti, as I feel that it aided holding everything together, but I have no proof of that.Prior to purchasing this belt, I was using the Shrinkx Hips belt (because I had it) and wearing it slightly higher on my hips (but lower in the front) to give my belly a slight boost. Although that did work temporarily, it did not provide me with all day comfort and it's lack of flexion concerned me in regards to my baby's safety. At around 4.5 months, I opted to try this band based on reviews and what I felt was a very reasonable price.The AzMed band's wide, curved, mesh-like front is highly conducive to a pregnant woman's growing belly and flexes easily to allow room for growth while also supplying gentle (but tangible) support. Basically, I could breathe and move very easily in this belt without feeling pressure against my belly. The long Velcro band made it quick and easy to adjust the support level throughout the day as well. Washing and drying this band with my regular laundry did not appear to impair its durability in any way. It was a good purchase.Fast forward 13 months. I am now days away from expecting twins, and my appreciation for this band has grown exponentially (like my belly). I began wearing it again at around 4.5-5 months (like last time) where I used it basically the same as before... low on my belly, higher on my hips, sometimes folding the front in half to provide double support and lift to boost my lower belly, which tends to endure the most strain. Once again, the belt allowed me to feel safe moving and lifting my own baby while also feeling supported. My second pregnancy, however, was nothing like my first and this band went from being nice to necessary very quickly.At 20 weeks, I was diagnosed with a (very) short cervix and put on bedrest.At the time, my daughter was 8 months old and there was no way around picking her up or carrying her while my husband was at work. I wore this band very snugly around my lower belly, hoping to raise it enough to take even the tiniest bit off pressure off to avoid further shortening. My doctors (a team of wonderfully Maternal Fetal Medicine experts) assured me that it would not prevent further shortening but did encourage me to use it for comfort or support. In all of my weekly ultrasounds to measure cervical length, I was asked to take the band off, so I have absolutely no way of knowing the impact of wearing this band, and whether it took pressure off from helping lift my belly or added pressure from squeezing enough to cause some downward pressure, but I often wondered. More than anything, I believe this belt provided me with a little psychological support in addition to abdominal support. It made me ""feel"" safer, despite that I have no proof that I was.At 20 weeks, they weren't sure we would reach 24, then 28, then 32.... we are now 36 weeks and the doctors are discussing inducing us at 38 (for the well being of the babies - this is routine with twin pregnancies due to rising risk factors).At 32 weeks, my abdomen was as big as it ever got with my daughter and at 35, it became very uncomfortable to move. Unlike with my first pregnancy, I have developed diastasis recti at the navel and a few fingertips below. My umbilical area is trying to herniate. I have developed hydronephrosis (basically I have a swollen kidney caused by internal pressure), and my pelvis pops with the slightest movement. Rolling over in the bed has gone from slightly uncomfortable to near impossible (without ab strength) and takes me a minimum of 10 minutes. The pain of having 40ish pounds of weight shift from one side of my uterus to the other is quite striking. Getting out of bed at all shifts the pressure so intensely that it often triggers contractions that leave me doubled over for several minutes before loosening enough to walk. But, the bottom line is, I am still pregnant after 16 weeks of cervical shortening, and that is something to celebrate. It is also something I would have been much more uncomfortable doing without this band.This band supports my abdominal muscles, especially the ones that separated between my navel and pubic bone (which stay the most sore), and decreases the pain of walking and rolling over. I still have difficulty and pain rolling over at night, but the band holds things together well enough that I can roll over in a reasonable amount of time compared with before, and without as much strain. Walking to my doctor's appointments (located way inside of a busy hospital) is much easier, as the pressure from gravity feels much less. The contractions triggered by shifting movements are practically nonexistent with this band, since it holds things in place, and I believe that alone has helped us reach 36 weeks.For women worried about these bands restricting their growth... I am no doctor, but was reassured by a team of MFM doctors in a teaching hospital that it was safe. I also had weekly BPPs and tri-weekly growth scans and despite the tendency of twins to drop centiles after 28 weeks (and my first daughter being born under 10 percent), the twins have remained 50th percentile and above throughout this pregnancy despite continuous wear. I realize this is anecdotal, so please always ask your own doctor first.One last note... this band is not for postpartum use and would be absolutely ineffective for use as a belly binder. It is not a flat band that sits flush against a non-pregnant woman's body, but is curved outward at the mesh-like area to allow space for pregnant bellies. After birth, despite swelling and normal postpartum... stuff... the curvature is too much to provide any support, even when worn tightly. Hospital binders, the Belly Bandit, the Squeem... etc. are much stronger and provide the compression needed to hold things in place. (I used the Belly Bandit immediately postpartum, later moved into the Squeem and Shrinkx Hips, which is another story, but having used all of these, I can assure you that the AzMed will not help with these postpartum issues if that is what you are looking for).

  I had mixed emotions about this based on how scattered the reviews are. But, it is WORTH BUYING! It is soft, and fits perfectly. Some people said it rides up but if you fit it on properly it wont. It offers amazing support and eased the pain in my back from scoliosis and my belly pulling my spine forward more. It is also not visible at all under clothing. I am only 20 weeks but this will be helpful my entire pregnancy.

  I ordered two sets of this card game and after using them for several months with dissatisfaction I contacted the SET Enterprises to voice my complaint.  The ""yellow star"" card is difficult to read.  The card stock is thin.  There is no comparison to the quality of my original set purchased at Barnes and Nobles.

  A group of friends and I used to play Skip-Bo, then one day we tried 5 Crowns. Never went back. We‚Äôve played 5 Crowns ever since. It‚Äôs a great rummy-style game.  We play with 3-6 players and it‚Äôs self-limiting on the time. There are 11 hands to a game and we usually finish in about an hour. Of course you can play more than one game if you like. We keep score but just laugh about the results - no pressure.

  While I don't usually like 'rummy-style' games, this game rates a 10 on my harsh scale.  It's rummy on steroids!Here's a tip that the manufacturer won't like me to share that will make your cards last 5-6 times longer.  After a hand is over, we put the used cards aside and just continue dealing from the unused cards.  People may complain that ""we used a lot of jokers (or the next wild card) already so we need to shuffle"" but after playing this way for years I can attest that it makes no difference at all because everyone is on equal footing.  I've challenged doubters to speak up if they notice one iota of difference in the play and I've had unanimous agreement that it made no difference.If playing two-handed, you'll only shuffle 3 times!  Once to begin, again after 8's are wild, and after either 11's or 12's (it varies).  3 times vs. 11 if you shuffle before every hand, greatly prolongs the life of the cards (even so, we've gone through about a dozen sets).

  A game doesn't get this many 5 star reviews without being a fun game to play... It is! So, I'm not going to talk at all about the fun we have playing it... I'm just going to dwell on the worst part of playing the game.It is a pain to shuffle all those cards! Split the deck in half and shuffle. Split the deck between everybody at the table and shuffle. Or (gasp!) just keep using the same deck for multiple games until you run out of cards. All have their downsides... Most notably, it takes a lot of time away from actually playing the game to fulfill the shuffling duties.My answer is to use an automatic (2 deck minimum) card shuffler. It speeds things along considerably; and it keeps folks that are ""shuffling challenged"" from running for the door! I found a hand cranked 2 deck model from CHH that works great. It ended up being a really cheap way to enjoy this game above its 5 stars rating for fun to play!An added bonus is it keeps the huge deck of cards in great shape. The cards don't develop that ""shuffled card bend.""But... you're still on your own for dealing.

  My 7 year old daughter fell in love with UNO after getting it as a Christmas gift and wanted to try some other card games.  Frankly, this is not one of her favorites of the 5 or so I bought her.  My thoughts are that this is because the game lacks a little pizzaz compared to some of the games really for kids (there aren't cute cartoon characters on the cards or anything), I think it is a bit hard for a 7 year old, and I think the keeping score over multiple hands doesn't appeal to the attention span of a 7 year old.I'm sure at this point your wondering why I gave this 5 stars?  Well, my wife and I actually really enjoy this game so while I debated 4 stars I decided to go with 5 for now (although see below about card quality).  This game is very similar to rummy but with a twist.  There are no 2s or Aces but there is a 5th suit and a lot of wild cards.  You basically play rummy starting with a 3 card hand, then 4 card hand, then 5 card and so on up to a 13 card hand.  You try to go out first.  If you don't you get one more turn to get rid of any 3+ card runs you have and those you can't lay, you get stuck with points (a low score is good) based on how high of a card you have.  At the end of the 13 card hand round, the lowest score wins.I like the game because a) you can play with two players and have fun-that seems to be pretty rare in card games in general and for me and my wife, it is a nice find b)I like rummy but find it a bit boring and this game jazzes up rummy enough to make it more interesting and c) it is not super complex and I find it relaxing to play (I will say in the 12 and 13 card hands it does get a little more complex mentally digesting all the card and possible runs you have, but it isn't bad).  It also moves fairly fast.  It takes us about 30 minutes to play through the 3-13 card hands.I will say, especially since I bought several card games at once and had something to compare to, I do not think these cards are very high quality.  They seem thin and don't have much of a sheen on them like they have that protective laquer type coating on them.  I wonder if they will wear well over time if we use them a lot.  One thing I do like is the game came in an appropriate sized box with a small tray for the cards in it.  A lot of these games come in much larger boxes than needed and still have no where to hold the cards and make the game harder to carry around to different households and store for no great reason.

  We love playing this game.  It is so easy and fairly quick.  And truly the game isn't over till the Kings Go Wild - though my mom (age 95) seems to win more often than any of us!  I got this for her for Christmas because we play it often, and she wants to play with her friends (they play cards once a week for hours at a time).  So, it's definitely for ages 8 - 99!!

  This is a fabulous card game, it's like rummy, but with 5 suits of cards instead of four.  The rules of the game are simple, and it's easy to pick up, yet the game is challenging, as each hand has a different wild card.  Starting with only 3 cards dealt, and 3's are wild, you play rounds up through kings (13 cards, kings are wild), and jokers are always wild.  The game moves quickly, and is addictive.  A person can be behind all game but still win in the final round.  This game was recommended to us and we are really glad we tried it.

  This tape, I don't even know where to begin!  My seamstress Diane introduced me to this tape to help eliminate back fat from my strapless dress along with that annoying bunch at the underarms.  It works and its amazing!!!  Every bride needs to know this trick.  You take the tape and, making sure that the first end doesn't extend above your dress line, you attach it to your problem area.  Then pull the tape downwards and/or out, depending on how you want the skin to smooth.  As you pull, press the tape onto your skin and smooth it down.  Like a charm!  I loved this dress but I was dismayed to see my rear reflection when I first tried it on.  Because of that I almost didn't choose it.  I read that the proper seamstress can cut the dress in a way to reduce the appearance of back fat, but this tape did that and allowed the dress to be nice and snug, without any weird alterations.  I had the tape on for several hours after each fitting and all day/night for my wedding.  I never felt it and it didn't rip out my hair when I went to take it off.  They should honestly market this tape specifically to the wedding industry and offer it in a variety of skin tones.  A large part of me feeling stunning in my dress and totally self confident was because of the way that this tape worked.  Thank you seems insufficient.

I'm nearly 53 years old and have put my body through a lot lately with remodeling & my knees were hurting so much as well as my back and neck. I'm in pretty good shape and work out, but I guess I pushed my body to the limit so when my physical therapist put this on a recent injury site (because of muscle spasms), it worked so well on alleviating those daily muscle spasms, so I bought more to try on other aches and pains. I was shocked it actually helped and I was able to reduce my pain medicine. Ì†ΩÌπå I love the chart that is included on how to apply in different areas, too.

  I've been dealing with unbearable pain on my left foot due to plantar fasciitis and Morton's neuroma for months. I was constantly stressed and anxious; I couldn't wear shoes other than sneakers, envied people around me who could wear their seasonal booties, and became afraid to do any outdoor activities that I normally love doing. Nothing seemed to work... I tried compression socks, massagers, custom orthotics, sturdy shoes, religiously stretching morning and night... still the pain was there.It wasn't until I started taping my foot daily that I felt any improvement and relief. A couple weeks of taping later- now my left foot has never felt better. It's incredible. I had my doubts, but this experience had converted me into a true believer.My only wish is that the tape was more water resistant than advertised. Unfortunately, the tape comes off every time I shower so I go through the roll pretty quickly. Still, it's brought me utter relief and I couldn't be more thankful.

  We purchased this putting green for my 7 year old son to practice on. The mat arrived rolled up in a large box that we saved for storage. The majority of the bottom has a non-slip grip so it stays put floors. The last 18"" of the green slowly inclines just over an inch. The mat easily unrolled and laid flat though there was an area of slight separation between the non-slip grip and incline foam padding that'll need to be re-glued.The putting green is slightly smaller than advertised. The company has it listed as being 9' x 3' however my mat is 8 feet 6.25 inches in length and 33.5"" at it's widest point. I imagine it was just easier to round up, but I thought it'd mention it either way.Other than that, I think this is a very nice, simple putting green and my son loves that he can pull his mat out and play golf whenever he feels like it.

  Outstanding putting mat, especially for the price. As us golfers know, putting typically makes up roughly 40% of all shots, so every stroke gained counts.  This mat is high quality, runs well, and has a sticky backing so it doesn't slide around on my tile floors. I love practicing my 5-9 foot putts as these can be VERY costly on the course.The only reason I rate this a 4/5 is because mine came a bit wrinkled on the top left side. Assuming yours is received without wrinkles it would be a perfect 5/5.Thank you for reading and rating my review!

  I'm a low handicap player and I've bought many practice aids before, always to be disappointed.  This is the best $35 I've ever spent on my game.  It's the perfect size to fit in my living room and roll some putts while I watch tv.  As some previous reviewers mentioned, I keep mine in the box it was shipped in.  I've had it about a month now and every time I pull it out, it always rolls perfectly flat.  The holes are the right size and I love the little upslope.  I would say this runs about a 10.5 on the stimpmeter, so it's a little faster than your average public course typically rolls, but it's definitely not Augusta (as I would imagine).  I use it on old hardwood floors and it provides extra slope to my putts, but the balls don't get stuck in the gaps on the boards.I've also recently gotten my 7 year old daughter into golf.  We have putting contests with this product and she absolutely loves it.  We both have fun coming up with creative putts to make the other hit.  Since I've had this, I've been trying to use it about 3 times per week and I've already seen a drop in my average number of putts.  This green is large enough to allow diagonal putts as well, so you're not always hitting the same putt every time.  If you're on the fence with this, go for it.  You'll be extremely pleased.

  Anyone who needs a true review from a real golfer, here it is.So easy to line up a putt and give yourself a true feel and a great line. I slapped down a chalk line for 6 foot putts. I wake up every morning and sink 5 in a row and go about my day. This has helped me soooooo much on the course. It‚Äôs made my short putts easy. The 1 star reviews here are jokes.  Before I buy anything on amazon I look at the reviews, especially the 1 stars too see what people have too say. But I went for it and this is a steal. My friend has a $200 set up and this exceeds it. It does the job and more. I have it set up on a wood floor and it rolls true.Buy it and learn the short ones. A 300 yard drive counts the same as made 6 foot putt.

  It's probably the worst product I have purchased through Amazon so far. I opened the box with no wrapping on the mat. It was too long for the box so the top part of mat was folded down . When I unrolled the mat , it is absolutely terrible . It was full of cat hair all over the mat both front and back not to mention the foam on the back was broken . It has been used in a house with cats playing on the mat all the time. I have tried to use roller to clean the hair but half way through I gave up because looking closely I saw cat hair is everywhere on the green part . I'm returning it. What a mistake .

  seems to be okay. about the same quality as the one my buddy paid $60 for. be careful your putter doesn‚Äôt have a bunch of dings/scratches on the bottom as it‚Äôll snag on this material. wish i could find one about double this length tho for a reasonable price.UPDATE!!!!so i bought this to try to practice enough to eliminate 3 putts, nothing is more frustrating than having birdie putts all day and ending up with bogeys. prior to this i shot below 80 maybe a dozen times in my life, 78 was my best round ever at easy courses. i‚Äôm 38 been playing since i was 12. member at a tough course for 2 years now. before this i typically shot mid to high 80s sometimes low 90s on a really rough day. after getting this and practicing i‚Äôve shot under 80 5 times this year and beat my best round with a 76!!! i bought a new putter too but i‚Äôm giving all the credit to practicing on this mat.

  I bought this as a git for my nephew, the mat itself looks great, however, it just comes in the shipping box, there's no item packaging or case.  So storage will seem to be an issue. You can try to reuse a the shipping box, but that isn't super convenient, nor does it look very attractive sitting in your house in a used cardboard box.  I ordered a yoga carrying sling in hopes that it will allow him to roll it up and keep it out of the way in a nice(er) way.

  These All-Health bandages are just right for the typical wounds I get on my elderly skin, either from bumping into something or from cat scratches, which require great care to avoid cellulitis.  The outside measurement is 3x4"" and the pad is 2x3"", and I also like the light weight, four-sided adhesion, and antibiotic protection.  I use Hibiclens Skin Cleanser and iodine on fresh wounds, and a touch of castor oil on the adhesive edges to make the bandages easier to remove, as they hold a good seal on my skin.  I think adhesion depends on skin type--young or old, oily or dry.  The four-sided adhesive stays put all day and also in bed so don't need extra protection at night.  Good news for sensitive skin: the bandage comes off more easily when wet.  The price is good as well compared to the better-known brands, and I see nothing sub-standard about them.

  This bandage has as the active antibacterial ingredient Benzalkonium Chloride 0.1%. Well, I guess my skin did not like this chemical.  When I took off the bandage after 24 hours, I was left with a huge red area the exact size of the bandage which is 3"" x 4"". It has been 3 days and it is still as red as can be and very tender to the touch. In areas it looks like blood is trapped below the surface of my skin. I see a Doc today.

  This turned out to be a terrible product for me. My skin reacted badly to something about it. Within about 30 hours (the second bandage) I began to feel significant pain. I removed the bandage and its entire shape was ‚Äúprinted‚Äù on my skin in a serious rash with broken skin over most of the area. It is now about 12 hours later and after cleaning it and applying cortisone, the rash has not improved much and still hurts quite a bit.  I have never had a problem like this from a bandaid before and I suggest it is not something you want to risk dealing with.

  Quite possibly the best bandage I've ever used. It's on the side of my knee, usually movement means adhesion will suffer, this bandage stays fully adhered through a full workout (pictures uploaded) and when it's time to take it off, it comes off without too much fuss.

  I've tried several different kinesiology tapes, here are the results of my head-to-head comparisons...In order of stretchiness:KT Tape Pro: Super stretchy spandex-type material. Dries super fast. Breathes excellently even in multiple layers.KT Tape: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape H2O: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape: Moderate-elastic content cotton. Takes the longest to dry but that's still fast. Not very breathable, can feel slightly stifling in multiple layers.In order of stickiness:Rocktape H2O: Can be repositioned, and will stick just as well after repositioning. Sticks to tape well. Can be uncomfortable to remove.Rocktape: Can be repositioned, but loses some stickiness each time. Edges tend to peel up. Doesn't stick to tape very well. Okay removal.KT Tape Pro: Can be repositioned, but won't stick for more than a day if you do.Sticks to tape well. Easily removed.KT Tape: Cannot be repositioned, edges tend to peel. Sticks to tape adequately well. Seems more painful to remove than others.In order of longevity:Rocktape H2O: 3+ days. Stays put until you take it off.KT Tape Pro: 2-4 days. Once you get it stuck on, it stays. Less peeling than Rocktape.Rocktape: 2-4 days. Edges tend to peel up on day 2, so you've got to trim it down.KT Tape: 1 day. Edges and entire parts of strips peel up almost immediately.In order of support:Rocktape: Very stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a lightly structured brace. Useful for areas where you need a lot of stability like knees and ankles.Rocktape H2O: Stable support.Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression brace. Useful for areas where you need both stretch and support, better adhesion and superior stretch offers excellent 'massage' for sore muscles.KT Tape: Moderately stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a compression sleeve.KT Tape Pro: Light to moderate support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression sleeve. Useful for areas where you need flexibility first, particularly well-suited to wrists and fingers.

  I never leave bad reviews. But the fact that this is a so-called ‚ÄúAmazon Choice,‚Äù is just ridiculous. So I‚Äôm going to tell you about this ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù KT tape with Amazon‚Äôs seal of approval.I frequently buy the authentic KT tape at CVS. (I‚Äôd call my husband addicted, but he wouldn‚Äôt.) So I stumble upon this product. Hmm, it would be so much more convenient and definitely cheaper, so I bought four rolls. The result is I have to return four rolls.While I have both versions in front of me, here‚Äôs the skinny: This tape is thinner and it feels different - the texture of the fabric is not as silky. This tape does not adhere for as long as or as well as the KT tape purchased at CVS. This tape tears pretty easily and by experience, I‚Äôve found that real KT tape is almost impossible to tear. And to round it all out, it gave my husband a slightly red, kinda itchy rash where the tape was applied and and for about a half-inch outline. (This condition generated a lot of complaints from him, but cleared up with a benadryl plus a nap.)So buyer beware! Don‚Äôt end up like me - at the post office.

  The product description clearly states KT Tape Original...It was an Amazon Warehouse item and the box would be torn but the product inside unaffected. Well as you can see in the picture, it's a KT tape original box but the tape itself is a very very cheap imitation. Additionally, the product was listed as 20 pre cut strips, I received a continuous roll of crap. Before I decided to the product, I gave it a try in hope that it would be comparable to KTTape. Far far from it. Absolutely useless. I have been using therapeutic sports tape for years, There are plenty of brands beside KT which are of good quality including store brands. What I recieved from Amazon Warehouse is best described as cheap imitation chinese junk. Not worth the $5.00 I paid for sure!As a side note, a friend of mine had the exact same experience with this product switcheroo by Amazon. I cannot be bothered to waste my time and energy returning this item. Very disappointed. I feel duped.I order many items from Amazon but this experience is changing my opinion of the company.It would be nice to hear from Amazon and get their side of the story.

  If you're looking for a novelty for an evening beach party or something of the kind this will be okay. If you have a toddler that loves to bounce around a ball everyday for a bit this isn't the best option. Blow it up tight and in 24 hours of sitting there doing nothing it will be limp and have to blow more air into it... The last ball we had from a different manufacturer lasted for over a year of regular use and only needed air with temp changes. I wish there was a BIFL option that would work for us. There is 1 out there but it's too heavy for indoor use. Best option is to buy something that will last as long as possible.

  Quality issues. I ordered beach balls of different sizes from different vendors. These are the worst. The plastic is thin and the seams are bonded poorly. The ball has little ripples and and deformities when inflated. It's not nice and smooth and round like other beach balls. 2 of the 3 I received also immediately started leaking. The kids were disappointed because 20"" is the perfect size for tossing around and playing.

  Headline sounds off based for a beach ball review.......I know.  But let me explain.  We have had a lot of cold rainy days this winter.  Our 3 year old grandson has been ""stuck"" inside as have we.  He loves to throw balls but being 3 his aim isn't always the greatest.....especially when he's throwing my yoga ball which had become the ball of his choice because of the size.  As you can imagine, a large yoga ball can knock many things over in it's path.  Of particular concern to me were my lamps - which I have had for a long time, weren't cheap, and I adore them.  In an effort to keep my possessions in tact, but still indulge his desire to throw a ball inside, I began looking for alternatives.  Of course Amazon had the answer.  We ordered these beach balls - which came in a set of three.  They are nice and light - almost fluffy if you will - and very bouncy.  They easily bounce off of everything.  He loves them and they are fun to play with - even for adults.  If these bite the dust we will surely order the same ones again.

  The pack came with three balls that were 12 inches, not 20 inches as advertised. One leaked air right out of the package and I couldn't use it. One lasted a day and then split at the seam. The last one lasted a few days before it split. The previous beach ball I used for over a month and eventually was punctured by a tree branch, so I don't think it's my fault here for being too rough with them.

  These are just what beach balls are supposed to be. They are colorful and fun to play with. My husband tried blowing one up, but it was too difficult so he used a small hand pump to inflate it.It‚Äôs nice to get 3 in a pack in case one goes flat.

  My son always loves to play traditional Monopoly since he was five. But the traditional Monopoly takes too much time to play and have too many pieces (a lot of different dollar bills, green color houses, red color hotels, etc), the rest of family (parents, uncles and aunts) all hesitate to play with him. It takes forever to play Monopoly and have tons of things to take care of.Now, I found this Monopoly Deal Family Card game and can't believe how much fun this game is within around 15 minutes for a round. This is such a great design to combine strategy, luck and excitement for school age kids and grown up together. My son just turns 9 years old and loves to play the set because he can think about different strategies to try to make the wining sets. Now the grown up also have tons of fun because this game makes you think also provides lots of surprise. The only huge bonus is you can bring this card game to any place easily since it eliminate all the paper money and lots of pieces. The price is really inexpensive. I will buy this game as gifts to all my son's friends for them to play with their families. This is how much I love this game! Highly recommend!

  No words can describe how grateful I am to have bought this game. For the last few years it's been incredibly difficult getting our family of four together and happy, even during holidays. Yesterday night for Christmas I pulled out monopoly deal and for the first time in ages ALL 4 of us wanted to stay in the same room for more than the usual! We laughed, laugh-cried, and played almost 15  ""one more round""s (hah!). It's super fun and easy to learn. Even my mom who doesn't know english well was able to catch on, and she ENJOYED it too (she usually despises games). Dad wasn't retreating to man cave, and little brother wasn't grumpy or rushing to see friends. Everyone wanted to keep playing and conspire over who to kill next. If you ever want to see mid-20 and mid-50 year olds acting like children again, this is the perfect game for you. I am SO GLAD I bought this game.

  Wish I'd thought up a pyramid -marketing scheme related to this - I'd be rich!!! I've introduced a bunch of family and friends to this and they introduced it to others!  It's spreading!Love this game! It's easy to play- but certainly best if players are at least 9/10 years old coz it's not a typical board game. Rules sound a but off to read but the first time you play it , you'll get it all figured out.It's a lot of fun and very, very addictive. You can start doing variations after a year of playing it to mix it up but it's still fun. I've had to but multiple packs because I either end up giving it away or wearing out my deck!Get it! Now!

  This is one of my favorite gamesWhen we play with new people we always caution the the first round will be more of a learning round, but it's really easy to pick up.You can play with up to five players, which we have done before, but I think it's a little much and I find the center deck depletes pretty quickly. I think four players is the sweet spot. We've also been thinking about adding another deck and seeing how that will playWe recently took an international trip and brought this along to play in the airport while we were waiting around and it was greatAs another reviewer mentioned, there are some scenarios that are not explained in the rules - for instance, we weren't sure if a ""just say no"" card could be played against another ""just say no card"", to settle it we ended up emailing Hasbro and to our surprise they emailed us back pretty quickly with the answer! (according to Hasbro, you can use a ""just so no"" card against another"")You can definitely play a round in 15 minutes, but we've had some rounds that have lasted a little longer. Overall it's a really enjoyable game and we spend most of the time laughing while we play

  When I bought the Monopoly Card Game it was because friends had it and had taught us to play it. We thought it would be a great game to have in our camper. So here it is March and pulled it out to play for the very first time. Tore the wipers off had our friends here to play. When we did things started to look funny. There was not a set of any of the properties. We got things like 2 electric companies but no water works, or 4 railroad cards but 2 different railroads not 4. And so on. Please advise what can be done about the problem. Check the pictures I sent.  Thank You, Sue Ruggles

  Whenever I suggest teaching Monopoly Deal to a new group of people, they expect it to be similar to the board game. But it's definitely not! This card game is awesome. It requires a bit of strategy and a bit of luck. It's fast-paced and sometimes frustrating, but it's always a good time. Super high replayability so it never gets stale or boring like its board game predecessor. Overall, five stars. Highly recommend.

  When you find a good product, you stick with it.........and I've been using this here in Arizona,land of all the harmful UV rays that just love to dry out rubber and plastic and make life miserableon your car or boat.  I have even used it on our shade cloth screens we have on our windows torefreshen the faded look to almost new.  Any car with a sunroof/moonroof needs this product.The rubber seals and gaskets just bake and cook and all rubber has oils in it.  303 blocks the UVrays and penetrates the rubber pores.  My wife has a 2003 Honda Accord with a sunroof and therubber seal around the edge stiil looks factory new.  I use it on tires and interior plastic and aroundglass on any rubber I can find.  And it DOES NOT leave that nasty shiney oily look and feel like someother products.  My wife's Honda is a testament to the product and being a user for over 15 years,I stand by it.

  I gave 3 stars since it restored faded plastic to a nice rich color, but removed 2 stars since it seemed to rinse off immediately after rain, defeating the purpose.I bought this initially for my car, to keep the interior panels looking like new and UV protected, as well as to use on some outer trim to preserve the black color.I first decided to try using it to restore some faded outdoor plastic furniture - you can see from my photos that it did a great job making the faded vinyl look like new. This formula isn‚Äôt sticky, greasy, or waxy - as long as you don‚Äôt use too much, it‚Äôs dry to the touch pretty much immediately. I also appreciate that it has virtually no fragrance. I sprayed directly on the chairs, sprayed a bit on a microfiber cloth, and then wiped it in. If you use a bit too much and it starts to look shiny, you can simply use a dry microfiber to buff some of it off. In smaller spaces where you‚Äôre worried about over-spay, I would spray it onto a cloth only rather than the surface itself. I was highly impressed, and wiped down all chairs, a table set, and our vinyl door. They all ended up looking brand new‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Until the next morning. It rained just a little bit overnight for an hour or two, and I went out to find that the chairs, which had looked brand new the afternoon prior, were back to looking faded and now also had a spotty appearance due to the rain, as you can see in my photo. The chairs had hours and most of the night to sit out and let the product soak in before it rained, so I don't think timing was the issue.I really wanted to love this product because it appeared to work SO well, but how effective can it really be at protecting against UV fading if most of it rinses off after a light rain? I spent a couple hours wiping down all that furniture, and don‚Äôt want to have to do it again every time there's inclement weather. I‚Äôll continue using this for my original intended purpose - to wipe down the interior/trim/floor mats of our cars to keep it looking black - but probably wouldn‚Äôt bother with anything outdoor like patio furniture again.

  I don't understand how this works but it really does a great job! I have 1992 BMW e30 with faded interior and grills. After reading so much about this, I gave it a try and I am glad I did! This thing is simply magical! It leaves a film of silicone like protection on the surface. I used it on my leather seats, dash, tires and front grills and they came out perfect as brand new! The good thing is that this film is not oily unlike many other brands; it drys and protects the surface as well as adds a shiny touch.The best direction I found out useful is spray a lot on the surface..literally make it wet and leave for about an hour. You can also dampen a towel and use it to spread around the dashboard but it has to be wet! Do not worry; the surface will absorb and dry; whatever is remaining, simply wipe away with paper towel. My grills were grayed because of the age of the car, it applied three times and they came out black just like brand new! Make sure to wash the area perfectly before applying this magic!

  First off this product has thousands of favorable reviews, so a lot of folks like it.  I bought this product to enhance my new 2020 golf cart.  I applied it to the black ABS trim and bumpers and it did make the black stand out.  I then did my entire 80‚Äù black plastic top,, it put a low lustre sheen on it which is pleasing to me.  I then did all my seats front and back. I then did the floorboard which is covered with a black textured vinyl mat.  Honestly this product appears to be much like Armor All.  My only concern now is everything is super slippery.  The slipperiness does repel dirt and dust.  Here is my major complaint.  I have large oversized tires, tall and wide, on my golf cart so I went and treated the sidewalls as well.  Also treated the black plastic sleeve on the steering column which covers some wires.  After treating my entire vehicle it squeaks everywhere. The front bench seat now squeeKs with every bump. The steering column squeaks every time you turn the wheel.  The ABS plastic fenders squeak where they are attached to the fiberglass body. The back bench seat squeaks where it sits atop the fiberglass frame.  I got carried away and did our front porch swing and this morning I slipped out of it when I tried to get in.  This product is three times the cost of Armor All and twice as slippery.  Aerospace Slick-um.

  I didn't intend to buy this...Neither did anyone else in the house.  It just popped up in my cart and my wife thought ""Oh, I guess he wants a hat.""  Turns out when I gave my mom a phone three months ago she never logged into her own account and was trying to buy this for my dad.  Mine, now.The material seems pretty solid. The brim is absolutely huge and kept the sun off my neck while I was outside today.  I like the netting on the sides of the hat, too.  Kept my head nice and cool.  Also, I have a massive head and the hat fit just fine.  It is also adjustable with some elastic in the back.  The thing even has a chin strap for windy days.I'm actually kinda happy we got this.TLDR - My wife got me a hat I didn't want, and it's actually really comfortable and I'm keeping it.

  Okay.  So I bought this hat in anticipation for a new job that I was taking.  I started working construction in California.  What that means in English is that I am working outdoors in 100+ degree weather, with heavy steel toe boots on.I needed a hat to keep the sun out of my face.  I did not want a cowboy hat.  I did not want a straw hat.  I did not want a baseball cap.  I wanted something neutral and functional.This hat has exceeded my expectations to the point where I am writing a review.  I am doing so without compensation, without being asked, without anything other then the fact that this hat has SAVED me from the sun.Now.  The back rim does not completely cover my neck.  The side rim does not necessarily work for guarding against the sun while driving.  However, it stays on well, is fairly comfortable (and I am talking many, MANY hours of wearing this thing), and dries quickly from wetness (um, sweat, I sweat a LOT.)I will go so far as to say, I will likely purchase a spare.  This will show how important this thing has become to me as a ""tools of the trade.""  I live in fear that I will lose this thing.  I FEEL it when I am working outdoors and do not have it.  I will take it with me ""just in case.""  So yeah.  I'm buying another.

  I was not sure about this hat when it arrived, but when I realized you can adjust the band around your head I now wear it everywhere. Dog park, farmers market, doing chores, you forget you have it on and it keeps the sun off. Really like it!Update: 8/2020 This is my favorite hat and I own ones from Patagonia, San Diego Hat Co and others. You can wash it- but i did not put it in dryer. The brim is perfect width and sturdiness (no flopping).

  I like the hat alright but the green/grey hat fades to a tannish orange color around where it absorbs sweat. This started to happen right away. I've only had the hat for about a month now and it looks pretty bad but when I'm wearing it all of me looks pretty bad because I'm working in the yard so I really don't care much. I have a pretty big head and the hat fits me just fine.UPDATE JUNE 18, 2018. Originally gave the hat 3 stars because of discoloration. The manufacturer contacted me and provided a new hat in the Khaki color free of charge and I have not had the same problem with this hat. It does appear to be a different type of fabric and fits a little differently but still a good hat.. Changing my review to 5 stars for excellent customer service and a decent hat overall.

  Love the hat!  The brim is flexible, but not flimsy.The sun protection is there from both the SPF and the width of the hat itself.My only gripe would be that it is a bit tight on my head at the opening.  I don't blame the hat for this, as every head is sized and shaped differently, but if you have a larger head, be aware that this ""might"" not fit you well if you like a looser fitting hat.The reason that I bring this up, is that you have an adjustable chin strap / cord (whatever it's called) that should keep the hat on your head if it was a looser fit.Great hat!!!

  Brim nice and stiff unlike those annoying floppy type of wide brim hats.I have an average head and it fits me great.  There's a cord around the outside with a little adjuster kind of thingie.  But there's also a couple tabs of webbing inside that you can tie to adjust fit.  I've used for 4-5 days and adjustment seems to work good so far.I spent a lot of time looking for a wide hat that provides a lot of sun protection, stays on well, and doesn't obscure my vision.  I think my search is ended.  Very pleased.

  Oh my goodness, WHY had no one ever told me that this product existed? I came across these while browsing knee sleeves. I have knee sleeves and have had different brands through the years, the latest being ""copper fit"", and they are okay but aren't as stable as I need. When I saw these, I was intrigued enough to wonder if they worked. After I ordered them, I was talking to a friend that said they had used these years ago and they worked good. The day they arrived I went to the store without opening up the package yet. While in the store, my knee gave ALL THE WAY out and I almost fell underneath the cart, thank goodness I was holding on at the time. Now, my knee has gone out from time to time, but NEVER like this, and it kept going out the rest of the trip. As soon as I got home I put this on, and I cannot believe the difference it made! This thing is amazing!!! I tested it and walked around outside every which way I could, and it made my knee stable and not ONCE did it go out! It kept acting like it wanted to, but the ring stopped it in it's tracks! I LOVE my knee ring and I will never go out without it again! This is 10x better than a sleeve and will fit over or under your clothes. What I really love is the ability to tighten or loosen it to specifically fit YOU. I can walk so confident now! Thank you Ipow and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

  I've only been using this a short time but absolutely love it so far! I've had two knee surgeries in the last 7 months, so I purchased with the intent to relive pain on my fat pad/ patellar tendon area. I've also used the second band on my quad (probably not what it's made for) simply to apply pressure to that area in hopes itll relieve the pain I'm having there. So far I've strictly used it at home and in public when I need the extra stability, and so far it's helped tremendously!

  I am 30 years old and I have chondromalacia patella (runner's knee) in both of my knees due to a congenital condition, and severe arthritis in the right one. After been rushed into a surgery on my right knee by my orthopedist --and his scary sense of urgency, without a clear explanation of my condition and my options-- I had an injury that nobody believed that deserved attention. After a year, it was almost impossible for me to walk or even get out of the bed without severe pain. Tired of my orthopedist suggestions (more surgeries and injections), I did my own research on specialized books and medical literature, just to find out that instead of that surgery, I just needed physical therapy, in addition to any kind of knee support that felt right to me. So I stopped listening to my orthopedist, I bought these bands, and I started to work on my quadriceps. Since the very first day using these bands it was like a miracle. I could stand up without pain and started walking as if nothing had happened. Then a physical therapist explained me that these little guys just gave my knee caps and muscles the pressure and support that they needed. He also told me that eventually I will not need them if I keep working on my quadriceps. These bands, obviously, do not solve my general problem. My condition is degenerative, but now I know how to buy me more quality years before the knee replacement.I just have two complains:-The bands are loosing strength pretty fast, but that has happened with any other type of knee support that I had in the past (because I started to use other type of sleeves or braces since I was 14 years old).-They are bulky and make impossible to wear jeans on them. But I can live with that.Overall I am really happy that I found this product and that I decided to deal with my problem by myself.UPDATE (June 19th, 2017):I don't need to use these guys anymore on a regular basis. I worked hard on my quadriceps, and after a couple of months I didn't need the support. Now I am going to buy my second pair because I lost them on a trip. I only carry them when I know that I will be walking all day long, but it is mostly to have some peace of mind because I barely use them now.

  I have suffered from chronic knee pain while running for years now after experiencing an injury. With running being one of hobbies, I thought I‚Äôd never run again without being in extreme pain. These little contraptions have changed my life.. I now run without even the slightest pain in my knee... the only thing is that it‚Äôs kinda uncomfortable without long pants on. But that‚Äôs a sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to take for no pain. I‚Äôd highly recommend

  I have never had knee pain (played competitive soccer for 20+ years or while running). At age 32, I ran my first marathon in San Francisco and was training about 5 days a week. I started getting runner's knee when training got up to at 16-18 miles (approximately 3-4 weeks prior to the full marathon). I stopped running for approximately 3 weeks. I started wearing these as I started working my mileage back up and I also started to do quad exercises and foam rolling more frequently.While I can't say with certainty that there's any proof that these things helped me, what I can say is I wore them for the full marathon and only had a little chafing on my medial knee area and I didn't notice the chafing until mile 20. Enclosed is a picture of them at mile 25.

  These knee braces definitely help a lot. I was doing morning work outs which included jumping jacks and I couldn't have done it without this product as I felt no pain in my knees while using them. My husband had somehow injured his knee while a work and was still aching when he got home. I gave home one of these braces which he slept with and woke up with no pain at all the next morning.

  I had just received my order of these large bandages when I missed a stair and landed on my knee.  My bad knee.  I had a moment of ""be careful what you shop for"" when I realized the big, skinned wound was perfect for trying the new bandages.  And boy, have they been great!  If I didn't have to clean and air the scrape, I think one would have lasted days.  So, either a gentle spirit was looking out for me when I was inspired to buy these bandages, or a mischievous spirit tripped me on that last stair creating the need for same.  Hmmm...

  I need a large bandage to cover up a healed wound on the back of my neck that was caused by the negligence of a neurosurgeon not placing a drain when he did a relatively minor neurosurgical procedure. Now I have a big indentation on the back of my neck because the wound had to close from the vertebrae on out. I bought these to cover that big scooped out place when I‚Äôm out in public. Well, these bandages just don‚Äôt stick well to my skin. And I don‚Äôt perspire much. I don‚Äôt think there is enough adhesive around the edges to hold it in place all that well. I believe someone at that company should re-engineer their product.Although the cost wasn‚Äôt high, since they didn‚Äôt work, they were NOT cost effective.

  The size is true to packaging. The problem I have, and it's a major one, is that the bandage will not stayed here to the skin for more than a couple of hours. This is most definitely true if it is on an area of the skin that moves a lot such as a knee or elbow joint. I am now sorry I bought two boxes.

  Very STRONG. It actually leaves red marks on my back for a week after ripping it off. I had a mole removal on my back and whenever I moved I could feel the bandaid on my back. It‚Äôs not that flexible because the adhesive is so STRONG whenever I move I feel like the hairs on my body are ripping off. Ha it does its job. Just not comfortable on my back. It could also be because the healing process is bothersome as well. It‚Äôs hard to tell.Very thick bandaid too. It would definitely absorb any small cut. I would suggest this if you‚Äôre looking for a bandaid that will STAY ON haha!

  These bandages are well made and are not too sticky making them easy to remove when changing them.  The fabric is strong and will not fall apart even under extreme conditions.  Since they are fabric and not waterproof I recommend changing them at least once a day to prevent infection.  They are also underpriced 30 bandages for less than the price of the name brand.  It was the price that added one star to the four stars I otherwise would have given this product.

  I tried these because of positive reviews & cost savings but no idea why they exist unless they've changed, because they don't stick.  The pad has a plastic coating which I guess is OK in some cases to keep it from sticking to the wound but it may not be absorbent when needed.  I'd include that info if it would stay put longer than 3 seconds.My skin was clean & dry and I pressed it firmly into place & held it there for a bit.  It was on my elbow but we also tried one on my husband's shin, where it stayed longer but still came off.In pics with 2, the bandage with gauze pad all the way across is Bandaid Flex Fabric.I'm sticking with Bandaid brand.  They may cost more but I've used flex fabric type for years with no issues.  I also prefer the pad to go all the way across.  If this brand fixes the issues, I'll reconsider.

  Fits well. Provides excellent support. There are three belts. Can be worn alone (lightest support) or all together (maximum support). I usually wear two belts to be able to sit and moved around comfortably. These were really helpful when I started to exercise again after giving birth. I got the medical clearance from my doctor, but my abdominals were so week and belly skin so floppy, that I needed something to help hold everything together. I like wearing the belts to bed as well and wake up to flatter tummy. I've tried several different products from belly bandit to corsets. I liked these the best because they were a good mix of effective and comfort. Of course no compression garment is truly comfortable, but I can live with this.

  This product is fantastic! I didn‚Äôt use it with my first pregnancy, the picture on the left. I used it after having surrogate twins and I‚Äôm way smaller and feel more put together after using this. I only wear it about 50% of the time. I didn‚Äôt follow the instructions, instead I just started wearing all three parts one day after vaginal delivery. My only complaint is that they move a bit when I sit down or bend over. Not a lot, but I notice it. I wish there was a rubber strip or something on the edges to hold it in place better.

  This has been amazing at helping me get my body back! I‚Äôve only used the belly belt for several hours each day (I don‚Äôt sleep with it on) starting 4 days after my c section. The after picture is only 6 days later! I wish I had put it on sooner because it really offers the support my stomach needs. Once my incision heals more I‚Äôll add the other parts.Edit: I loved this product for immediately following my c section. Baby is 3mos old now and I don‚Äôt wear it at all anymore. I‚Äôm just focusing on my diet and workouts now that I‚Äôve been cleared by my doctor.

  I'm six weeks postpartum and I have LOVED these bands! I followed the guidance (wearing the first band days 1-7, adding the second band in week two) and I plan on adding band 3 in the upcoming weeks. I don't wear them all day every day but have tried to wear them when I can and I think it has significantly helped in my shrinking back down.Everyone is different and bounces back differently but I personally was back at my pre-baby weight and wearing my old clothes again by week three and four. I owe part of that to wearing these bands I think.I also got an exercise waist band (I didn't want to sweat all over these while walking and exercising) and that's aided in the same way.I am normally 170 in weight (I'm 5'7) and i have an average athletic build. At the end of my pregnancy I weighed 206 so I got the 4XL size (who came up with these sizes anyway!?!?) and they fit perfectly. Attached end of preggo pic and a recent pic for body comparison if you're on the fence on what size to get or if you think it will fit you. Would definitely recommend this!!!

  These are not 1"" x 3"". They're 3/4"" x 3! In the photos I have an old one with the exact same stock number. I don't mind paying more for the BandAid brand, but it's not only not what I ordered, but it's misleading and intentionally wrong!!

  Flexible fabric, all one size. These are the only band-aids I ever need and they seem to be impossible to find in stores in my area.I really like that the fabric allows for good air flow and evaporation...so even if you get them wet, they don't end up trapping a lot of water against your skin. And they stay on forever! If you're able to put them somewhere (like around a finger) where you can overlap one end over the other...they almost never come off!

  All of Band-Aid's bandages are now latex free. This is a big deal to those of us with a latex allergy. I am happy to know I won't have to be returning any more Band-Aid Flexible Fabric Bandages due to latex being an ingredient when it appeared in the ad that they had a lighter blue lid that indicated no latex. Great step forward and thank you! I will purchase from this Seller again.

  Sometimes Amazon's Choice isn't really what you would like, so just be aware and careful.  These are 3/4"" and what I had wanted was 1"" but I still purchased these because I didn't want a variety of sized that I would never use.  I like how they stick so easily even on knuckles and places that bend.  Although they are only meant to stay on for 24 hours, I have kept them on for longer, but 24 hours is really all that they should stay on.  Overall nice, but next time I will look for the one inch ones.

  Amazon shipped the Band-Aids and another brand All Health, in a pouch, and of course everything got smashed. One Band-Aid's sleeve was opened and compromised. If you can order a few other things with the bandages in your next order, so that Amazon ships everything in a box, then it maybe worth while to buy bandages from Amazon. (But then again the bandages can still get smashed.)

0,SPORTS,"Fitbit Versa 2 Health and Fitness Smartwatch with Heart Rate, Music, Alexa Built-In, Sleep and Swim Tracking, Black/Carbon, One Size (S and L Bands Included)",$174.00,3,"
  Pros:__________‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs very comfortable. When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn‚Äôt bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.‚Ä¢ The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it‚Äôs almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.‚Ä¢ I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.‚Ä¢ The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.‚Ä¢ The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).‚Ä¢ Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you‚Äôre able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.‚Ä¢ I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.‚Ä¢ The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you ‚Äúactually‚Äù have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it‚Äôs within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.‚Ä¢ The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn‚Äôt new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You‚Äôll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.‚Ä¢ Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It‚Äôs hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit‚Äôs friendly visual graphs, you don‚Äôt have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.‚Ä¢ Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.‚Ä¢ One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I‚Äôm a huge fan of this because you‚Äôre not wearing the watch every second of your life. It‚Äôs nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.‚Ä¢ Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don‚Äôt use Uber, but it‚Äôs good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.‚Ä¢ Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It‚Äôs also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.‚Ä¢ Yes, you can swim with it. Haven‚Äôt tested this out though.‚Ä¢ Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I‚Äôm using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________‚Ä¢ There is a connectivity issue that I‚Äôm dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it‚Äôs doing this  but I‚Äôve noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.‚Ä¢ Another issue with the connectivity is you won‚Äôt know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.‚Ä¢ On the display, I felt Fitbit‚Äôs main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don‚Äôt use this device often you‚Äôre going to be lost in there OS.‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don‚Äôt want to pay a monthly payment then you‚Äôre stuck with the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù software of the watch.‚Ä¢ No idea why Fitbit did this but you can‚Äôt stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can‚Äôt even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.‚Ä¢ Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you‚Äôll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa‚Äôs answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.‚Ä¢ To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon‚Äôs Alexa‚Äôs app on the phone and have an account with it.‚Ä¢ No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.‚Ä¢ No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn‚Äôt find it to be that much off, but it‚Äôs enough that I think you should know.‚Ä¢ Has some thick bezels around the screen.‚Ä¢ If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.‚Ä¢ I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it‚Äôs a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.‚Ä¢ Currently I can‚Äôt respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.‚Ä¢ I notice that Fitbit doesn‚Äôt have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you‚Äôre going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn‚Äôt an issue but it‚Äôs something to note in the long run due to security reasons.‚Ä¢ You can‚Äôt even store your favorite apps for quick access.‚Ä¢ Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.‚Ä¢ When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you‚Äôre going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you‚Äôre not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.‚Ä¢ Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It‚Äôs not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It‚Äôs a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you‚Äôre only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it‚Äôs one of the few devices that can visually show you that you‚Äôre improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it‚Äôs not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn‚Äôt. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium ‚Äúmonthly‚Äù services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn‚Äôt useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn‚Äôt in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you‚Äôre looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn‚Äôt.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

  The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.

  ¬†Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it‚Äôs 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I‚Äôll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can‚Äôt believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It‚Äôs supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I‚Äôll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won‚Äôt make the same mistake.

  These Gatorade bottles are terrible. The invention of the screw cap has been around for quite some time, so I‚Äôm pretty confused how Gatorade has managed to screw it up. You have a better chance at curing world hunger than getting these lids to screw on without leaking. When I was a kid, gatorade bottles were all anyone had. Now they are so cheap and poorly plastic. Next time you see someone using a Gatorade bottle, go over and give them a hug. That person most likely needs one after dealing with these stupid lids. The struggle is real, my friends. They. Are. Terrible.

  ¬†The lids of these water bottles are horrible and do not seat on the bottle well at all. When the bottle is squeezed, the bottle deforms enough for the seal between the bottle and lid to open which causes drink to spill out, as shown clearly in the video. I was hoping these would be better than the Straight Wall Gatorade Squeeze Bottles I've had, but these are so much worse. Skip these Easy Grip bottles and instead buy the Straight Wall bottles. I have owned several of the straight wall bottles over several years and they have never leaked like these Easy Grip bottles have from Day 1.I purchased two and both show this exact same flaw and it is widely reported in the comments, which shows this is a design defect and not just a 1-off problem with my bottles.

  I read a lot of these reviews and there was several that said they leak however, I got two of them and as long as you put the lids on straight they do not leak what-so-ever!  My teenage sons wanted these for water and to use at school for gym class.  I also ordered a Gatorade GX personalized cup with pods off the website but it was 25$.  I haven't got it yet to compare the quality.  With that said these seem to be nice bottle especially for the price.  They are 32 oz. so they hold a lot of water or whatever you want in there.  There is clear strip on the side that can be used to check how much you have in there or have left.  Useful for anyone trying to increase the amount of water they intake daily or those that like to keep track.  So far so good, I'll update should any problems ever arise.  These are also dishwasher safe on the top rack if you use a dishwasher, I prefer hand washing as I think it gets dishes cleaner especially bottles like this.

  Lids leaked. I believe its a manufactturing issue. I contacted the seller, within a few hours they responed. Impressive!!! I was instructed to file a refund. However, they are checking to see if they can get 2 lids for me. The bottles were fine, just leaking lids. Im waiting to hear back from the company before I return the product.  Otherwise, I love these bottles. They do sweat, you can't avoid that. Rating was on the product not the seller, so far Im impressed with the seller.

  Solid water bottles.  I use them regularly for exercising and just life in general.  Very convenient for hydrating while working out or quickly without having to remove a lid or anything.They do have some design issues where depending on how you hold it and squeeze it, water will leak out from the lid which can be very annoying and get your shirt wet.  It seems like it varies depending on the water bottle itself.  Hit or miss.  I have also had small holes/cracks form where you squeeze the bottles after having them for a while.  Presumably do to the plastic breaking after such long use.  Additionally, you have to be aware when flying with these that the change in air pressure will affect them and cause them to spray water/leak.  I usually try to loosen the lid after take off so the pressure can equalize.Overall, I would recommend these water bottles.

  I carry a water bottle with me at all times and have tried most major brands - Camelback, Nalgene, etc‚Ä¶  The Gatorade Squeeze bottles are by far my favorite.  I own 8 of them and have never had one leak or malfunction in over a year - that is why I just bought 2 more.  Since there is no cap to open you don't have to put your dirty hands all over the top of the bottle to open it.  Not saying everyone's hands are dirty but you get what I am saying.A lot of reviews have said they have a problem with black mold forming inside the cap and it can't be cleaned off.  If you are putting any type of sports drink (say Gatorade‚Ä¶) in the bottle then it needs to be washed like any other bottle or cup you drink from.  Sugar and other additives in sports drinks can form mold.  Common sense.  I ONLY use these for purified water and I have never had a problem with mold.  I reccomend keeping the ones used only as water bottles separate from the ones you put other beverages in.These bottles can't be beat and given the price if you lose one you aren't out a lot of money like other high end water bottles

  Do not buy! The new design of these bottles leaks to the point it's unusable. I have the older version that doesn't have contoured sides. It worked great for years. These new designs have less threading on the lid and the bottle. So it is quicker to get the lid off which perhaps they saw as a benefit to trainers that need to undo dozens of these at a time but less threading makes the bottle too weak. So after about 3 times using it, the pressure is too much for the lid and it starts to leak out of the seams between the lid and bottle. I'm returning mine for a refund. May try to find the older version of the bottle.

  I have had these bottles for about 2 weeks and use them daily. They hold a lot of water, are easy to drink from, and easy to clean and care for. There's a clear strip along the side so you can keep any eye on how full the bottle is. You can also put your finger over the mouthpiece to prevent leaking if you want to shake up your drink without making a mess.Overall I'm happy with these bottles and think they are a good value for the cost.

  This is a review on the product for what it's intended for regarding tennis not a dog toy... I decided to give these a try since making the switch to pressureless tennis balls, unfortunately I have to leave these a negative review.  The balls didn't have enough bounce and all the bounce between the balls was different from each other there by making the experience very frustrating and unprofessional, also quality of felt was terrible and came off almost instantly after a few hours of play... Worst  pressureless balls I ever played with.  I'll stick with the PENN pressureless balls, they seem to be the best in my opinion..

  My dog is a fetch/ball maniac and would go through normal tennis balls over the course of a couple of weeks.  Not from malicious chewing, but just wear and tear from fetching and carrying.  I bought this bag over two years ago and still have about 8 left, I may have lost a few in the woods, but these last way longer than expected.  No cracking or ripping and cleaning with water keeps them hi-viz green.

  If you work around 3,000 lb Elephant Seals on a beach you'd know two things, 1- they are very dangerous, and 2- they are federally protected. If you hurt a seal there is problems ahead. Our solution to self preservation of the human species is a couple of tennis balls handy to bounce off the nose of an offending creature when they get too close. That turns them around.My other use is to run-off the noisy screaming Ringneck Doves that sit on our roof and scream for hours. When patience runs out, it's time to act and tennis balls won't damage the shingle or windows, plus no dead bodies to rot away up there. Not to mention the dog thinks it's a game and chases the balls when they bounce back. Although the dog can 'skin' a tennis style ball made for dogs, she can't peel off the cover on one of these. Perfect.They are probably good for tennis too.

  I bought these for my German shepherd because they were cheap and she goes through tennis balls like it's her job. Now it might say it in the product description and I wasn't paying enough attention to notice, but these are a little bit smaller than a normal-sized tennis ball. We use a Chuck-It for her, and they do fit in that, but not as solidly as a regular-sized tennis ball, so they don't go as far, but for the price, I'm not complaining.

  These are very nice balls and I am sure they would hold up in a tennis match but they are no MATCH (pun intended) for my dog. I needed them for the IFETCH ball thrower but they last about 2 days for each ball and my dog has them completely chewed up. She is such a poor sport. She loses a match and she eats the balls. Isnt there a rule against that? Oh well time to buy 18 more of them! 5 stars for holding up for 2 days at leastUpdate: My dog can crush these now within 5 min. of playing with them. She is a 30lb mini Aussie. I think the rubber is really old because after she ""breaks"" them I inspect them and the rubber crumbles. As in, I can break pieces off. Junk Dont buy.

  I read a lot of recent reviews mentioning foul odors and missing balls.  The company must have solved those problems; my bag of tennis balls had 18 regular sized tennis balls, ordinary color and average new odor.  I have an excellent sniffer, so I was concerned about the chance of stinky balls...I imagine a dog would hate that too.  It's too early for me to comment on their durability, but so far, so good.

  Fantastic. I was getting a lot of pain around my mid-back and I was told that my back muscles were very tense. I read up on foam rollers and the wonders they work so I decided to give this one a shot, since it was highly recommended on a separate website due to its durability and very low price. I went with the 36"" roller, as most guides recommended longer rollers for those who are just beginning to use them. I followed some guides on the proper use and on my first use, it hurt like crazy. I had to grit my teeth and swear a lot, but once I rolled off, I noticed my entire back felt limber, if slightly numb. The best part was that the pain was gone, and it seems for the long run. I can sit in my office chair without getting that lingering pain. I use it almost daily now, and it doesn't hurt to use it anymore. Turns out my muscles were knotted up and they were tensing up all the time on their own, and this worked out all the issues. I've started using more techniques to isolate specific muscles and it feels great. I would recommend to anyone that's looking to loosen up their muscles, particularly if they're always tense.

  Unfortunately this roller has raised seams in both sides of the roller that you can feel as you roll. It's not smooth. The material also feels like a styrofoam cooler. You can feel the little blue dots with your hand. I'm not sure how the roller would hold up in the end. I bought it as a gift and wished I had checked it out before giving it. I just assumed by the price and reviews that this was a good product. We have experience with several other rollers to compare this to. On the up side - it looks cool.

  Great foam roller. I was debating which size to get because I wanted a foam roller large enough to use on my entire body but wanted to pay as little as possible. I decided to go with the 18 inch roller and it was perfect. It's large enough to cover big areas such as your back and thighs, but small enough to easily store it in a closet or under your bed when not using it.

  It arrived in just 2 days although I didn't have Amazon Prime.I like the blue speckled color. It had raised seam on one side as some people noted in the reviews. But I was prepared and just chopped the raised foam pieces with my nail clipper. It was an easy fix, and the seam became flat & smooth in 5 minutesI chose the size very carefully - I'm 5'3'' and didn't need the roller to be too big but made sure that it was long enough for the effective hamstring & quadriceps stretch exercise. Most of the yoga mat is 24"" wide, so I knew that a 24"" roller would be a little too long when you do the stretch on the mat. A 12"" roller would be a little too small for my big thigh and if I wanted to put both thighs and legs on it at the same time. The 18"" was the perfect length as I had expected. It is, however, not long enough if you want to use it as a yoga bolster and place it vertically under your back.I tried the thigh stretch with this foam roller, and it was very firm and pressing the right muscles. I also rolled it under my back from thoracic to lower back areas, and it felt SO GOOD. The roller is also useful to get my back ready in the position to do a bridge and to safely come down from the bridge by landing my upper back on it.This $16 foam roller was a great purchase and nice addition to my home exercise tools.

  The amount of four letter words I shouted while rolling my IT band after getting this bad boy CANNOT be understated.  Mother of Christmas this thing should be used to extract information from terrorists...or cheating spouses.  However, it does the job at hand, works out kinks in the muscles and helps you break down all the bad stuff...for a really good price.  I recommend it, but you may also want to gag yourself while you do it if you have small kids, as you WILL swear and then they will repeat it at daycare the next day while you put your hands up the air and give the look to the teacher like ""how have they ever heard that word?  I don't say those words, they must have heard that from Tommy over there"" and then you go home and have a glass of wine to make yourself feel better.

  My chiropractor recommended I buy the 36"" version of this for some daily routine back stretching to do at home.  This product has been amazing for stretching, and massaging sore muscles throughout my back and shoulders.  I feel very supported by this roller and have had no issues with it thus far.  I'm not sure what kind of things people are doing to break and chip away at this thing.  I Weigh 200 pounds and have yet to damage this roller after weeks of use.  I guess don't use it as a replacement for your 9-iron, and it should hold up very well. Overall very pleased with this product. And at such a great price, I honestly can't find a single negative remark to note about it.-Great for relieving sore muscles-Very durable-Easily supports a 200lb person for exercising-Inexpensive, but very high-qualityWould highly recommend this to anyone looking to exercise and relieve soreness of muscles.

  This is a really good wrist support for use during the day. I've suffered from episodes of bursitis for several years now that will last a few weeks each time.At first I made the common mistake of assuming ""bigger is better"" and wearing a heavy rigid brace with steel inserts during the day.I learned though that doing that isn't a good idea, it gets in the way of everything and it's not good to have your wrist imobilized all day and nightI definitely do recommend getting a night brace, but get something like this for during the day.You can quickly tell that whoever made this support really thought about it. It's very minimalist, which makes it light and comfortable, I've worn it every day for weeks before and it never gets annoying.The fabric is very good quality, it's very durable and flexible, and stays relatively clean and dry.My only real complaint is the size. I'd usually wear XL or 2X gloves, but this is ""one size fits all"". It certainly does fit, but it would fit better if it were larger. It starts to slip off sometimes and a couple times a day I have to adjust it.For an average person I doubt that would be an issue though. In my ideal world they should make an S-M and an M-XL version

  I have weakness at the base of my hand just before my wrist. The wrap works pretty well but not perfectly as my chronic injury doesn‚Äôt receive complete support. However, I will say within its construction, there is a small Velcro patch stitched within the strap to help keep the strap in place when putting it on. And the main Velcro is very durable too. Not sure about the copper; don‚Äôt know where it is located or what it does. After wearing the strap for a few hours, it leaves a strong pungent smell both within the strap & on my wrist. I‚Äôve worn the wrap daily for about 1 month & the fibers of the wrap are beginning to fray due to the putting on & off the Velcro. Also the material is beginning to tear between the thumb & index finger area. Had hoped it would have lasted much longer. Am grateful for the product as it has provided some support as I work in a factory setting lifting & sorting many wood products.

  I would of given this a 5 star review; however, there is one circle of velcro-sih stuff on the inside that is irritating my skin a little. This circle is there to help fasten everything on the right side of your wrist, under your pinky... but my wrist is not small enough for it to help and it rubs against my skin instead of the fabric. My wrist measures 6 1/2 inches around, it's not a big wrist at all. I can tighten everything and make the circle touch the fabric and not my skin, but it ends up being too tight and bothers me after a while. This obviously helps fasten and secure everything for people with tiny wrists, so if you are reading this and have a wrist smaller than mine than this thing is great for you. Other than this little irritating circle, I like this product. It does the job, it is comfortable (besides the little circle thing), it's very well made and not cheap, and it's even washable. If it wasn't for the little circle I would not even know I had it on. I can live with the irritating circle, it's not like it's causing a skin rash or anything major enough for me to return it, I can deal with it. This thing is helping my wrist out tremendously (carpel tunnel) and the benefits far outweigh the minor irritation.

  I'm the least flexible person in the world. And, all my muscles are constantly clenched because I sleep knotted up in a ball and keep all of my stress stored safely in my muscles. I could pop a hamstring just standing up straight.BUT - this thing is amazing for stretching, especially if you are not naturally stretchy. Sometimes I just lie on the floor of my living room and stretch while watching TV. The book that comes with it is also really helpful and with vaguely late-80s photographs that sometimes take my mind off of the muscle spasms.I hate exercise but stretching with this strap saves me from crumbling to the ground in a pile of snapped tendons. It also helps in yoga, another workout I like based on the amount of lying down.

  I was in physical therapy for severe spinal issues (5 level spinal fusion with metal plates + an new compression fracture in my fusion.)  I practiced my ""back exercises"" for the last 37 years which helped tremendously while I was young.  Now that I've hit 60's, my back pain and issues are severe.  While in PT, the therapist had me use this stretch using it very conservative at first. I had absolutely no ability to use this at first. But under his gentle direction, gradually was able to stretch more using this while lying on my back and my other knee bent.  The stretch strap has helped tremendously.  I do use it religiously every single day.

  I ordered one of these back in 2013 on the advice of my chiropractor.  I  LOVED it!  I traveled a lot and could take this anywhere.  However, in one of my many moves, I lost my booklet.  There were always a few exercises I knew and always did but wanted to see what else I could do now that I am retired.  Wrote the company and immediately got an answer back from Ed that he would send me the booklet.  Holy Cow Batman...I was amazed at the fast response but more amazed that he did not charge me and sent it almost as fast as his email reply.  Great piece of equipment and even greater customer service!  Mucho thanks Ed!!!

  Shocking but amazing results from doing simple stretches. Saw this strap demonstrated on YouTube. Bob and Brad physical therapists recommended for different things. I wrenched my knee twice, a few days apart. I've used the strap to stretch and strengthen the supports to my knee. I was sceptical but it really made a difference for me. Ice packs and ibuprofen and this strap got me through the rough spots. When i don't use it, the pain comes back. My knee is healing nicely. I'll continue to use it because it's good therapy for anyone. I'm in my 60's. Highly satisfied.

  Embarrassingly, I am in physical therapy for the ironic overuse of my gluteus medius and minimus muscles, otherwise known as the ""forgotten butt muscle."" Definitely too much TMI, but part of that therapy focuses on stretching and strengthening the hip flexors, the back and hamstrings.  If you've ever tried to stretch your hamstrings on your own, this is close to impossible to do well - until this nifty device.I was introduced to this Stretch Out Strap (the acronym SOS is not lost on me in my current hobbled state) during physical therapy as a way to perform a variety of stretches on my own at home and without a partner.  Pure genius.  There is nothing to adjust - there are foot loopholes sewn into the nylon, so you simply put your foot in the loop that works for you.This strap also comes with a book of various stretches - some of which look way too elaborate - so I am sticking with the simple hamstring stretch and a few other simpler hip stretches until I get better at using the strap.  For the price (approximately $15), I am using it quite a bit for stretches I couldn't do before on my own.Although my ""issue"" hasn't resolved, I am at least sure that I am getting in the best stretching I can during my home exercise program with teh use of this band.

The OPTP strap is a thick nylon strap of high quality and the straps we received appeared to be made of cotton with a slightly different design.

  I started doing yoga and pilates maybe 4-5 times per week about six months ago, and I‚Äôve seen such a dynamic change in the way that my body both works and feels, that I‚Äôve become a bit of an addict when it comes to the lifestyle. One of the girls I met in my vinyasa class recommended getting a strap to stretch out my body in different ways (as flexibility is my main weakness) and I started the hunt for one that would give results. I initially planned on getting one from a yoga goods company, but I started seeing information throughout my search on straps meant for restorative therapy, and opted to give that a look. I found this particular one on a fitness blog, and opted to give it a try a) because the price was right b) all of the reviews specifically mentioned the term ‚Äúrange of motion‚Äù and c) because those loops looked like they would be great to play around with. I got the strap and started giving it a try, and while I initially had no clue as to what I was doing, I eventually got the hang of it and started using it on almost a daily basis. On days when I was feeling particularly sore from class, I would rub on a little of my tea tree based pain reliever,¬†

  I created this balloon install for my friends daughters grad party and this product was a life saver. Really. I would have died trying to blow up all these balloons. This machine takes a bit of finesse but once you get the hang of it it is smooth sailing. Has troubles w the smaller balloons and the long balloons. The trick is to hold the balloon on the nozzle and stretch the balloon until the latex is thin enough for the machine to push the air in. It also helps to stretch the balloon a few times to loosen the latex. Over all I am happy with this machine.The air does blow out a little hot. So don't try to hold your finger over the holes. I can assume the heat is what helps the latex to expand.

  I thought this product would be too much for the small party decorating we had in mind or that it would be a piece of junk that failed after the 3rd balloon.  But the pump was easy to use and lightweight but up to the task of filling 50 balloons without difficulty. We plan on using it for our next party!

  I really like this. It made blowing up balloons soooo much easier. The materials to make a balloon Garland were very helpful as well. I just wish it was more quiet...dont expect to hide in another room doing balloons lol! It is loud! It can also get fairly hot, so be careful around little kids. Lastly, the stickers to stick the balloons together dont work, so I just used tape instead. I also saw this at party city for 40.00 so the price is awesome! I would buy it again for this price and would recommend itPlease click helpful if this was helpful

  I made a balloon arch for the first time ever and could NOT have done it without this! I love the different nozzle sizes, and that you can just push the nozzle down to make the air flow as you need it instead of having it run the whole time. Highly recommend!!For the extras, I didn't think I would use the balloon knotter, but my fingers got sore halfway through and it did help a lot. The wall hooks didn't support the weight of our arch, so we ended up using 3m velcro hooks with the fishing line. I didn't end up needing the glue dots.

I blew up 100 balloons and assembled my balloon arch/garland in less than 2hours I‚Äôd say depends on your energy level, it took me about 1.5 hours give or take.

  This balloon pump iis awesome.  Something you can use again and again.  Made blowing up the balloons so easy and a little fun.  I can't imagine blowing them up by mouth to make an arch.  Worth the price for a lot of balloons.  The products inside were worth it too to make your balloon arrangement.

  This has helped me reach my goal of being able to do a pull up. I have had this for 6 months now and am satisfied with the results I have gotten with my workouts. This comes in different resistance levels differentiated by color. I started doing assisted pullups with the green band, which has the strongest resistance, and have now transitioned to pullups with no assist. It definitely helps get you started and makes you feel accomplished to be able to do the exercise. I also use it for banded good mornings, which also works well for it.

  So far we have only used the red and black bands for stretching and resistance.  I guess we aren't strong enough or imaginative enough for the others yet but we'll get there.  They are latex material.  This is a high quality set of bands and will work for anyone needing a little extra help stretching out those sore achy muscles after a workout and stiff ones for before the workout.  You can also use them to build upon the strength you have and as a portable gym on the go. We use them to stretch out before deadlifts and squats.  Also to help strengthen those knees and hips.

I'm 6'1"" and I was leary how far I could stretch these from the bottom of my feet to the tops of my hands overhead, silly I know, but in my mind I envisioned them snapping and popping me in the face, haha.  No risks of that happening.  They are mobile, they work muscle areas that weights simply can not reach and they overall make you stronger with a followed routine.  There are copious amounts of youtube videos for lessons and routines to follow. Love them!

  Well, the red band finally snapped after 2 years of moderate use.  It was good while it lasted, especially considering the price.  But I was surprised it frayed when it didn't really rub against anything abrasive (like the floor).  The bands are good to use and has its place in between weights and cardio.  It's definitely good for travel.  Overall, I like the bands and would recommend them as a supplemental use.Update: It looks like 2 years is the breaking point (literally), because today the purple band snapped.  When I inspected the second purple band, that one has frayed also, so I don't think I'll be using it any longer.  It appears to be have dried out.So once again, good product considering what it costs, but don't expect it to last too long.

1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,2,"
  This is the first time I have ever written a review of a purchased product, but I was so dismayed by this, I had to write something.  I bought this as a gift for Christmas for my kids.  I was a bit shocked at the price of this product when I saw it on Amazon, but I figured it would be worth it.  Wrong!  As this was to be his ""Santa"" gift, I felt so sheepish when my son pulled it out of the box.  It is made of the cheapest grade plastic you can imagine.  The netting is just some basic, flimsy net that you have to keep pulling on to get it to be tight enough to actually bounce the ball.  The balls are what you might find at the dollar store.  I spent Christmas morning, and every time I see it in my son's room, thinking about how it is probably the invention of some frat bro who realized he could make millions putting this thing into people's homes by having it cost him about $3.50 per set to manufacture, and selling it for $60.  I am certain he has achieved that goal.  There is nothing about this that says quality or built to last.  I suppose, in the plus column, one could say that it is easily transportable for a spontaneous SpikeBall tournament on the beach, or that you aren't going to worry too much about it breaking, except that you wasted $60 on it.  Disappointed to say the least.
"
1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,2,"
  Very overpriced for what you get. Rim is flimsy and distorts when net tightened enough to make balls bounce properly. Biggest disappointment was that net tore after only a few days of playing. Now what?
"
1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,1,"
  Extremely impractical, cannot enjoy. The videos about how fun it is are extremely misleading. Once you actually try it, you suddenly see that the net is not stable, i.e. moves around when hit by a ball, and not really bouncy, despite being pulled on the rim very tightly, not bouncy enough even with balls pumped well. What is really bad is the concept, since the active part of the net is much smaller than the size of the rim - the ball does not bounce well when hitting close to the rim, even if it does not hit the rim itself, and so, need to hit the small area in the very center of the net if want the hit to not be affected by the rim. It was a gift to our boys, so, I hesitated to return it, hoping they would like it anyway, but by the time it is clear they cannot make any sense of it it is also too late to return ... I don't know what kind of genius marketed this thing, really smart, since it does look appealing until you actually try playing, and its production cost must be much smaller than the price, since the whole thing is really cheaply made - the rim is an easily bent plastic tube, the balls are very primitive too.
"
1,SPORTS,"Spikeball Standard 3 Ball Kit - Game for The Backyard, Beach, Park, Indoors",$59.95,1,"
  This is a fun game however the net sucks. I would not recommend spending the money on this. Especially since we are always re-stretching out the net and it just does not have enough bounce to it. We seriously have had more fun with a small exercise tramp and racquetballs and get a better result. Just my opinion maybe we are playing it wrong and don't really understand the game but I think if it had a better net or bouncing system it would be awesome and more worth the money. This is really cheap in my opinion. Sorry and Thanks

  We are HOOOKED on Spikeball!Me and my buddies (all 24-25) went out to Wisconsin for weekend of camping and brought this along. We nearly played all day! It was so fun to learn the rules and get better at this game. If you give it a try and put some effort into it, the learning curve is quick. After a couple hours, we were all running around the circle like pros.I would reccomend watching a video or two before playing just so you can understand how the flow of the game goes. Either way, just remember, its essentially Volleyball, but instead of the ball going over the net, once it HITS the net the other team takes service.Have fun! They also sell glow in the dark balls so you can play at night!

  I have never tried any other brace. But I am a new mom and have De Quervains Tenosynovitis from and needed to demobilize my tendon on my thumb.  This works pretty well. I LIVE in this brace. I only take it off to shower.It works pretty well for my condition, however it does not completely stop my tendon from moving.  Since I can not completely give my hands rest (i have a baby.. there is no getting around using my hands)  So sometimes when using my hand, it gets tweaked and OMG, the pain is horrible.I showed my doctor this brace and she said it should be stiffer and recommended a medical grade one.I am still going to use this one for now as it is a lot softer then the medical ones and I dont want to hurt the baby and its easier to sleep in it.I probably would recommend this brace if you could actually give your injury true rest. But so far, ive been wearing it for 5 weeks and my injury has not healed at all.

  It works for immobilizing the thumb if you don't plan to use the affected hand at all. There's a double stitch right at the crack of the thumb that creates so much pressure with the sharp stitches I can't decide what pain is worse, the pain from the injury or the pain from the brace. Re-injured myself while wearing it today, I even added an ace bandage under it to help stabilize and keep it from destroying my thumb crotch, no dice. Don't waste the money if you're active at all.

  I have carpal tunnel on my left wrist and trigger finger on both my thumbs.  I got an Aircast wrist wrap/thumb stabilizer through my insurance company on the recommendation of my chiropractor. I also got a thumb splint for the other thumb. Both of these could onlly be worn at night because it's impossible to use your hands with either of them on. Middle of the night potty breaks were a real pain and very loud and hard as I peeled off my thumb splint to free my hand. I wanted something that was easier to use and that I could use all the time of I wanted to. I decided to try these. I was hesitant as there was only one review, but they looked like they would work well for me.I couldn't be happier! I have medium size hands and the fit is perfect. The thumb support keeps me from bending my thumb, but the tip is exposed enough that I can use it as normal. That's huge for me!  My wrist is stabilized perfectly as well. I was so pleased with it that I just ordered another one to wear on my other thumb at night.

  After having my first baby I developed ""mommy's thumb"". It's a real thing. My thumb and wrist hurt SO bad from holding my baby's head and the strain it was putting on my thumb. It became super painful and numb. I did some research and saw that other mom's bought something like this and decided to give it a try. Definitely helped keep my thumb stable and supported. I could still do things with this on and the pain went away completely in a couple weeks.

  I bought this brace a year ago for two problems.  Carpal tunnel and a really arthritic thumb (basal thumb arthritis.)  It's helped my hand so much!  If I forget to wear it and fall asleep really hard I wake up with a numb hand from bending at the wrist, which the brace prevents you from doing.  It also keeps my thumb somewhat immobile, so that I don't damage it by (unconsciously) squeezing my fist at night while asleep.  It's been a year, and I'm finally thinking it needs washing, so I looked at the packaging which instructs me to hand wash and line dry it.  I noticed it says it has anti-bacterial (""aegis"") shielding which must be what kept it from getting funky until this much time went by, which is amazing because my hands sweat quite a bit.  This product is so much better than the wrist braces that my insurance would cover (after hassling with getting a script for one from a doctor,) and for under 15 bucks it's a great value.  The velcro on the thumb is threatening to wear out, so I'm ordering a second one for back up, because I wouldn't want to ever be without this brace, and for the money it's worth it to have a second one even if I just misplace the original.  I don't find the velcro wearing out to be a negative because of all positive aspects of this brace, it's fairly cool and comfortable, it's got antimicrobial shielding, and it protects my hand from becoming a total mess when I'm asleep.  At my worst, before I had this brace, my hands were such a mess that just pulling my socks up would be very difficult and painful.  If I wanted to be really cheap, I think it would be possible to sew on new velcro.

  This would be a great brace, but there is a seam, that is heavily stitched, that sits right in the crook of your thumb and forefinger. It stabs in that spot. I tried on both my right and left hand and it did it either way. In 1/2 hour of wearing I had red, raw skin there. I had my husband try it before writing this review to see if it was just my hands. It was not. It was doing the same thing to him. Maybe it isn't always stitched there? I can't explain why there are so many positive reviews as this is unwearable for me.

  I purchased this because I had a synovial cyst removed and sometimes get pain in the wrist from my thumb moving. Overall for the price it is pretty decent. It is a little big for me. I am a petite female, so that doesn't surprise me. I wish the thumb portion was a bit stiffer. I wear this at night and notice that I can still move my thumb quite a bit. I also wish the material that goes around the top of my hand was tighter. It is very loose and while it is not uncomfortable, it might be a problem if I was wearing the brace during the day. It is super easy to change from R to L hand, you don't even have to move any straps. It is also easy to put on and off. It isn't too long/high on my wrist and hand, which was something I was looking for as my last one went halfway down my arm. It is non-irritating to wear and the material inside is soft, but it seems like it is sturdy enough to last a while. I give it only three stars because I wish it had more thumb stability.

  I bought these shorts not for exercising, but actually for the sole purpose to wear under dresses to help keep the dreaded chub rub at bay (you ladies with thick thighs know what I mean!!). To that end, they did their job! The shorts are soft and very stretchy, and as an added bonus they helped keep my belly under wraps as well as protect my thick thighs from chafing under the dress. You can‚Äôt tell I was wearing anything underneath. The size chart was right on point, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh about 200lbs, so I bought the XL and they fit perfect.

  These shorts are going to be part of my Summer 2018 anthem. I wore them for the first time during a 10K race (took a chance) and they served me well. The high waist keeps my tummy in place. The 8"" inseam is a comfortable length on my thighs - not too short or long. The legs didn't ride up either. The pockets were perfect for my big phone - a Samsung J7. Not once did my phone pop out. Perfect thickness of fabric - passed the squat test (not see-through when squatting). Several of my runner friends were interested in them for themselves. I immediately bought another pair in navy. I imagine I'll purchase a few more pairs as I train for my marathon.Update: I will officially be wearing these shorts for the Chicago Marathon. I've worn them all summer and they have held up every step of the way.

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and about 205 pounds carrying most of my weight in my tummy. I purchased and xxl based off of size chart.  I love that the waist goes above my belly button and holds in all of my muffin top and belly bulge.  Even when I am going on light jogs it stays up!!!! I almost never find myself adjusting and pulling them back up.  I use these several times a week during my workouts or when I‚Äôm deep cleaning. They are very comfortable.  Never left with a red mark around my waist. They are stretchy yet form fitting.  I will be purchasing more since I love the longer length (no chub rub with this length), non shiny fabric and the high waist (above be belly button).  However, I do get the tiny fabric balls on inner thigh area after a few times wearing them so I‚Äôm only giving them 3 stars. They start to shabby after several uses so while great for working out I wouldn‚Äôt wear these out and about in public unless brand new.

  Had already bought the Baleaf capris with the phone pocket and wanted to try the shorts.  Can't believe how many manufacturers are ignoring active women who need a spot for their phones!  So happy to discover Baleaf.  The pocket fit my iPhone 7 in its case and held it firmly against my upper outer thigh so there wasn't bouncing around and I didn't get chaffed. There was also a hidden pocket at the waist that could actually hold a key with fob, not just a single key.  Again, HOORAY and why don't more makers of activewear think of this?  How many people just run out the door with NOTHING when they go run, walk or bike?  I am 5'6"" and wear a size 8 comfortably and the medium fit the way I wanted.  It felt supportive and snug but nothing was tight.  I am a runner and appreciate that the legs of the shorts didn't ride up as I ran. Fabric was a good thickness, not at all see through.  I am a fan!

  I was looking for a bench that could handle the weight of a big guy and still fold up for compact storage. The FlyBird looks like it's going to do the job. I just took it out of the box today. Assembly took about three minutes because it only involved screwing on the foot pads.The bench initially wobbled on the flat floor but that was fixed as soon as I inserted the frame pin. I was very cautious to detect any instability because I am 6'2"" and 270 pounds. No squeaks or wobbles so far.The bench was due on Monday but showed up early on the preceding Friday. It was shipped via slow-boat UPS ground from CA to me in VA. The package arrived in good condition and packaged effectively. There wasn't a lot of trash to dispose of.Overall I am happy with this purchase. The price was good. The product seems to be good quality. I just hope that it lasts a while.

  This bench is great...good quality, sturdy, smooth operation and folds up nicely for easy storage. My only gripe is that it is just too tall.  Most weight benches are around 17-18"" high off the ground; this one is 21 inches.  May not seem like a lot but it makes for a feeling of instability when planting your feet on the floor or while lowering dumbbells.  If you don't mind resting your feet on the foot rests while exercising for stability then it's fine. Unfortunately the height was a deal breaker for me and I had to return it, which was a shame as I loved all the other factors of it.  For reference I am 6 feet tall. Also I've included two pictures of this bench and the one I ultimately ended up going with to give some perspective on the height.  The other bench in the picture is 17.5"" tall.

  Was looking for an adjustable bench for my home gym, and decided on this one - based on its features, favorable customer reviews and for a good price.  So far, i'm happy with the purchase.  Out of the box it was super easy to assemble. It's lightweight - light enough for my wife or son to move/re-position if needed, but sturdy and comfortable.  I've read some comments from 'bigger' guys - a lightweight bench probably isn't ideal for big guys.  I'm 5'9"", 170 lbs and have no issues.  One of the features i like most about the bench is the range of available adjustments. I was especially interested in the decline options.  Overall, this bench has been a great buy for me.

  Love how compact it is, can put it in a coat closet or really anywhere, I put mine in me garage in between the bikes that hang on the wall, look at the picture, you can barely find it. Light too. My only issue is that I am 5-11‚Äù and find that I want it to be slightly closer to the ground. It‚Äôs a little taller than most benches I have used. And I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the height and the fact that is light weight but I would be concerned if I was using a lot more weight that I might tip over. Maybe you could get some extensions for the feet to widen the base. Maybe it‚Äôs just me. Either way I still love not having to have a dedicated workout room.  The packs up so small so easily that you can take it out get your workout in anywhere in the house and put it in a closet or anywhere else when you‚Äôre done.

  This is a pretty sturdy workout bench. I've taken a picture of the various ways you can use this bench. Set up took less than 5 minutes. So far I've got no issues with it except when I do the sit up workout, my butt sticks out a bit at the end. This isn't an issue if I stick to crunches.One negative is the smell. It's got like a new bench smell that is pretty strong and doesn't go away. I've had this bench for a couple of months now and although it's mostly gone, I can still smell it a little.Overall I'm pretty happy with the bench.One note, the Styrofoam inside the box came half destroyed. Caused a huge mess in my room. If it's packed properly, this should not happen.*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.

  For as cheap as this was, I didn't expect the kind of quality I saw here.  And NO CONSTRUCTION was a total relief!  It folds up very nicely.  The only cautionary point I'd make is for anyone under 5.4' or so (although my girlfriend is 5'2"" and loves it) because this is one of their bigger benches out there.  For example, top of the cushion to the floor is about 19"", which means that most people will not be able to put their feet flat on the floor while doing say flies, but you can put your feet on the footrest.  On the upside, the bench is quite long, and it can easily support a 6.2' man for inclines.  For an all-around smaller bench that shorter folks would probably prefer, buy the ""FLYBIRD Adjustable Bench"" which is 2.5"" shorter to the top of the pad and a few inches shorter.  You'll love either one I'm sure.

  Ok. My friend came over and we were gonna play go fish and I was really excited because I had watched some youtube strategy videos and was looking forward to using my new skills (youtube is the BEST when it comes to learning new skills. Especially card games. )  I was SURE I was going to kick his ass, but I'm not gonna lie, this guy is good (I'm pretty sure he's the guy that uploaded all the skills videos, I know a pair of hands when I see them ;) but seriously. And then I was like, ""Jared, did you make a bunch of youtube videos for go fish strategy""? and HE said. ""no.""  Yeah right).  I also know a liar when I see one, kinda like my hand noticing thing.  So, he wanted to use his deck, but I just got this fresh bicycle set off of amazon so I pulled rank on that argument. I'll admit, his deck was pretty dope, a harry potter set, but I get really triggered by Dumbledore (To be clear, i don't DISLIKE Dumbledore. He's amazing. It just makes me sad because... well you know... and if you don't I don't want to spoil it, but he dies.)  So anyways, we're in the thick of it, asking for cards left and right.  I was like ""Jared, do you have any sixes?"" I was nice about it, of course.  Hostility doesn't get you far in competitions ;).  Then he said ""no"".  But I needed sixes. Bad times. But thats life. Long story short, I ended up losing that round. (I was going for sixes...i should have known). GET THIS. after, and ONLY after, jared won that round he casually mentioned to me that my deck (the red one) was missing the six of hearts. I dont even know where to start. First of all, how in the world did he know that?? He MUST be the youtube guy I just know it! I would NEVER notice - even if it was a joker missing!!  At first I thought he was pulling a Dumbledore on me.  But then I realized that it was for real, the six of hearts was missing.  I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF BOTH BIYCLE CARDS AND AMAZON FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS. Am I upset that I lost? Yes.  Am I upset that I misplaced my trust in full, complete decks of cards? Yes.  Am I upset that Dumbledore is dead?  Yes, and, spoiler alert. He's dead. I hope you did not read that part about him dying.  Especially if you are a harry potter fan and also didn't know that Dumbledore is dead. Thats why I said spoiler alert. It's so sad. I would not buy this deck of bicycle cards, especially if you plan on playing someone as talented as Jared at go fish. So anyways, you get it. three stars. But the blue pack was immaculate. Pretty much the best deck of cards ive ever laid my hands on. Three stars.RIP Dumbledore.*Spoiler alert*

  So disappointed! I grew up playing w/Bicycle brand cards for years! Always loved the quality, weight, texture and material. Our home was destroyed by toxic mold and I missed my cards so my husband splurged and specifically ordered this brand. Material is thin & feels like some type of plastic or something with a weird material with a tiny cross hatched pattern to them, I'm assuming in an attempt to make them slippery but it doesn't help. They are way more slippery than old decks, even brand new, used to be. Hard to even shuffle them. So, unfortunately, like many other companies, Bicycle has followed suit (pun intended) and opted for cheaper materials. Makes me sad, especially when much of the reason people play with""real"" cards is for the feel & texture of them in their hands. I get it, cheaper materials=making more money. Just unfortunate, especially with some where ""the feel"" matters so much. I'm disappointed Bicycle!

  Yes, I can buy this set for $1.00 less at a brick & mortar store, but that also means masking up and worrying that I don't catch COVID in the process. Speaking of COVID, we've played a lot of cards with our kids in the last 8 months and expect to play more. Thus, getting a pair of new decks was essential. We split one into a Euchre deck and the other will be for cribbage. I grew up in the Windsor, Ontario, area when the Bicycle cards were made in our area. These are the same cards I played with as a kid. Nothing has changed. They are crisp. The finish is excellent, the weight is perfect, the lettering and prints are sharp. The 13 yr old can shuffle them with ease and even the 10 yr old is able to give it a try. I wouldn't play with any other cards. 5 stars.

  I recently moved and had to sell my bench and squat rack due to size constraints (a 1.5-2k $ set up). I somewhat begrudgingly bought a cheap power tower and these bands. I was actually really surprised that this cheap setup allowed me to reliably do similar workouts to what I was able to do before with the added benefit of being super cheap and easy to move. It is NOT as a good as an actual gym. But it does allow you to get a decent workout on the cheap. The carabiners are not great quality and are sort of annoying to get into the fabric loops. These could be easily replaced but its not like 150lbs is going to break them anyway. It would also be nice to be able to order single additional bands. Overall I recommend these. I spent less than 300$ on these, a power tower (city birds), and a large mat and I feel like I have a decent home gym that I could easily progress on and move around.

  I'm a 280 pound, former high school lineman so I need good resistance. I prefer free weights but these Resistance Bands are GREAT for when you can't hit the free weights. These bands are very convenient since all you need is a door that shuts. Pop the included door anchor above your door or along the side with hinges and close the door, then you're ready to rock out multiple exercises. Bands offer great range and resistance. I was a little worried when I put all the bands together and started chest exercise but the bands (and thankfully the anchor AND my door) held firm.Only complaint... the black straps can rub against the body and the carabiners are a little too small for my big fingers but it's not that big of a deal.Got in a great workout without evening leaving the bedroom.If you're looking for resistance bands, these will make her dance.

  If you are in the fitness industry, clearly you know all your equipments limitations (unlike the idiots who had commented on this product). This is an unbiased review- just in case. The issue is that I almost not buy these because of the comments on this. But I took the risk because I had a similar set a long time ago- I lost in a moving.With these I have been able to build muscle fatigue at the end of each workout making sure that pump stays in. I have been able to do double grip rows, donkey kicks, hip extensions and single-arm flys (hooking one end on a loop available on a sissy squat machine I have).  On weight drops I always rely on unlatching the 10‚Äôs or 20‚Äôs.#greatproducts #3months of use

  Had my yeti for about a year but wanted to not have to unscrew a lid every time i wanted a drink. I bought my husband a yeti for Christmas and got us both one of these lids. Very convenient, you can pop up the straw with one hand, and i love that it still has a handle too. Came with 2 straws that you have to trim, but that was an easy fix. They have a ruler on the packaging that's fairly accurate.

1,SPORTS,YETI Bottle Straw Cap for Rambler Bottles,$12.98,5,"
  I was looking for something to make it easier to drink my water while working out and generally eliminate the awkward squeak I get sometimes when I'm opening and closing the top in class. I found this and it works perfectly! I've been using it for about 3 months now and it works incredibly. I've wanted an alternative to my Camelbak for a while because I like the insulation (no sweating!), but I was disappointed to trade insulation for a straw. Luckily, this saved the day. It does leak sometimes if it's been overfilled, but I've learned where too much water is and that issue has gone away. I use it on my 26oz no problem. Cutting the straw to size was very easy. I really recommend this if you're looking for a straw lid for your Rambler.

  I got this for my Yeti Rambler (growler) to make it easier to drink from.  This top works well, is easy to clean and take apart for cleaning. The only downfall is that the beverage inside the rambler does get warmer faster with this top on verses the having original top installed.  So now instead of opening up the rambler a day or 2 later with ice still clinking around like it does with the original top on, the beverage is still just cool the next day (not a big deal).  So if you drink a lot or empty the rambler in one day it shouldn't make a difference to you.  If you use it as a growler for beer I wouldn't recommend storing the beer in it with this top on it for more than a day.

  This straw lid (can use without straw too) has made my 18 oz Yeti Rambler my favorite water bottle! Flips open with ease, sturdy construction, handle is ergonomic and it screws on so easily as compared to the standard lid! Great for yard work! I cannot express how satisfied I am. Is it OK to get excited over this lid ? ... Yeah it‚Äôs OK

  Really great game. Great for kids 6 years through adults. great extended family fun.Great bonding tool. Gets kids off iPad.

  Purchased these as a gift for my brother who is at a different stage of life than my own. They seem to get a ton of use when he has parties/gatherings/a drunk friend over.I purchased this a year ago and waited to see how it held up before leaving the review. They‚Äôve been stored outside in San Diego since last Christmas (2017!). They haven‚Äôt color faded in this SoCal sun which is pretty impressive.We don‚Äôt get much weather variety, so the wood has stayed in good condition. Honestly, except for a couple teeth marks from his puppy, they‚Äôve really maintained their form.They‚Äôre perfect size, not too tiny where you‚Äôre like ‚Äúwtf, I feel like I got misled and ripped off!‚Äù And they aren‚Äôt oversized where you‚Äôre like ‚Äúokay, this is embarrassing and making my yard look small.‚Äù They‚Äôre also very durable and visually pleasing (for what they are).Absolutely would recommend.

  I bought these when they went on sale. I like to put things in my cart and if they go down in price, then I buy it before it goes back up. My grandson who is 5 had a great time this weekend playing this with us. Also I had him help me add up the points just to work on his math. I like to incorporate a little learning whenever I can without the stress of him feeling pressured.  It's a great game for hand and eye coordination. And teaching good sportsmanship.  We will be playing everytime he comes over for a visit. Going to look for more games that are physical and mental like this one, to play with him in his visits.

  I gave this as Christmas gift to my daughter and I was so disappointed with it. The day we got, one of the stick broke. The quality was so poor. The price i paid doesn't seems to justify the quality of product at all. We havent even started playing it and i just set it up and placed on ground that a ball roll over and broke one stick. it didnt hit it directly it just rolled over it and stick got broke. my daughter started crying a lot as her new toy broke even before she could play with it. to calm her down we just played on 4 of the remaining sticks. it does look like a fun game. thats why I am giving 2 stars to it.i wish i had a replacement stick with it. They should send 1-2 stick etc with it anyways as its quality is not that great.I have edited the rating just because this is 1st time it has happened to me that a merchant has refunded the amount based on a reviews. I didn't want the refund as I was not aware that merchant will refund the amount. As I said the game is surly fun to play with whole family.

  It was easy to put together but one of the pegs would not go in due to the hole not having groves for it to screw into so my husband had to screw it in,  After that the peg made the groves so it as easy to put together.

  This was so easy to assemble that my 6 year old granddaughter put it together. The rope rings are sturdy and work well. The plastic rings are useless. I ordered a separate set of 10 rope rings because the plastic rings were useless. Even with that, I gave this game five stars because it is fun to play for all ages, young and old.In the summer time, you can play it on your lawn or at a park. When the weather gets rainy and cold, it can be played indoors.The case that it comes with is very nice because it fits all parts compactly.

  Updated: I had recieved a defective item, but within a day of posting my review I was contacted by customer service, who very promptly sent out a replacement (arrived in two days with Sunday delivery) that works perfectly.  Thank you for the great customer service.  it is much appreciated!  If you have the slightest problem with this item, contact Elite directly ASAP.  They are super friendly and helpful. Changed to full stars.  The kids love this game!We really wanted to love this one, as my child specifically asked for a ring toss game for a birthday party.  It looks great, and the handy tote is a great selling point for it.  Plus it's the perfect size for young players.  However, after we set it up for the kids to play with I noticed that is was a little wonky, with two of the pegs sticking out at odd angles. I asked the kids to give me a minute to fix it, thinking it was a slipped thread on the rods and it would be quick and easy to unscrew and screw back together properly.  The first rod came off easily, but I couldn't really get it back on perfectly straight.  Moving on to the second rod, I quickly noticed it was jammed.  I gave it another twist, and the rod came off, but without the threaded part at the bottom. It had snapped right off.  Upon closer inspection, the holes on one plank had been mis-threaded, causing the rods to jam up when screwed together.  Had I left well enough alone, the kids would have at least gotten a day out of it, but once it broke that was it for the game.It really was a shame, as my first impression after receiving the game in the mail was that this would be perfect for our party, and figured I would just keep it handy in the trunk for other family events and such.

  I hope you can see in the photo that the 1 yr old strap (top) is about twice as thick as the new junk they sent me (bottom). Is the price half of what the originals cost since I'm getting half the material?? NO in fact I paid MORE for less! The photo doesn't do it nearly the justice of seeing and feeling them in person. No comparison from old to new, old ones were quality and new ones are trash. Needless to say these have been returned....Just as an FYI I've been using this brand of straps for YEARS! I'll never Waste another cent on anything Harbinger sells and hope this helps others save their hard earned money.When these first arrived and I took them from the packaging I thought they were counterfeit knockoffs. So I called the company direct and sent them photos via email of what I received alongside of the ""same ones"" I had bought about a year ago that clearly show the new corner cutting cheap garbage are about half the thickness. They won't last and because they're much thinner they will painfully dig into the wrist. The best part is after numerous emails and photos  ( I believed they hoped I'd let it go ) they write me back telling me the ""gloves"" are now made thinner for a better feel. That's funny since the entire time we were talking about the STRAPS and they had my photos that they claimed to have sent to their ""Product Development Team"" and came back with that bogus excuse. Needless to say I wrote them back letting them know we were talking about STRAPS not gloves and never heard back (Shocking). Save your money and buy a different a brand so you'll get what you paid for...

  Huge downgrade from the previous manufactured straps and I am very disappointed. With this downgrade of less material and or weaves, you lose comfort and durability. From further inspection it looks like they removed the edge seam as shown in the pics to cut cost. I've been purchases harbinger products since the 90s and this is the first time I've lost trust in them. I've would've gladly payed more to get back that quality from the original straps. Bring back the old quality!

  Great straps - love the padding - super soft right from the packaging. Didn't need much breaking in. Straps had me deadlifting an extra 50lbs on the first use.I'm a female, 5'2"", athletic but small wrists - fit great didn't need any alterations or cutting of fabric/padding either. Awesome right outta the box - highly recommend if you're looking for straps. Also the color is great cause it's a deep/rich pink which is recognizable and distinct but not obnoxiously girly... cause you know women care about those things ;).

  Thanks to these lifting straps, I was able to hit a new deadlift PR! I‚Äôve always used my hand, no gloves for grip and constantly felt like I was dropping the bar because I have small hands. These straps made me feel like I had that bar and could keep it up! Omg in love with these! Strongly recommend for anyone avoiding gloves but wanting the secure hold!

  This is my first pair of lifting straps, and so far I'm happy with them. MAKE SURE TO WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS on how to use these properly. Not just Harbinger videos but some other brands as well. Make sure the ""lose"" end on both hands goes towards your thumb (which means there will be a ""left"" and a ""right"" one after you pull the strap through the loop). Also make sure to watch the video where they show you how to tighten them using the ""motorcycle grip"" (i.e. pinching and turning forward with your thumb).I purchased these for two reasons. First of all, I dislocated my finger recently, so it was hurting to lift (especially in pulling motions, like pull-ups or rows). I wanted something to help with the grip while my hand recovers. I am also finding that as my deadlifts are getting heavier, my hands/wrists are giving out before my legs do, so while I do want to develop grip strength, I simply was robbing my lefts of the extra reps I could've done were it not for the hands.I'm yet to try heavy deadlifts (waiting for the finger to heal), but the straps did help with my back/biceps workout in terms of reducing strain on the wrist and allowing my to do pullups, rows, etc., without having my sore finger/wrist stopping me.I did not feel any discomfort that some folks are complaining about. I thought the straps are fine. My skin is pretty tough though, so maybe if you have gentle skin you may be uncomfortable. I was totally fine.I look forward to using these with my heavy deadlifts to see how well they work. Overall, looking at the material used for the straps, I expect them to last for a while. Hopefully the padding will stay attached as well, that's my only concern.

  These work great. Simple and strong. I use them while doing front squats--my wrist flexibility isn't good enough to do it with the ""hook grip"" you use for a clean+jerk, so I instead wrap these and grip them. It helps hold the bar no matter how slick my sweaty shoulders get. As you'd expect/hope with lifting straps, they're also easily tossed into a gym bag to take everywhere. The added padding on the inside is nice, but I don't actually use them in that way, so I can't remark on that functionally. My favorite part is the color. I wear pink converse while lifting, so these make me feel like an adorable coordinated BEAST.
"
1,SPORTS,Harbinger Padded Cotton Lifting Straps with NeoTek Cushioned Wrist (Pair),$8.99,5,"
  My grip strength was lagging behind my deadlift weight so I decided to try out straps. Bought a pair for my work out partner as well because it was cheap.I do over-over grip because over-under I felt imbalances. Sure I won't be lifting huge numbers with over-over, but I am not a competitive power lifter and have no need for a 600 lb+ deadlift. My grip was going at 315 lb, but with the straps it made for easy lifting.  It is a good size for me and the padding around the wrist gives me comfort. So far I have no issues with it and would recommend for price and value.

  got the paw patrol ones as reward for potty training, not for 1st aid purposes.  They seem like regular bandaids and stick fairly well.  However,  the pictures are not aligned.  See my posted picture.  My daughter didn't seem to mind so i didnt bother to return them.  But they should do better quality control, especially for children products cuz some kids get real anal about everything being perfect.

  I  gave one to my daughter and kept one for myself. The grandkids ( I-, 2-, and 4-years old) spend more time falling on their faces than they do on their feet. Their Mom has a rule that there must be blood in order to use a Band Aid. I only had dumb ones at my house and one of those cute babies wanted one. She looked through all of mine and tried a couple on, then said she really didn't need any! She broke my heart! That's when I decided to get Paw Patrol. She won't stick her nose up at Grandma's first aid next time :)

  As a mom (NOT a medical expert) I try to always have a box of character Band-Aids like this around for small incidents. The two sizes included aren't perfect for every possibility, but cover most simple childhood scrapes. I find that for most situations, these are just sticky enough so that they don't fall off too easily, but aren't too traumatic to remove. And of course the characters (in this case, Paw Patrol) provide some real benefit in terms of soothing and distracting a hurt child. Your only issue might be a child wanting to wear them as stickers when they aren't needed!These probably aren't the ONLY bandages you'll ever need in your first aid kit; I like having a wider range of sizes and some waterproof ones for different situations. But as a mom, I think these are a great basic for soothing and protecting the most common little kid incidents.

  Even when you are not dealing with a cut, scrap or skin burn... you have to have one of these Band-Aids.  The characters are so fun and the Band-Aids are so colorful.  They come in a cute little box and young children cannot resist them.  They stick on ok and do the job but lets be honest... they're stickers not for wounds.  If I didn't put them on the tip top shelf of the medicine cabinet the box would last less than a day.  They don't seem to be very waterproof nor do they stick very well.  But children also play and relocate them on their bodies considering every little minor injury needs a paw patrol Band-Aid asap!  Compared to cloth or medical grade ones these aren't nearly as good.  However, they make the pain to away and put a smile on their face.  For anything serious we will stick to the heavy duty less attractive ones but for small cuts and scrapes my FSA will buy me these to turn frowns upside down.

  I purchased these for the price but not even worth that to me. I had a cut on my arm and i used this bandaid after a while i started ro itch on the corner of the bandaid (not even where the cut was) i ignored the itching. Once i removed the band i saw it had left a pink rash on my skin and bumps. I somehow thought it was just me and put a new one on. A few minutes later started to itch once again. I removed it and just threw them all away. After removing itch went away.

  My 3 year old loves these. He got poked by a blackberry thorn pretty good. It was a tiny poke but must have hit just the right spot on his finger because it was dripping blood everywhere. I think he was more freaked out by the blood than the actual poke. Anyway, I pulled out one of these and he stopped crying instantly. So naturally I bought 3 more boxes. :)

  We've been using this all summer...it's been left in the pool in the elements...and it's as good as the day it came 2 1/2 months ago. We used a pump to inflate. We flip it over when not in use, so the holes don't get water in them and mildew forms. A little pink mildew starts anyway, so I just spray with foaming beach every now and then.This thing is exactly as advertised. It's very sturdy! It's fun and challenging.

1,SPORTS,"Trideer Extra Thick Yoga & Exercise Ball, 5 Sizes Ball Chair, Heavy Duty to Support 2200lbs, for Balance, Stability, Pregnancy and Physical Therapy, Quick Pump Included",$18.99,5,"
  I'm going to be perfectly straightforward on this review and share things I don't like to normally share. I am 5'3"", and around 400 lb. Thyroid problem. I'm trying to lose weight so don't judge please. I also have massive thighs. I thought because I was so heavy I should get the extra large ball. The one that tops out at 75 cm because I figured my weight would squish it down enough to where I could use it as an office chair and then exercise on it during my lunch break. Don't do that. Follow the chart and get the ball corresponding to your height and not your weight because you can always make the ball a little firmer but you can't make it smaller. My legs are short and I practically have to climb onto this thing to sit on it and the only way I can keep my feet grounded is to straddle and it is still very comfortable sitting in front of my desk but I have absolutely no way to move it without having to climb off and then climb back on. My husband is a few inches taller than me so I'm going to give him this one for his gaming room and I ordered the smaller size. Also the foot pump is way more awesome than a hand pump cuz you do get a work out but it does take a little while so if you have a little air compressor (I have an AirHawk) I literally filled the ball in a fraction of the time. Seriously. I highly recommend using something else if you have it but if anything the foot pump is vastly superior to the hand pumps that the other brands offer. I'm sitting on this thing right now and bouncing on it like crazy and it's taking everything I'm giving it. I will not post a picture because I'm a little embarrassed of my size right now ( I gained quite a bit away in a couple years after my thyroid gave out and I don't like where I'm at right now and that's why I'm trying to lose weight. I've never been a little girl but I've never been this big either) but this thing is taking all I am dishing out and I'm bouncing pretty hard on it I did my research and I'm very pleased with this brand and this ball I just need one a little smaller. Looking forward to tightening some muscles and not hurting my hips sitting in an office chair all day long. I also very much enjoy the color selection.

  The ball itself works well and is very comfortable to sit on.  Im currently 9 months pregnant and it really takes away my pelvic pain!  I got the biggest ball they had which worked great for me because I'm a tall woman I'm 6ft1in. The only complaint I have is the ball itself came with some scuff marks on it which to me is tacky.Update!The seller sent me a new ball for no charge! It shows me that they care about the customers! The new ball I got was perfect!

  Leaks air. Pump it up, use it....then pump it again. Cannot find a hole to patch or fix. It just... leaks air somehow. Maybe i got a dud.UPDATE: The company has replaced the ball. I did, indeed, have a dud. The replacement is exactly was i was hoping for. I filled it up the first time, used it for a week, then filled it the rest of the way (allows the material to finish stretching after being squished down to fit in the box). i am completely satisfied with this ball, and will recommend it for everyone needing one.The multiple sizes are great for a variety of activities. The box includes a pump so there is no need to go out and buy one. The material is non-slip, so the ball stays put on my wooden floors, and my bottom doesn't slide off.All in all? One of the best purchases i've ever made.

  I purchased this ball for use in my office at work.  Between work, school, and driving I sit 4/5 of my day, so I chose to try an exercise ball as a way of alleviating some minor back and hip pain.  I am 5'6"" and about 250lb so I was really torn as to which size to choose.  My legs are short but I'm a hefty girl so I wasn't sure if I should stay with the size for my height or move up a size to comply with my weight.  I eventually chose the 75cm based on other reviews and  I could not be happier!!  The instructions to inflate were a little hazy, which is my only complaint, but I managed using other reviews and the Q&A section on Amazon.  They talk about inflating the ball to the 'mark', then waiting 24 hours and inflating it a second time.  There is no clear direction about where the 'mark is'.  They give you a paper strip of measuring tape but it is not marked, so that's where I was confused.  What they meant (assuming I finally understood it correctly) was to use the measuring tape to measure out the indicated size of your ball (mine was 75cm) and mark it on a wall or something (I used a yardstick).  Then inflate the ball until the top of the ball hits the mark that YOU made.  Then wait 24 hours then inflate it again.  Like I said, a little confusing, but once it's explained it's super easy.  I figured it out and now I've been using the ball for a little more than a week and am thrilled.  I love the color (I bought the Turkis, which is sort of a fun turquoise) and it's super durable.  I've gotten so many compliments!  It's pretty heavy weight and while I was a little hesitant to put all of my weight on it at first, now I bounce and roll around for hours at a time with no trouble!My back and hips are feeling much better, even after a short time, and I find myself moving around a lot more (being active, not rolling off of it!) than I did before in my rolling office chair.  I highly recommend this product but wish the instructions were more clear.

  Lasted from August 19th-October 24th- updating my review to show the power in customer service. After finding out my yoga balls were not returnable, I was a bit bummed.  I‚Äôm currently using these yoga balls in my 3rd grade classroom for flexible seating.  After one ball started showing signs of leaking and constant pumping back up, I submitted my review to show the time frame of one of my flawed yoga balls.  The company contacted me immediately, and to my surprise sent me two new balls to tryout with my students.  They absolutely will be thrilled to see their favorite yoga ball back in the classroom!! Thank you- the power of customer service...

  I bought these in white and black.  I cannot say enough about these socks.  I purchased them because my foot and ankle had become very swollen and after wearing them for just a day, the swelling was gone.  I decided to continue wearing them every day and I must say that my feet no longer hurt and my legs do not tire out the way they used to.  Anyone who is on their feet (nurses, cashiers, bank tellers...anyone) all day will find that these socks dramatically lessens your daily discomfort.  Even if you don't think you are experiencing discomfort, you will know it once you try these socks and feel so much better.  I now have 9 pair and when they need to be replaced, I will only purchase these socks and only  from this vendor.About the vendor....I had an issue with my order because instead of 6 socks (3 full pairs) arriving, 5 arrived.  Things happen and especially now with the Christmas/Holiday rush on.  So, I wrote them and didn't expect to hear anything for a few days but the next day I had an email explaining how sorry they were and that they were sending me 2 pairs of the socks to replace the one sock that was missing.I must say, in case you don't know, these are truly compression socks.  They do not slide right on your foot and up your leg, you have to work them but that is what you want.  They are meant to be worn while you are active so don't sleep in them.  I purchased a man's L/XL because I am overweight and have always had a very wide foot 8W.  At 5'4"", these socks are a bit long for me, but I am happy with the fit...I just fold it over (knee sock style) at the top.I've bought some for my very tall sisters-in-law for Christmas.  They are on their feet 8 hours per day and probably don't even know they need these...oh, they need them for sure.Care:  I just pop them in the washer and dryer and they come out good as new.  I wouldn't use any oxygenated detergent or cleaners with them as that type of product attacks spandex/elastic and the compression aspect of the sock will soon disappear.

  I have some problems with edema when I'm on my feet too long. I substitute teach and on those days especially, my ankles swell. I bought these in the hopes that they would give me support and improve circulation and thus the edema and they worked perfectly this past week. I was on my feet two days in a row and when I returned home after 8 hours, my ankles were their normal size.

  So I wear a size 8 1/5 to 9 in shoes with large cakes so I ordered the l/xl. These worked out great, BUT they took the swelling in my legs and feet down so much that they are now too big. I just ordered the small/medium and they fit perfectly. My circulation has improved tremendously.

  So, with too much time working at my desk, I now have a need for compression socks.  I was very fortunate to come across these, and, after ordering the first set of three (yes, three, for only ten bucks!), I liked them so much I wound up buying 3 more sets, so I have them to wear all week.They are a ""starter"" level of compression, so it was a good beginning for me, and, although it took a bit of getting used to, I have to say I like compression socks now.  Kind of feel like a superhero, haha.The fit on these is outstanding, and my legs and feet feel great, even after a full day at the office.  I like that they are thin, so they fit nicely in my shoes.  As far as the copper bit, according to research, copper has no therapeutic benefit, although it does fight odor.  I keep my feet very clean so that's not an issue, although it's always nice to add another layer for sweet smelling feet.  But, on the compression side, these are effective and definitely are helping my feet and legs be more comfortable.They are holding up well in the wash so far and no holes, rips or tears in daily use.  Apparently compression socks should be replaced very 3 or 4 months so the compression factor doesn't decrease due to normal wear, but, at ten bucks for three pairs, these are frankly on par with just regular socks, which have gone up in price, but down in quality.  Hard to even find decent regular athletic socks anymore.Given that it's summer now, and the weather is crazy hot, I actually have switched to a crew length compression sock from ADLU (sold on Amazon) because these socks, with shorts, render a lederhosen look, of which I'm not a fan, but I can still wear these at home or when sleeping.To up the therapeutic effect, I invested in the much more expensive (20 bucks for ONE pair) Wanderlust compression socks (more compression) and they are also awesome, super comfy and a lot more padding.  But, I think it's too much padding, and will make my shoes too tight, so I will likely stick with these, especially at this great price, and use the Wanderlust socks just for sleeping.  Seems it's good to have a mix of compressions anyway, and, even though these are lower, it's still enough compression, according to research, to have a positive effect in promoting blood circulation.In any event, these were a big win for me.  Excellent product at a fantastic price.

  I hesitated making this purchase because it's simply hard to judge fit when you are buying online.  However, after reading all the reviews, I felt confident enough to buy these compression socks.  My husband loves them!  He is completely sedentary and these socks are so much more comfortable and easier to put on than others he's had.  They look more masculine than the traditional while compression socks and they do keep the swelling down.  He says he is so much more comfortable now, sleeping better, etc.  I'll be buying more of these.

  I have ordered these balls for my students at the end of the year, for the last three years. This was the first year I was very disappointed. First, I didn't receive all of my order and didn't think to count the balls before I passed them out. Never had to before. My husband ordered a couple packs on his account since he had a credit, and then I decided to order two more for my PM class as well on my account... same vendor. Was so glad that some students didn't show the last day of school or I would have been short.Of the balls I did receive, unfortunately, some students had a pin hole in their balls and their autographs shrunk as their balls deflated. Was expecting 48 balls. Can't explain how I was short 14. Had I at least had the extra, I could have replaced the ones with holes.

  This is a quality bat and ball set.  It is plastic but the thicker type that has a bit of weight to it. Our kindergarten grandson told us this summer that he needed more bats so had a choice like the real baseball players and he needed them to be different sizes and shapes.  So being good grandparents, we ordered some bats and balsl. This set was immediately  his favorite.  He says that he is a better ball player with it and can hit the ball farther.  We are practicing both with a T and pitching.  Even the older kids usually choose this bat over others. Now he says we should have just purchased a few of this kind since they are the best. We can easily recommend this set.

  Glad to have found these Blitzballs. My Shepard puppy Max loves the sound of the ball when it comes off that bat (that popping or wack sound). He hard charges out in the field and brings it back for a session of keepaway.  But what surprised me more was the fact that he doesn't  try to destroy it. Happy to have it in his mouth with light chomps. So it's a win win for us. They go far, they are easy on his mouth, he gets a great workout and they last.  Thanks Blitzball!

  The bat came a bit smashed on the bottom handle, so probably not very sturdy. It is plastic after all. The ball is interesting because it's not perfectly round and this probably allows for kids to hit it pretty far. I have a four year old daughter and she hits the ball pretty far for her age for her first time ever. Her first hit was probably 15 feet in the air. She also smacked the ball on three occasions about 20 feet. I'm not so sure the bat will hold up after time, but in the mean time I'm sure this ball and bat will do just fine for my 4-year-old.

  Not worth the money. The net pole cracked the moment it was staked into the ground and a string broke on the net. The volleyball was thinner than a ball you buy at the store. The shuttlecocks broke apart after 2 games and were warped so they did not fly properly. We really tried to make it work. Unfortunately we ordered it for a party that got rained out and by the time it was opened it was too late to return, so frustrating!

  Junk. Save your money. Assembly instructions were not clear, but my husband and I were able to figure out how to put it up based on logic. Worked great for about an hour. Then as soon as someone ran into it, the pole broke. The poles are cheaply built and not sturdy at all. They aren't very stable in the ground. Horrible quality. I saw that it got mixed reviews before I bought, but honestly I didn't want to spend a lot of money and all of the high rated sets I found were pricey. Just looking for an inexpensive set for the kids to play in the backyard and for the occasional party. This set didn't even last one day. Not worth it.

  It's very cheaply built. The net itself isn't very wide and the poles are short. We will replace the poles. The net already had a snag in it when we opened it up and I can tell it won't last long. The birdies were both bent so we bought new ones as well. The ball it comes with much smaller than a normal volleyball, so we will have to get a new one. It's got a lot of lines to stake down for bracing the poles which is nice. The racquets are nice, and it will all serve it's purpose for a little while, but if we had older kids they would have been super disappointed in the size of everything.

  Poor quality and materials. The net on a volley ball court is supposed to be about seven and a half to eight feet high. The plastic poles that came are not even long enough once set in the ground. Poles are flimsy, ball is cheap badminton birds were flattened in packaging. Franklin normally has much better quality. As a matter of fact I bought a second Franklin ball at wally world for 5 bucks and it is far superior in quality.We bought this as a yard game for a BBQ and probably will seldom use it. But for me to have to go buy another ball and poles just to make sure it could be used one weekend is pretty bad. Fault is on the manufacture not the seller. I bought this based on what Franklin sells at wally world.

  The only reason I gave this a 2 on assembly was because they didn‚Äôt send 2 of the 6 poles to put it together! We played 2 times and 1 racket fell apart ( the head of it) it‚Äôs hollow handle rackets. It‚Äôs very cheaply made. Contacted company and they are suppose to send other 2 poles. We will see if they arrive. Wish I would have bought a sturdier set. Update: 2 weeks later and they have failed to send my piles that didn‚Äôt come in the box. Or replace the rackets that were broken after 2 uses! So upset that I wasted my money!

1,SPORTS,Speedo Unisex-Adult Swim Cap Silicone,$9.99,2,"
  My last Speedo silicone cap lasted 9 years!  (The Amazon product page says I bought this model in 2009.)I swim at least 4 hours a week in the sunlight.  Now that is durability!  Of course I ordered the same model when it finally ripped last week.I just received the new one and was so sad to discover that this cap is no where near as thick as it once was.  It also no longer has the textured inner surface.  This cap is inferior and shouldn't even be advertised as the same model.  No wonder there are now so many reviews describing the things ripping soon after purchase.Speedo may think it's profitable to spend less on the products, thus causing them to wear out quicker and thus selling more?  They did the same with their goggles and suits.  I moved on to Aqua Sphere and TYR for those respectively over the years and now I will look to another brand for caps.

  I do not like getting my hair wet when I am swimming (I get the irony) so I do not swim often. I purchased this cap after reading reviews that it kept hair mostly dry.

  I like these Speedo silicone swim caps. I have a few in different colors and they last forever. They're nice and thick so they feel sturdy and like they won't rip apart when placed on one's head. I have long thick hair and easily place them on my head. They feel good on and I never have to readjust them. This purple color is very pretty in person (much darker in the photo). I recently purchased it to match a new Speedo, workout bathing suit with purple straps. I've attached a photo if interested in seeing a better version of the purple color. I recommend these to any swimmer 100%.

  I have fine hair but a lot of it. This worked well when my hair was just below the shoulder. It stayed on my head and my hair stayed mostly dry.My hair is a couple inches longer now and this isn't working well at all. The cap begins to pull up off my head at the end of a single 20yd pool length, and after a tenth of a mile my hair is entirely wet.The quality of the material is good. For fine hair, this will not pull at you. I wash it inside out and dry it after each use. However, I often grown my hair 6-8 inches below my shoulder. That's what I consider long hair. This cap is no good for that.

I am not a weak person but I could not take apart the hoop sections at all, no matter how hard I pressed on the button spot.

  This was such a good purchase! I wanted a way to get exercise at home that was also something I would enjoy, and I heard that hula hooping could be a good waist trainer, so I thought a weighted one was a good idea. Assembly is very easy, the only thing is I personally have to move the foam exterior to press the buttons when I'm taking it apart, which isn't really that big of a deal. I ended up cutting my nails because when you're starting out trying to learn to hula hoop and you have to constantly grab and re-spin the hoop, it is very easy to stick long nails into the foam and damage it. With practice I was able to improve my hooping skills in one day, but I highly recommend starting out slow, because I hooped for 60 minutes one night and my hip was pretty bruised, which is completely on me. I love the option to adjust the size, because some people need more room and some don't have as much.  I can't say how effective it is exercise-wise since I really just started, but I'll make sure to update- so far I think it's worth it!

  This sleeve is not like other sleeves. I should know, I‚Äôve gone through most of them. I have been suffering from plantar fasciitis for about a year and as I work on my feet all day this has been a very distressing problem for me. I got help from a specialist who helped me with exercises and I‚Äôve tried a bunch of different insoles and foot supports. Some of these helped a bit but the pain was still bad and it started to affect the way I walked. I finally bit the bullet and brought this because of the good reviews, and I‚Äôm very glad I did. This ankle brace has helped me so much with my pain, it‚Äôs not too bulky like other ones I‚Äôve tried that won‚Äôt even fit in my shoe. This brace gives support but still thin enough to not cause issues or discomfort. The extra support strap provided was novel to me, it was so easy to adjust the tightness and it provided heavenly support to the bottom heel area. I just woke up after working three days straight with only a niggle at the base of my foot, I could cry from happiness! I've also got slim feet and ankles so I thought it would be too loose like other ones I‚Äôve tried, but that wasn‚Äôt the case as the design of the material of the strap appears to be supportive whatever the stretch without sagging. It also appears to have the ability to hold up for quite some time if it‚Äôs taken care of..Also worth mentioning, when I first received the brace it had a slight defect on the velcro, it did function as normal however so it didn‚Äôt really bother me. The company contacted me after a few days asking about my buyer experience and my thoughts about the product, I let them know about the defect and they immediately sent me out a brand new one, without me having to return the first one to save me the hassle of the return process. The level of customer service from sleeve stars was extraordinary and very rare these days. I would certainly recommend both the product and the company and wish that all companies dealt with their customers so well as they do. Without a doubt one of the best online purchases I‚Äòve made and sleeve stars are setting the standards for online customer service.

  Broke my ankle 2 years ago and just began training for a half marathon. My ankle immediately felt better when I put this on. Fit well and shipping was quick. For size reference I wear a 9.5 to 10 in women's shoe. Would definitely recommend.

  My husband suffers from many different foot issues (has broken ankles multiple times, has hammer toes and so problems with balls of feet/weight distribution, bad arches, etc.) and has trouble walking for any good bit of time (e.g., going to the mall, going on a hike, sightseeing on vacation, etc.). I bought him these compression sleeves with the ankle support hoping they‚Äôd help on a South African Safari trip and he LOVES them! He‚Äôs tried lots of other similar products and has found them to be too bulky or too constricting. But he says THESE sleeves are PERFECT ‚Äî just the right amount of compression and soft! And he says the ankle wrap provided gives the perfect amount of support, too. He is 6‚Äô2, 220lbs., with size 10.5/11 feet and fairly small/thin ankles.

  So far so good! I just got them and today is my first day of wearing them. It does seem like it holds my foot in place a little better thus helping to relieve some of the pressure when I step. I thought when I purchased that this came in a pair? but it is just a single sock with wrap. I'm glad ordered two so I do have one for each foot.  I put my socks over and we will see how it goes !  Oh ya I forgot to mention that I have wide feet so it's nice but these don't go all the way up do the ball of your foot, I tried different brand but that brand was too tight. These seem to be better.

  First off, I did not receive this free or discounted , I  paid 14 bucks.  I hate reading a review that gets me all excited then seeing that.  So the sock is pretty good, helps with plantar fasciitis for me, not awesome but pretty good.  Amazingly, there was a free bonus strap that I had no clue what to do with til the seller sent an email with instructions.  It goes under the arch, crosses in front and it back around the ankle, then velcros itself.  Too big for under shoes I think.  Anyway, tried it today and it was freakin' amazing.  It won't heal plantar fasciitis, but it made the pain stop so I could walk for awhile.  If you get this it won't have bonus strap instructions, and I no longer have the email or I'd post them.  So ask the seller right away for how the strap works if you have plantar fasciitis pain.  Again, not a miracle cure, but somehow holds the arch and ankle so the pain subsides tremendously.

  Looked at several compression type garments for ankle sprain but reviews were all over the place as far as sizing/fit, and if I managed to measure properly and get one that fits now with swelling would it be too large to be effective in a few days when the swelling started to subside (requiring a second purchase)? Came across this one which also included a separate compression wrap which allows for an adjustable fit. It's perfect! The sleeve itself is thick, very soft and comfortable to wear, and the separate wrap has allowed me to adjust not only for fit but  also the location of where I want the most pressure applied. Fyi, given it's thick it might be tough to wear with a loafer type shoe but would likely be fine w/lace ups or slides.

  I have been having some pain on my left ankle due to my recent bad ‚Äúbone-cracking‚Äù habits. This ankle brace is a great pain relief for that ankle of mine in addition to the pain relief lotion I have been taking. It is pretty comfortable for me to wear it. It also gives me a smooth and soft touch feel to my painful ankle as described. Additionally, I can use the adjustable strap to increase the level of support my painful ankle as needed or necessary. The Instruction Manual shows how easily to use the adjustable strap. I can still move freely when doing routine exercises at home by wearing this ankle brace on without any problem. For these reasons, I may buy it again to keep as a spare or to give as a gift to my relative.

  I received the product quickly, but I would like to give a word of advice to those of you ladies who are hourglass shaped like me.  I bought the small based on the size chart because I have a 26.5 - 28 in waist (depending on TOM), but my hips are 36.5 - 37 inches.  I'm 5 feet tall, but even at my natural waistline, the brace is not long enough to hug the area I need it to.  My back pain is very low (L5 and coccyx), so to get relief, I need to wear it around my hips.  It was tight wearing it that low, but I got no relief wearing it at my natural waistline.  The company is great and is allowing me to return for the correct size.  I will update my review when I receive it.  If you are shaped like me, size up so that it can comfortably fit around your hips.

  I have 4 herniated lower back discs. I couldn't cook dinner without crying. I tried this back brace the first day, and it hurt like Hell. However, today I removed the removable lumbar triangle and gave it another shot. I am happy to report that not only was I able to cook dinner for my family with no pain, I emptied the dishwasher AND took out the trash! Now I'm playing cards like a normal human being. I got this brace because I have a trip planned to Ireland (the land of my people) in June. I didn't think I would be able to go. Now, I believe there is hope. Thank you soooo much!UPDATE: This back brace saved my butt on holiday. Made it through 10 days of airports, trains and non-stop walking all over Ireland and Scotland. The trick is not to make it too tight (or too loose). Again, I also removed the removable lumbar support. I didn't even get double screened at the airport with it on. Fantastic!

  This brace is great.  Sizing is tough to understand, had to exchange for size smaller.  I‚Äôm a size 35‚Äù waist most of the time, occasionally get down to a 34‚Äù when really active.  I purshased the large, had to send back for medium.  I‚Äôd say you need to be at the very least 47-50‚Äù waist for the large.  These products are meant to stretch to size.  My 35‚Äù waist provided an easy 6‚Äù gap of loose material when wearing the brace.  Really the only con with the brace is that the Velcro sections are only a couple few inches wide, meaning you have to purchase the perfect size or it won‚Äôt work.  I especially like the lumbar pad, good for my exact injury.

  I have L5-S1 Spondylolisthesis + 3 lumbar level disc herniations. I am in pain if I stand for more than 2 hrs.; I've found using a Lumbar Support Belt doubles for activity tolerance. I've had 3 of those copper-infused belts, with daily use the elasticity loses it shape after 6 mo. I used more substantial belts, but they pop-off due to my (now 47"" waistline).  also used belts with hard plastic stays that are encased in pouches. These are uncomfortable. This Sparthos back brace is the best compromise. It is substantially more supportive than the flimsy belts; it is more comfortable than the plastic stay belts. The sizes are very generous. I have a Medium belt. Size Large is for waist of 50"" or more. It has a secondary ""overlying strap"" ( see advert.) which can be cinched down for more support when standing/walking, but may be relaxed when sitting. I am a retired physician. I suggest you try this belt before wasting your money on the alternatives described in this review.

  This back brace was approved by my chiropractor. It does help, but honestly I didn't find it as comfortable as a brace I previously wore. I thought it would be more comfortable based on other reviews. The issue for me was that only part of it stretches so it was difficult to get it at the right tightness without being too tight. A brace I used previously had just a bit of stretch all the way around so while it supported you, it also moved with you just a bit. It didn't feel so much like a guillotine around your middle. Still, this brace can help considerably with back pain. If you find it uncomfortable for long periods of time but really need a quality back brace, simply take small breaks from wearing it.Make sure to measure your waist where you will be wearing the brace and order your size accordingly. That is the only way to ensure you choose the correct size.

  My husband has had major back problems for years.  His life consists of slipped discs, sciatica, cortisone shots, surgeries, pills, arthritis, and of course pain.  It's a given that his line of work (remodeling) has taken a major toll on his body.  He has always wore back braces and there were many, many days of him coming home hunched over in pain.  He has worn this brace for 3 days now and you would not believe the difference, even on the day working close to 10 hours!  He is no longer hunched over; he is feeling pretty good.  He even said it has affected his mood, as he's not hurting while he's working anymore.  Obviously it hasn't ""cured"" his problems - he still has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning - but this brace has been nothing sort of amazing for him.  Thank you Sparthos!!!

  I ordered this mainly for the air pressure gauge. I am a soccer coach and wanted to make sure my soccer balls were inflated properly. Other gauges I had purchased previously were inaccurate and/or did not work at all. This gauge works very well and it is easy to use. I would highly recommend this kit just for the gauge.As far as the pump goes, it also works great. I had another pump already, but I have actually replaced it with this one. What I like about it is that the hose and need are very easy to remove from the pump and reattach. I don't like leaving the needle attached because I get holes poked in my bag. With this pump, I either unscrew the hose with needle attached and carry it separately, or I sometimes leave a rubber band wrapped around the pump, and when I am done using it, I fold the hose up against the pump and secure it with the rubber band. This keeps the needle close to the pump and doesn't allow it to poke holes in my bag or anything in my bag.I highly recommend this kit, as it is easy to use, works flawlessly up to this point, and is inexpensive.

  Wow. Not sure why this has such high reviews. It is very, very cheap. Not worth the money. The pump part is completely unstable, if you stop pumping for a second air starts to escape from the ball. I bough this because of the tube option at the end. However I‚Äôm quickly regretting it. My last ball pump was a wilson and that one worked great.

  I ended up getting this because I ordered a new Basketball since my old one was losing its grip. When it arrived it wasnt pumped up enough and I couldnt find my old basketball pump so I ordered this Franklin one.I will keep this review short since I dont think anyone wants to read an encyclopedia. The Pump works great, you dont need to use the hose that it comes with, even though you can. It comes with 3 needls, a pressure gauge as well as a little carrying case that I wasnt expecting.Other than that, there isnt anything you need to know, other than its worth the money to get a pump that may cost a bit extra and wont have needles snapping on you all of the time.

  Ordered and received this today to have another pump on hand for sports ball inflation.  This is totally cheap and not even worth the low price.  The body of the pump feels like I'm likely to dent or crush it while holding it.  I used it to inflate a mini sized basketball, it took more effort that I thought, not sure how this will stand up to regulation sized balls.I guess it's useful to hang onto for smaller balls or minor jobs but I'm back to looking for a decent option that I know will last.

  This works very well for my needs.  We have several basketballs at home and our house is where all of the other kids seems to gravitate to for playing basketball as well.  I wanted a simple pump to inflate balls when needed.  I also wanted my son to be able to use it without my help.This pump works great and it's easy to use.  We've used this to inflate my son's basketball and his friends basketballs.  I like that this set includes 3 needles, an air pressure guage and a pouch to store everything.  I keep this set in the pouch in the garage so that it can be used whenever we need to do so.  This set is a winner for me, very handy!

  This is a quality bat and ball set.  It is plastic but the thicker type that has a bit of weight to it. Our kindergarten grandson told us this summer that he needed more bats so had a choice like the real baseball players and he needed them to be different sizes and shapes.  So being good grandparents, we ordered some bats and balsl. This set was immediately  his favorite.  He says that he is a better ball player with it and can hit the ball farther.  We are practicing both with a T and pitching.  Even the older kids usually choose this bat over others. Now he says we should have just purchased a few of this kind since they are the best. We can easily recommend this set.

  Glad to have found these Blitzballs. My Shepard puppy Max loves the sound of the ball when it comes off that bat (that popping or wack sound). He hard charges out in the field and brings it back for a session of keepaway.  But what surprised me more was the fact that he doesn't  try to destroy it.

  The bat came a bit smashed on the bottom handle, so probably not very sturdy. It is plastic after all. The ball is interesting because it's not perfectly round and this probably allows for kids to hit it pretty far. I have a four year old daughter and she hits the ball pretty far for her age for her first time ever. Her first hit was probably 15 feet in the air. She also smacked the ball on three occasions about 20 feet. I'm not so sure the bat will hold up after time, but in the mean time I'm sure this ball and bat will do just fine for my 4-year-old.

  These are by far the best glasses I've gotten for my money thus far... and I buy a lot because I lose or crush them all the time.What do I like?- The arm springs are firm and appropriately springy.- The form is symmetric so the lenses don't angle strangely on my face.- The tint is dark (almost too dark, but not unreasonable), but these are definitely polarized as advertised.- These fold up compactly so they fit in my car's overhead glasses enclosure.- The nose piece is comfortable, durable, and well placed such that the glasses sit just far enough away to avoid my long eyelashes.- The metal frame appears sturdy. I've had these for a few months now and they show no sign of letting go of the lens.- The weight is good. They don't feel so lightweight as to make you think they are cheap, but they are light enough not to give you a headache after a 500 mile trip.What could be better?- The nose piece is very hard to manipulate (which is part of what makes it so durable).- As I said, the tint is almost too dark.Has Sasquatch helped you make a decision?

  If you are like me, you probably never want to spend more than $10-$20 on a pair of sunglasses.The reason for this is because you are sure you will either lose or ruin your sunglasses and few people will wish to expend any amount of effort, energy or time in their lives worrying about losing or breaking sunglasses. Life's just too short to spend any of it fretting about overly expensive sunglasses‚Äîamazing though they may be.Few things in life are more annoying than spending $250 and upwards on a pair of sunglasses only to end up sitting on them, stepping on them, or flat out losing them altogether.But good, quality sunglasses are a significant part of eye health and sharp vision. Proper lenses can go a long way in protecting one's eyes from the harmful effects of the sun's most damaging rays. And that can help in the prevention of cataracts.Enter Sungait. Sungait's glasses offer the feel, quality, style, and comfort of $100-plus eyewear at sub $50 prices. Many of their glasses go for under $20, and they are well worth it.I've had my Sungait glasses for 7 weeks now and have worn them on a daily basis by the pool, at the beach, on the road, and even playing music at gigs. Even though I wore them for several hours they remained thoroughly comfortable due to their lightweight construction. They fell out of my pocket, out of a case, and off a table a few times but suffered no damage or scratches. They are surprisingly tough for such lightweight inexpensive sunglasses ‚Äì much more durable than other pairs I have had in the same price range.They also look stylish enough that people have asked me what brand they were and where I got them. I live in the tropics where the UV index is frequently above 10, the polarized lenses of my Sungaits block the glare perfectly. They even block the surface glare on the ocean well enough for me to see underwater features.I love my Sungaits for all of these reasons. But the one reason that these are the glasses I will be buying from now on whenever I need sunglasses is simply because they are a superior quality product for a very affordable price.

  I was nervous about buying sunglasses online.  I mean, the fit, the look on your face...that VIBE you get when you put on the right pair.  How could buying without trying ever work out?  Well, these polarized, steel framed gems fit the bill, and my face.  The quality is outstanding and much more than I expected for the price.  Even the packaging was top-notch.I know, I know. Your experience might not be as amazing as mine was. Here's the good news. This company stands behind their product like no other I've heard of.EDIT: I accidentally stepped on my pair and immediately reordered!
"
1,SPORTS,SUNGAIT Ultra Lightweight Rectangular Polarized Sunglasses UV400 Protection,$13.59,5,"
  Where do I begin...I am extremely pleased with the quality and price of the sunglasses I purchased with Sungait.  My sunglasses arrived on time and when I opened the small box they came in I could not believe how well made the glasses are. The arms  are made of this really nice metal, that feels well made. Also, the nose  cushions are very unique, they are made of some type of rubber and feel very sturdy yet pliable.I was a little concerned about the fit because the bridge is smaller 14 or 16mm instead of 20mm. However, I went based off of the length  of the lens which is 62mm, and they fit great! If you are like me, anytime you go to a place like the Sunglass Hut or other places like that, the sunglasses are just not made to fit your face,  so they look way too small. I was happy that I was able to find my size based on my prescription glasses, and used that information to get a good idea of the size I needed.As if the quality of glasses was not enough, they also came in this handy-soft Pouch, a nice small screwdriver and microfiber cloth. There were two business cards included which one of them mentioned that if you like and follow the company on Facebook they will give you a free product.  I did exactly as the card stated and emailed the company. They responded quickly, within a few hours and requested my contact information  in order to send me my free product.  I imagined the free product would be something small; well, it ended up being another pair of sunglasses! They emailed me 4 different options and let me choose my free pair! They informed me that my free pair of sunglasses would not get to me for another 1 to 2 weeks, but that is a small price to pay for a free pair of quality sunglasses! I can't say enough about this company! I expect that if you purchase from them you will have the same experience I did and if for some reason you don't, I am very positive they will do everything they can to make it right. Best wishes!

  Several notions are being incorrectly perpetuated by many reviewers here with poor grasp of science. First of all, let me say that I own both this Takeya 40 oz thermos flask as well as a 40 oz Hydro Flask. These are comparable products with comparable build quality and performance in keeping fluids cool and delicious. In fact, I like the build quality on the small mouth cap of this more than the cap that comes standard with hydroflask. That alone is worth another $7 to $10. If you have a smaller mouth, you are going to appreciate drinking from this cap much more, trust me.Now, to debunk junk tests that people have been posting in their reviews. If you place 5 cubes of ice in a 40 oz container, then seal it and check on the ice 12 hours later, OF COURSE it is melted. Why? Because you sealed almost 40 oz of room temperature air into the container that the ice has now equilibrated with. If you FILL the container with ice or ice water and then check it 12 hours later, it will be closer to the same temp and structure inside the flask than if you had only partially filled it. The performance level is almost identical to the hydro flask brand but a little weaker since hydroflask has 30% more steel and is 5oz heavier (17oz to 12oz) as a result. As someone who finishes my drink within the workday period and not in 24 hours, I find that the performance is comparable to the Hydro Flask in this regard and that the less weight is actually a benefit.Second thing that is driving me nuts. Placing your flask in the fridge and finding that ice you left inside of it melted the next day does not show a technological failure but actually a SUCCESS. Once again, if you sealed room temperature air and some ice into the container, then place it in the fridge, the inside environment was so well sealed from the outside coolness of the fridge that the ice equilibrated to melt. Thermoses are not meant to ""enhance"" the cooling effect of a fridge. A thermos will only to slow down rate of reaching temperature equilibrium with the outside environment.In summary, if you want to get maximum performance of cooling retention from a thermo flask or hydro flask, try to FILL the container with cold or iced fluid at the beginning of your day. Technology only makes our lives easier when we actually understand how to utilize it.The Takeya Thermo Flask with small mouth spout that opens and closes with a single turn of the top is one of the best values I have found for this type of product.

  We ordered this as a second Takeya bottle we have a 40.oz First off the logo design on this 18oz is different from the bottle pictured and different from the bottles on the Takeya website. Second, it had no insulation, the bottle became ice cold to the touch and it did not stay cold, we did not put hot water in but my guess the bottle would have been too hot to hold.  Just to check we ordered one form the Takeya website and lo and behold it insulates, the bottle is not cold to the touch, which it should not be with double wall insulation. Also it has the correct logo on the side. We could have gotten a lemon, but the different logo kind of tipped me off. Buyer beware with this bottle.

  I am compelled to write this review as I'm sitting on the beach, in summer, trying to melt the rest of the ice in my takeya bottle. We are on hour 3 and it's hot. The fact that there is STILL ice in this thing is amazing. This bottle is awesome. Buy it.

  PLEASE BE AWARE! Do get robbed! IMITATION!This is NOT a good quality! I don't understand because it looks and feels like it. However, does NOT keep liquids cold for long at all. I kinda felt like ice was melting fast, then thought I must be imagining it. I then tested it with a cup style same size stainless steel mug with a somewhat open plastic lid with straw that I bought at a discount store for $9.99. In the morning...NO Ice as suspected with this Takeya Vaccum sealed bottle yet my $9 mug still had plenty of ice & very cold. What a DISAPPOINTMENT as this bottle was $30 BUCks!

  When I received the bottle, THERE WAS TEA IN THE BOTTLE!!! There was about a half an inch of some brown liquid that smelled of tea and what appeared to be surface rust in and around the lip of the bottle. This would be terrible quality control on Amazon's behalf, but being the bottle LEAKS LIKE A SIV, that's terrible quality on Takeya's behalf. Ended up getting the THERMOFLASK with a lifetime warranty, but I doubt I'll half to use it. Don't risk saving a little money on a cheaper bottle.

  They are exactly what I was looking for in Compression socks! Not so tight that I struggle in pain to get them on in the morning because of the arthritis in my hands but firm enough to give me support all day without making my legs feel like they are being squeezed to the point of being uncomfortable. I should add that I normally wear a medium but ordered these in a large for my comfort. This was my personal choice for what worked best for me. Getting 3 pair for what I have paid for 1 pair is a great value and 1 that I will take advantage of again.

  I am a woman in my 60s who has problems with swelling in ankles & feet.  My doctors recommended compression socks, which I was not happy about until I discovered these.  The 15-20 mmhg works for me.  I don't have to worry about shoes that fit in the morning and then are painfully tight later in the day.  I also tried 20-30 mmhg compression socks, but they were difficult to get on and I didn't see much more of a difference.  I have ordered 2 additional sets of these because I love them!  Highly recommend.

  I started noticing swollen and aching ankles around 30 weeks. I tried support hose and couldn‚Äôt handle the effort required to shimmy into full tights. The great reviews pulled me towards compression socks. Previously I associated compression socks with old diabetic men in strapless sandals. Well with my pride sailing out the door I thought I‚Äôd give them a try. I‚Äôm so happy that I did. I‚Äôve worn them all day at work, just when I get home, and overnight. Whe wearing them all day I find that I can stay on my feet at least 1-2 hours longer. If these socks don‚Äôt jive with your work apparel, I found a lot of relief by putting them on when I get home and wearing them until bed (better than the 20 minutes I was ‚Äúputting my feet up‚Äù for relief). Lastly, I tried wearing them overnight to see if they‚Äôd help with my hip and knee pain. No results there unfortunately. Overall, I find that my ankles have been staying pre-Preggo slender and I do not have ankle aches first thing in the morning. For the price it‚Äôs worth a shot. I wear women‚Äôs 10-11 (41-42) and have wider than average calves. I bought the L/XL and am happy with the fit. I wish I ordered a 6 pack from the get go. I‚Äôll be ordering the multicolored 6 pack ASAP.

  Not a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù corn bag. Very slick material which causes the bag to slide all over the board. Filler is strange as in it tends to also cause the bag to do strange things in the air. I first thought maybe my husband was complaining because he was sucking at the game with these bags.... or he had too many beers while playing.... bless his heart.... but no. I threw the bags. Our friend threw the bags. Then we threw standard bags and huge difference. Standard bags stick to the landing. These babies turned cornhole into a redneck curling event.

  The construction is not effective. The sand is inside of a plastic bag which is inside of a light weight fabric bag which is inside the outer canvas bag. Originally the weight of the bags ranged from 15 ounces to 15.8 ounces (I did weigh each of on a digital scale them when they arrived), I was willing to overlook the inconsistent weight.  In two weeks of playing with these bags the sand containment has completely failed (the inner bags all ruptured); each bag has lost about an ounce of sand so most bags are well under regulation. The canvas bags are decent quality, that is the bright point in the construction and the carrying bag is effective. Two weeks of use is not acceptable.

  Ordered these in June and they arrived Early July, BUT the shipment was one bag short. I have 4 blue and 3 red.  I wish the ""STARS"" would allow for a method to show the individual rating I assign.  I would say the durability (without actually tossing them) is Predicted to be good due to how they feel in the hand.  The sturdiness looks to be above average, the seams are all well sown and no loose ends.  The value is very good, BUT so far the customer service is non existent. I sent the vendor a private note asking to have one bag sent to me but, alas, no reply, yet.  I'll update the rating IF I get a reasonable result from my request to the vendor and I don't have to send the whole lot back just to get a full set of 8 bags with a new purchase.Update 20200709:I've upgraded my original rating after I was contacted by the vendor about the issue and a new bag will be mailed out.  Perhaps I should be been a little more patient for a response.

  The first use was fine.  The second time, started noticing they were putting off a little dust every time they landed.  Each time we've used them since, it gets worse.  Yesterday they were letting off great clouds of dust on every single impact, whether on the ground or hitting the board.  After a half dozen games there was a solid coating of dust on the board and the ground around the perimeter of both boards was white. Our pants were also dusty. Last evening in trying to ascertain the cause, I looked at the tag.  It said river sand.  So apparently, we are seeing silica dust being created with each impact.  It is not going to get better until there is no sand left the bags to grind up.  If these bags were used on break at a construction site, OSHA would ban them and fine the users.  Would not recommend this product unless you like the idea of possibly contracting silicosis from afternoons of ""harmless"" fun.  We are not going to play with them again but just throw them away for safety's sake. Would be interesting to have weighed them on arrival and after multiple uses to see how much weight was lost to dust escaping.  We paid little enough for them that I'm not going to bother trying to get a refund. Should have read the other 1 star reviews before purchase. Lesson learned.

  I rarely take the time to write reviews any more, but I wanted to make a point to bring this company's generosity to light. I purchased some of their cornhole beanbags before a late summer trip & was very pleased with not only the looks, but the quality & durability of the bags. We loved them. However, my daughter's dog is a devourer of all things that can fit into her mouth & unfortunately one of the bean bags became her casualty. I messaged the company with hopes that they would sell me a single bag to replace the fallen bag, without having to repurchase the entire set. They responded very quickly with a kind email stating that they were shipping me a new set at no cost. With so much negativity in the world lately, i was very taken back with this act of kindness. I have recieved the new set & they have created a forever customer in me. I can not reccomend them enough.

  They leak dust!  We LOVE the look and function of these bags, they're great.  The only issue we have is that there is always a puff of dust that is emitted upon impact, and it leaves imprints on the boards which are painted red, white and blue.  It's not a huge problem and we won't switch them out- at least not for a long time- but I just want others to be aware of what we have seen. Other than that, we get many compliments on the set. I would still not hesitate to buy again just for the overall quality and look, because I assume most products will do the same.

  I've tried several different kinesiology tapes, here are the results of my head-to-head comparisons...In order of stretchiness:KT Tape Pro: Super stretchy spandex-type material. Dries super fast. Breathes excellently even in multiple layers.KT Tape: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape H2O: High-elastic content cotton. Dries reasonably fast. Adequate breathability in multiple layers.Rocktape: Moderate-elastic content cotton. Takes the longest to dry but that's still fast. Not very breathable, can feel slightly stifling in multiple layers.In order of stickiness:Rocktape H2O: Can be repositioned, and will stick just as well after repositioning. Sticks to tape well. Can be uncomfortable to remove.Rocktape: Can be repositioned, but loses some stickiness each time. Edges tend to peel up. Doesn't stick to tape very well. Okay removal.KT Tape Pro: Can be repositioned, but won't stick for more than a day if you do.Sticks to tape well. Easily removed.KT Tape: Cannot be repositioned, edges tend to peel. Sticks to tape adequately well. Seems more painful to remove than others.In order of longevity:Rocktape H2O: 3+ days. Stays put until you take it off.KT Tape Pro: 2-4 days. Once you get it stuck on, it stays. Less peeling than Rocktape.Rocktape: 2-4 days. Edges tend to peel up on day 2, so you've got to trim it down.KT Tape: 1 day. Edges and entire parts of strips peel up almost immediately.In order of support:Rocktape: Very stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a lightly structured brace. Useful for areas where you need a lot of stability like knees and ankles.Rocktape H2O: Stable support.Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression brace. Useful for areas where you need both stretch and support, better adhesion and superior stretch offers excellent 'massage' for sore muscles.KT Tape: Moderately stable support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a compression sleeve.KT Tape Pro: Light to moderate support. Multiple layers offer similar support to a soft compression sleeve. Useful for areas where you need flexibility first, particularly well-suited to wrists and fingers.

  I use this stuff for my plantar fasciitis and it actually works! It takes a time or two to learn how to best apply it. For me I find that if I apply it after a shower and really washed the area of application that I can get 5-7 days per application. Make sure not to apply lotions or oils around the strips or else they will come off quicker.Update: after a month of using this product, I discovered the importance of effective exfoliation prior to application. If I exfoliate and wash the area with soap prior to applying mine will last up to 9 days before beginning to peel. Also any non-hairy areas last longer than hairy areas.

  I'm left handed and I've torn my left rotator twice, along with my bicep. To get added support, I bought the KT tape.  My thoughts were that with Kerri Walsh being a sponsor, it must be good stuff and I'm not overjoyed with it.I had a hard time with this and wasted 5 of the 20 strips trying to get it to stick.  To place it for rotator support, it's very difficult to place yourself and the tape has a tendency to ""slingshot"" back when trying to apply it.  It sticks to itself great but it didn't stick well to my skin.  Because I paid $15 for the roll, I'll use what I have left, as best I can but I won't rebuy this brand.** UPDATE 10-08-2017 **KT immediately contacted me after my review was published and as you can see from their response, offered tips and tricks.  Additionally, they offered to replace the roll at no charge.  I gladly took them up on this offer and they shipped the replacement roll, free of charge, immediately.The tips and tricks did help but I still have trouble getting this on myself (because of my injury location), but it's no fault of KT.  My suggestion to you is that if you have a rotator cuff injury that you're trying to support, have someone else put the tape on for you.  The instructions inside the package will also give you a picture of how to apply it correctly for that particular injury location.** Update 2 ***It will help you out tremendously if you buy some alcohol prep pads, which are very inexpensive.  I've found that by wiping down the area with a prep pad and letting it dry, before I apply the KT tape, makes a huge difference.  The tape seems to go on better and adhere to the skin better, in addition to easier removal when you're read to take it off.** Update 3 **I've updated my review to a 5 star rating.  I don't know if KT has improved the adhesive on their product or if the big difference was made by me learning to apply it correctly.  Whatever the situation, this stuff REALLY sticks.Before I apply it, I just pour some alcohol on a paper towel and wipe down the area thoroughly, before letting it dry or wiping it down with another paper towel.  There's no danger of this stuff coming off and I'd suggest when you remove it, that you do so in the shower.  If you pull it too quickly - like a band-aid, you're gonna pull skin.In my opinion, the precut strips are the way to go and here's a tip: When you start to put them on, peel the backing back only about one inch.  This will allow you to get it started without it flopping back and sticking it on itself or on your hands and from there, just slowly remove the backing as you move along the area that you're applying it too. Once I've started it, I just hold the backing tape with my thumb and index finger and I'm moving it along my arm and shoulder.  When you get the technique down, it's easy to apply yourself (unless you're putting it on your back).KT Tape has been a tremendous help to me.  I've reordered three times and will continue to do so in the future.

  I purchased this Inspire 2 as in upgrade to my old Alta HR. I liked the Alta HR because it had a slim profile and was simple to use. The Inspire 2 has two flaws that are deal breakers for me. 1: you cannot change the ‚Äúapps‚Äù that display on the face - so if someone was looking at my Fitbit they could see my weight. I am a teacher, my students play with my Fitbit at times and I don‚Äôt need them to know that personal information. 2: Whenever my wrist and arm touch together, it makes my Fitbit vibrate. I have worn it for not even an hour and had to take it off because it was annoying.I spend nearly 1/2 an hour on the phone with Fitbit customer service for them to go through their whole speech, to find out these a ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that can‚Äôt be removed.

  My four year old Charge 2 HR battery was getting weak so I decide to buy a new Inspire 2 and I‚Äôm glad I did.First of all, it does everything and more than what my Charge 2 HR did for me, which was quite a lot.  Without taking advantage of the free Premium offer, all the data presentation I enjoyed with the older Charge 2 HR is included in Inspire 2.  Plus improvements in looks, screen brightness, a much longer battery life and a link to my phone GPS for improved tracking of my long walks.The negative reviews I‚Äôve read revolve mostly around the irritation of the vibration notifications.  To preempt those problems I immediately turned off almost all of the notifications.  Do you really need your watch tell you your phone is ringing?  Or you can‚Äôt remember that you‚Äôve been sitting in your chair for the last hour?The setup was super easy.  From your current app account, add a device and make sure it synchs to your new Inspire 2 so all of the data stored in your old Fitbit ports into you new device.  I just let the battery run out on my old Fitbit and will soon delete it from my account.For only $99 this is a great device.

  I'm really sad that this Inspire 2 is catching so much grief in the reviews here, but what I believe it boils down to is most people only leave bad reviews. If someone is happy with something they usually won't take the time to come on an write about it unless it is beyond brilliant. I wont go so far as to say this fitbit is that, but it is a wonderful gadget and personally I find no truths in what many here are complaining about. Firstly I would like to start with, if comparing to the HR and making a decision between the two, definitely go with the newer model. It does more; like the 24/7 heart rate monitor which is really great to keep an eye on, the active zones and a great battery life. So far I've gone 4 days with no charge and only gotten to 65%, that's incredible to me. Not to mention this new model includes a free year of premium which has a lot of great stuff in it like fitness guides and mediation exercises.When I was making the decision I read pros and cons comparisons and ultimately it was these and the sluggish touch screen on the HR that led me to choose the Inspire 2. I'm glad I did, I have zero regrets. And for some reason this is cheaper right now than the older model! (Edit: it looks like that was  pre holiday sale and it's more expensive now which does make sense, it is better) It's functioning flawlessly. It was a great price, is very easy to use, and really is a good little motivator.I love the gentle alarms, the relax exercises, and the little reminders to drink water and exercise. The sleep tracking is really fascinating and a personal goal of mine to work on, this is a major help to me in that regard. I love that it is swim safe as well, since I'm big on swimming.I have pretty small wrists, and while it sits off of it a bit, it's not overly bulky and is light, and by no means bothersome.Also the recommendation for wearing it is slightly loose, not snug, and I find the best position for it is just above the ulna.As far as people having trouble with it getting stuck on one screen and always showing their weight or constantly buzzing with alerts? That is 100% user error. I will say with confidence if you take your time to sit down and just read through and explore the app with patience, it is all very user friendly. These screens can be backed out of, changed, and alarms/ reminders set or cancelled.There was also a review that mentioned there's no way to view the HR on the main screen, and you have to swipe through 5 times or so to get to it. While that is one way, there is also the quick function on the home screen just below the clock, tapping this will cycle through which to display (HR, calories, active zones, miles, and steps) so you can have your HR and time visible anytime.My two biggest ""issues"" with it which are very minor, would be the band, which tends to irritate the skin slightly with constant wear. Cleaning, switching wrists or bands is a simple solution.The other one is that the steps aren't incredibly accurate, they give a rough idea, but I tend to halve mine based off of my walking routes that I know. This is a broad guess on my part, steps matter least to me but it's probably closer to 75% accurate.Keeping that and the relatively low price in mind, I think this is a wonderful all over health tracker and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality tracker at a reasonable price and healthier lifestyle. It is a small piece of plastic that I find quite incredible at what it is capable of doing for being so tiny, and am amazed at all of the extras in this!

  I have the Alta HR and the face is pretty scratched.  I have short arms so all the Fitbits are too large.  I was so excited when this came in yesterday and it is about the same size as my Alta.  But then every time I bent my wrist and it had skin to skin contact it immediately vibrated.  There are no buttons just to turn it on, you just finger touch both sides.  Obviously you flex your wrist all day.  All of those vibrations every 2 minutes or sooner is a hard fail and there isn't a touch sensitivity that you can play with.  My other problem is that it didn't give me the reminders to move, even though I had it turned on.  So it's being returned and back to my scratched Alta :-(

  This is a great, five star product BUT DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! I've now had three 2.5oz tubes ($45 worth of Body Glide) arrive to me a useless, gooey mess because at some point in the Amazon warehouse the tubes were allowed to sit above their recommended storage temperature and change consistency. How do I know? Because I left a good tube of Body Glide in my car on a summer day once and this is what it turns in to. It applies thick, wears off easily, and is overall miserable. Buy it from a local store (a lot of big chain stores now carry it) or directly from Body Glide on their site (never had a gooey one directly from them). Just don't buy it from Amazon.

  Omg this stuff is the best! I am a chubby girl and I recently went to Thailand where it was 90¬∞ with a 70% humidity every single day I was there. This stuff got me through! I was able to wear dresses and shorts with no chafing! And I only ever had to apply in the morning and once in the middle of the day! My life is forever changed I‚Äôve already ordered two more!

  I am a lifelong curvy lady whose thighs have rubbed together since the beginning of time, probably, so I‚Äôm no stranger to chafing. I heard about this product a long time ago, but for some reason I didn‚Äôt trust it - it wouldn‚Äôt work for me, somehow, and so I disregarded it. I wear cotton bike shorts under my dresses, and that helps a little, but there‚Äôs still bare parts of my skin that touch and I can‚Äôt wear them with denim shorts, rompers, etc.I continued to read good things, and as summer was fast approaching and we were set to have our first Very Hot weekend of the year, I ordered the smallest size and told myself I‚Äôd give it a shot. This morning I applied the balm to my inner thighs under a sundress and spent a day walking around in the heat and sunshine; it was hot, and I was sweating, but miraculously, my thighs felt fine!I applied the balm at around 11:30 am and as I write my review it‚Äôs almost 7:30 pm but my legs are going strong. Other parts of me have definitely reacted to being out and about but not my thighs - without this stuff, they would be pink and tender, but they feel soft and happy. I am absolutely impressed.Long story short, this stuff absolutely worked for me; I plan to buy a larger size when this smaller one runs out. Don‚Äôt be a doubter like I was!

  I'm fat,  I chafe, it's gross and hurts like hell.This product solves that problem.  I started walking 10 miles a day,  normally by the 5th mile I'm ready to call someone to pick me up.  Not because i'm exhausted, tired, muscles hurt.  Because my fat thighs are rubbing together trying to make fire like I'm trying out for Survivorman.  As long as I remember to put this on before my walk (applied like deodorant) I am completely chafe free.  This product is a lifesaver.

  I'm an avid Disney visitor. Considering Fl is basically Hell on Earth, shorts are ideal for walking in heat from 9am to 12am. In the past I've tried baby powder and deoderant for chafing, but they have never lasted more than a few hours. This body glide stuff actually lasted and I literally felt NO tenderness in my inner thighs by the end of the day. I'm talking being able to wear shorts 2 days in a row at the parks with no injury, which I haven't been able to do before! I recommend this to anyone.IMPORTANT TO NOTE THOUGH: I did put this on and immediately put on a chiffon dress after. Sadly, the grease(?) of the body glide got on the dress. I don't fully fault the product, I should have waited or been more aware, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. It hasn't gotten on other clothes so far, but some fabrics are most susceptible to those stains. Also, ""greasy"" may not be the best word. It's not like oil on your legs, but it's not exactly like dry powder deodorants.

  I really don‚Äôt get the hype!  I didn‚Äôt even think twice when purchasing this because of its amazing ratings. But I‚Äôm seeing these ratings are pretty old.  My best guess is they have changed the formula since these great reviews. Used on my thighs for those Florida days in dresses. It does NOT make your skin glide against itself. In fact it made it worse. This is a big nope from me.

  ¬†This stuff really is AWESOME. It really works and I don't know where it has been all my life. I started looking for something for thigh chafing after running into a few issues (not fun) and I read about a few options, of which Body Glide fell to the top of each list. I bought it and it was fantastic. No rubbing, no issue. And it is super easy to use, just slide it on like you'd use deodorant. I give it a few good swipes on any area that may even think about touching and I'm done. And it is light as a feather, leaves no residue (see my photo and video). It was so light that I actually thought that it would not work as I was expecting some slippery substance, but... not the case.And I have taken this Body Glide on the ULTIMATE test... a vacation to Mexico where chaffing thighs become both me and my husband's problem due to the constant wet skin and the constant walking. So we both used it on a hike in a Mexican jungle. I just knew this would fail me. I was sweating, my things were sweating, my husband was sweating. I was expecting to have the stuff just wear off from the sweat and all the walking... but NOPE! It stayed on. I even took a dip in a waterfall and it was still on to take me back to the beach. Neither one of us had any problems and my husband was equally impressed. He said we weren't ever going on a vacation again without it. lol!So I absolutely recommend this product. Try it, you will not be dissapointed!

  Simple and easy to use.  Comfortable.  But I agree they smell funny.  It actually smells like WD40.  And for anyone who has never heard, WD40 has been recommended by some people (even some doctors) to treat arthritic symptoms.  People swear rubbing it on knees and elbows is a miracle treatment.  I have no opinion on the subject, but can't help wondering.I washed them in a sink full of dish soap and hung to dry.  Still has a slight smell but they work and feel great!

  I have either skinny wrists or oversized hands. Either way, the difference between them is huge.This wrap would not lay right no matter how I tried to wrap it or how tight. It would warp bulging outwards or buckling inwards at certain spots. A relative with hands and wrists that were much closer to the same size did not have this problem.

  These are not what you need it you have a serious wrist issue. The are comfortable, and gives you decent wrist support without bening stiff. I mostly use them while typing.The thump part is where I have a problem. It's a set of 2, not right or left specific. Maybe because of it, the thumb hold is not supportful as possible, and gaps. Also, the holes the thumbs fit through are a little too tight to be comfortable. I hope those will resolve a  I wear them. As is, Im not sure what they are supposed to accomlish.

  Bought two of these for an extended, multi-state golf vacation.  They held up well with several flights, in and out of vehicles and some rough handling by a few aggressive caddies.  The wheels are great and very smooth, and the zippers held firm and do not stick or bind.  The material is thick and did not rip, and there's a nice thick pad at the top for additional protection of the club heads.  There is plenty of room in the bag for extra stuff too.  Even with all the protection this bag offers, my wife and I loaded our semi-soft cart bags along with a stiff arm club protector to keep the clubs from snapping if they were crushed on the ends (the one weak point in all soft-sided travel bags).  Our bags and clubs made it 14 straight days without a scratch (well, maybe a scratch from the occasional club toss).  The stitching around the handles, straps and seams is solid, and 6 months later with occasional use they still look brand new.  Well worth the money, and would recommend to anyone even if you're considering a hard case.

  I was hesitant to purchase this due to it being so inexpensive compared to others.  However, I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised this bag's durability and how well it protected my clubs.  I was a little unsure if I needed to buy one of those crutch things to put in since it has a soft top.  However, I didn't purchase one and all my clubs traveled without getting bent or mangled.  The only thing I worry about is the quality of the zippers - a little sticky already and I feel like they could get stuck or come off if you pull too hard on them.  So just a heads up - don't manhandle the zippers and this should last you for a decent amount of golf trips.No need to spend more on the ""higher quality"" bags, this one will work just fine!

  This bottle is fantastic if you plan to just have it at your desk while you work. The design looks great, and the bottle feels good in your hand. The drinking straw makes the gallon jug actually usable, and the included scrubber was a nice touch for cleaning.Now on to the negative.Not sure if I had a defective unit or what.... My jug was full and fell about 18 inches, shattering the top. This left me soaked, in a pool of water, with nothing to drink about 5 seconds after entering the gym. The jug landed on a bottom corner. See photos for shattered top and vertical crack.Plan to contact Amazon/Seller. Will update with response.

  Kind of annoying to clean by hand so sometimes I end up not using this for a few weeks until I feel like dealing with that, and I have to use a straw cleaning brush I already have to clean into the handle inside.  The dish soap does rinse out easily at least, since you can‚Äôt reach in to wipe it off.  Otherwise this is great and has helped me stay on top of my hydration.  Absolutely does not leak and having two options for the top is nice.

It‚Äôs either or.

  Love love love this lid. I bought my Hydro Flask for Austin City Limits Festival last year but started using it recently to drink more water and stop wasting so many plastic bottles. While my Hydro Flask is AMAZING to keep my drinks cold the twist off top was a pain. This straw lid makes the system complete! It's easy than ever to use and in drinking water quickly. The lid is great at being leak proof given the pin/hole design (see pic) to allow air transfer when drinking but leak proof when closed. Only slight downside is cleaning requires a small extra effort, but the makes thoughtfully included an extra straw and brush to use when needed. The lid is not insulated but I'm finding the flask itself still stays remarkably cold throughout the day...If I don't drink it by the time it warms up it's time for the water to be changed anyway ;)

  I do recommend going one size down than you would normally wear -- the description notes are accurate. Take the time to measure around your knee for the right fit. Even a size down doesn't feel too tight.  It is a lighter-weight and breathable fabric, so it is good for wearing for extended periods of time or running/working out in warm weather.  The rubber/silicone does a nice job keeping the sleeves in place.

1,SPORTS,"Nexcare Waterproof Bandages Family Pack, Assorted Sizes, Tan, 100 Count",$8.99,5,"
  When I was ready to buy a new box of bandages I didn't give it a second thought. Of course I would buy Johnson & Johnson Band-Aids just like I always have, and my parents before me, and my grandparents before them. I had tried other brands in the past in an ""emergency"" and they were next to useless so I have always stuck with the leading brand. I was ready to push the ""order"" button this time but my eye caught this product from Nexcare. Never heard of them. But I saw that they are made by 3M. Who in the world knows more about adhesives (Scotch tape, Post-it Notes, etc) than 3M? So I figured what could it hurt and changed my order to a box of 100 assorted bandages in the most common sizes.I'm impressed. Unlike everyone else who simply tried to copy Band-Aid, Nexcare pretty much reinvented the bandage. To begin with, it's not the typical shape but more of a diamond shape with rounded corners. The corners don't catch on clothing and other things like the squared-off edges of other bandages and the diamond shape is far more forgiving around areas that aren't flat like knuckles, wrists, toes, etc (doesn't it seem that bandages are never needed on flat, smooth expanses of skin?)There's another major difference as well. Most bandages leave a gap along the sides where water and other stuff can get to the wound. Nexcare surrounds the entire wound and seals in in against water and foreign objects, yet the material breathes and allows healing air to penetrate. Leave it to 3M to come up with that magic.  One independent study showed that Nexcare leaked about 25 percent of the time while Band-Aid about 40 percent of the time, compared with more than 85 percent for lower-rated products.I can't count how often I've been disappointed by so-called waterproof bandages that peel off as soon as they get wet. Not so with the Nexcare product, it really sticks like glue but yet is ouchless when peeled off, even on hairy arms and legs. Another plus is that they do NOT contain latex.Bandages are something no one wears by choice and frankly this box of 100 will probably last me for years, so 3M isn't going to get rich off me.  They are priced competitively but it doesn‚Äôt hurt that Amazon often has them on sale.Are they perfect?  I can‚Äôt find any major faults with the bandages themselves but I do have one suggestion which is rather than toss all of the three sizes into the box randomly it would be nice if they put some sort of cardboard dividers to separate the sizes to make them easier to find when you don‚Äôt have a lot of time to fuss around looking for a bandage.I know this review is pretty enthusiastic about something as basic as a bandage but I do like these and now that I've tried them I think they're a big improvement from what I've been using till now.

  Ok, so I may be a bit paranoid or perhaps that I just know my family's propensity to get cuts/scrapes/injuries, but I like to have a well stocked medkit in each of our vehicles as well as a primary medkit in the house.Just before our last summer camping trip I decided that we were running a bit low on bandaids, particularly waterproof ones. Previously we'd had a similar product and really loved them, but I couldn't find the exact ones so I did my usual search on Amazon and found these.After having used them on the camping trip I'm really kind of sad....because now I need to buy several more boxes of them to replace all the other bandaids I had previously stocked. Yes, they are that good.Let me go into the specifics of why they worked awesome for us. First, there are the little tiny bandaids (22mmx26mm) which I thought were going to be somewhat useless due to their small size, but they were actually the first to win me over. My 2yr old would get bugbites (no matter how consistently bugspray was applied), and then she would scratch the bites till they bled, and she would do the same for the scabs as soon as they would form. These little bandaids were ideal for keeping her sores clean and protecting them from her little fingernails.The medium size ones worked great at covering some small cuts and scrapes on my sons hands and elbows after he lost a duel with a pine tree (amazingly, they actually stayed on him for a couple days).The large ones are big enough for moderate cuts, but still a bit too small for a normal skinned knee or elbow. I am currently using one of them to cover up an area on my knee that has a couple stitches and needs to be kept dry. It works, but I think I'll try and pick up some bigger ones to keep on hand.My final comment is regarding the individual packaging on each bandage. This type of clear bandage is very thin and floppy and on the previous version it took some effort to get the bandaid placed without getting it stuck to itself since it is almost like trying to put on a piece of saranwrap. This version has solved that problem by having a thin piece of stiffer plastic attached to the outer surface of the bandage that helps it retain its shape as you place it over the wound. After you've got the bandage stuck down, that thin bit of plastic is pulled off and you're left with a clear, unobtrusive patch that is tough, flexible, and has made an ideal waterproof barrier around the wound.Yea....as I'm writing this, I've finished convincing myself to go ahead and just upgrade all my medkits to these bandaids.

  Apply to clean and completely dry skin, press down all around edges, don‚Äôt take the paper strips off right away ... leave for at least 30 seconds before removing.  Gives the adhesive time to adhere well to skin.Be careful when removing from package and applying not to let any wrinkles form.If applied properly, this bandage becomes like a second skin, and will not come off until you peel it off, days later even. I have one on my thumb that is still sealed after hand wahings, dishes, showers.This may seem like a lot of work just to use a bandage, but worth it.  You may need to replace a different type of bandage 10 times to this one if on hands.  I get thumb splits in the winter that are painful if exposed, get wet, get bumped.  These bandages help so much!

  I don't know where these came from, but they are so dried out they have to be way outdated.  Everytime I try to unwrap, they either curl or wnot stick. Should have sent them back. I called Nexcare, but they couldn't give me any information on manufacturing date. I'd like to know when I'm getting something from an Amazon supplier, before I order. Will buy at drugstore next time.

  Cannot get it on because when taking off the back tape it comes off partially. Then it gets stuck together and can't seal straight.It crumples up and cannot be applied.I have used these before with great success. I think these are very old...

  Worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon; product should be taken off the market.  I am not a weak person but I could not take apart the hoop sections at all, no matter how hard I pressed on the button spot.  Also, two of the segments were damaged and could not even be put together; now i cannot even return it since I cannot get it apart.  This is a  horrendously bad product.

  This was such a good purchase! I wanted a way to get exercise at home that was also something I would enjoy, and I heard that hula hooping could be a good waist trainer, so I thought a weighted one was a good idea. Assembly is very easy, the only thing is I personally have to move the foam exterior to press the buttons when I'm taking it apart, which isn't really that big of a deal. I ended up cutting my nails because when you're starting out trying to learn to hula hoop and you have to constantly grab and re-spin the hoop, it is very easy to stick long nails into the foam and damage it. With practice I was able to improve my hooping skills in one day, but I highly recommend starting out slow, because I hooped for 60 minutes one night and my hip was pretty bruised, which is completely on me. I love the option to adjust the size, because some people need more room and some don't have as much.  I can't say how effective it is exercise-wise since I really just started, but I'll make sure to update- so far I think it's worth it!

  I‚Äôve worn thru a lot of hats and glad to have finally landed on this one.  A mesh area lets air circulate to give the hat a cooler feel than others I‚Äôve owned.  A drawstring can be pulled under the chin if the wind picks up--- happens all the time where I live.  The brim is a little wider than most of the hats I‚Äôve worn, definitely a plus.  With this hat and a few dabs of sunscreen, I feel I‚Äôm pretty well protected from the damaging rays of the Sun.  Happy purchase!

  I have a size 7 head. Had to sinch the drawstring in the back as tight as it would go. I don't have eyes in the back of my head, but I'm pretty sure that looks a little weird from the back. It's still a little big but manageable. I like the look and the coverage, and the material appears to breathe well, especially with the vents going all the way around the hat. It looks pretty good. Upon receipt, I was able to sign up for a lifetime warranty on the hat. I hope that doesn't consist of me being spam mailed to death. I hope I don't have to return it anytime soon. It appears to be made well enough to last a while. If you treat your equipment well it will take care of you. This hat is no different.

  This hat, actually hats, were a hit! I bought one for my cardiologist who is retiring in 2 weeks plus got me one also to putter around in the back yard feeding birds, watering, etc. I had my last appointment today with my DR and presented him with this hat because I heard he loves fishing so I figured this would be perfect out fishing or on a boat, etc. He was so happy with this. He actually put it on and told me about his last fave hat he had 15 years and then one day a gust of wind blew it off because he goes out on the ocean fishing sometimes. Anyways, I told him not anymore, showed him the chin strap and how easy it is to use. Showed him the ventilation mesh on top to help cool, he really loved that, and showed him the 2 snaps on each side at the top of the hat, told him he can look Australian then mate ;-). So, this hat was just perfect and a great bargain for the price. So, Dr loves his hat, plus the fishing shirt I got him, plus retirement cup for his coffee with a witty saying, plus his lures and sinkers and antler desk top clock I got him. lol. Great present. Love my hat. Thanks. Great deal. I will be buying more, my ex saw mine and liked it :-)

  As a person who has had multiple procedures done as a result of basal cell carcinoma,(skin cancer) I am very careful to wear protective clothing whenever I am going to be exposed to the sun.  I had lost the hat that I used for several years and I had to replace it, so after reading the reviews from people who had purchased this hat, I decided to give it a try.  The hat is prefect!!  It is very light weight and extremely comfortable in addition to providing the sun protection I need.  Thank you for a product that covers all the bases I need covered!!

  ""Delivery was fast. Hat was delivered flattened but not folded. I expected it to be a crunched up bundle. Pleasantly pleased. Size adjustment was at its max when delivered. Fits just right. Haven't tested for its water shedding but love the look, wide brim and I can still carry my bug net and neck gaiter when I snap up the sides of the brim. Great price.""update:Purchased 2nd hat for family member and found that the size adjustment to make it smaller doesn't stay tight. Difficult to grasp in your fingers to adjust . When you set the size the  clasp will not hold the line securely....line too narrow??  Does not function. A barrel lock w/good spring is needed..thicker line....or even the two holed leather pulls that are on some chin straps would be better. Really not adjustable as is...too bad.

  Bought these as a replacement to my girlfriends rubber resistance bands that we thought she lost (was found later). My girlfriend had already gone to the highest level of resistance with the rubber ones and was now doubling up on them to get the resistance she needed. But I noticed how often it‚Äôs roll around and ride up her leg and how she‚Äôd paid to fix it constantly . THESE ARE PERFECT. She used the ‚Äúlight‚Äù weight option and said it was as tough as the toughest one of the rubbers! Plus with all the booty workouts she does she moves ALOT and I have not once seen these ride up her leg or roll up on her at allEven though she did find the old bands since having these she has not touched them once and only sticks to these new ones instead.Kudos on a well made product all the way around!(They even look amazing!)

  When the gyms closed due to Covid-19, I had to up my home gym. Bands are an easy and inexpensive way to workout at home. The bands are very high quality and having three different strengths to work with is awesome.

I‚Äôve used them on my bare legs before and haven‚Äôt had this problem until now, but I‚Äôm definitely positive that it was from the band as I felt the chafing and pain in the area while using it. I‚Äôll probably just use them while wearing workout pants from here on out to avoid this.

  These are some tough workout bands. They feel much stronger than the rubber resistance bands that I‚Äôm used to. Since these are made out of cloth they feel a lot better when they are rubbing against my skin when I use them. The rubber bands that I use to use always felt a little abrasive on my skin.

My cousin doesn‚Äôt stop thanking me, she says these gloves changed her whole life. I totally believe her.The quality is top grade. I am constantly washing it and drying it, and by just looking at the gloves you would think it‚Äôs brand new. I am going to place an order right now for an additional pair so I can switch off between the two at night.I recommend these highly and I will continue to do so. I hope with this I can bring relief to soo many people that are desperately looking for it.Don‚Äôt hesitate! Buy your pair right now!!!

  These arthritis gloves saved me. After looking for solutions for almost a dozen of years, I can‚Äôt believe it took me this long to get these.I have been suffering from arthritis for almost 20 years now. In the beginning it was just a little soreness in my fingers and my knees, but with time the symptoms increased and multiplied by leaps and bounds. I began experiencing intermittent pain in the joints, ankle, back, fingers, hands, muscles, neck, and wrist. The pain in the fingers and hands were the worst. They really impacted my day to day life more than anything else.I was becoming handicapped. It was horrible to become so dependent on others at such a young age.¬†In my younger years I have been a court stenographer. As soon as the arthritis symptoms appeared I was forced to give it up. I tried other small jobs over the years, but arthritis ripped me away from the occupation that suited me most.My Dr. referred me to a Rheumatologist who suggested the following:* Hydrotherapy* Stretching* Massages* AcupunctureAnd many more diverse ideas. Some were more soothing and some were less, but that‚Äôs all they were. Soothing. During the hydrotherapy I blessed the instructor.i haven‚Äôt felt so good in years! But that relief was short lived, as it only lasted for a short while, and later that day I was back to square one.My wife and 3 children were all very worried about me. They didn‚Äôt stop suggesting different remedies they have head about:* physical exercise¬†* Weight loss* Heating pad* Ice packs* Cold compressesAnd I tried. I really did. I went through each of them. When it didn‚Äôt work I gave it another chance and another chance. I was sooo desperate!¬†I am big believer of natural, and therefore I didn‚Äôt try any medications. I don‚Äôt believe any of them would have helped anyways!I was beginning to give up hope. I thought I was done for life, since any daily chore became so difficult. I didn‚Äôt like depending on others and being a burden on them.Then a miracle happened. My daughter bought me a pair of ComfyBrace arthritis gloves as a gift for Christmas. I was really skeptical. After nothing helped, why would this be different? Well, you gotta believe it. I was so desperate that I was willing to try anything, and try it I did. It only took a few hours for the gloves to begin their magic. The size large fits me comfortably. (How did my sweet daughter know exactly what size to get? God bless her!) It has the perfect balance. The compression is great, but it‚Äôs not painful. I wouldn‚Äôt say it happened over night, but in a very short time I was doing things again that were very difficult for me a mere 2 days ago.¬†I did not become young again, and I will not be a court stenographer ever again, butat least I got my independence back. I am still looking for a solution to all the other pains, perhaps someone has a solution for that??I ordered another pair, so I can wear it when the other one is in the wash. I couldn‚Äôt wait until it dries to put it back on, a second pair was crucial.So far I have been highly satisfied, and I‚Äôm extremely thankful for this amazing creation.I have been wearing it for only a couple of weeks now, I will definitely update my review in a few weeks to let you know how it has been going!I highly recommend that everyone tries this! Nothing like it....

As far as we can tell, the sizes are the same except the medium has longer fingers, we decided we will keep both for our individual needs.

  I bought this product in June 2018 for severe pain and stiffness in my hands. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. These gloves are absoulutely fantastic! I bought the size small. They fit nicely, just enough compression, but not uncomfortable at all. They are very durable, as well. I've washed them multiple times and they still hold up like day 1. No stitching has come loose, the fabric doesn't pill and they don't make your hands sweat like crazy if you want to do chores or be out side when it's warm outside.I'm extremely happy that I bought these! I really cannot stress enough how much these helped me. When the pain is severe in my hands, I litereally can't move my fingers. AT ALL. Usually after wearing the gloves for the first part of the day I can  clench my right hand, and partially the left and the pain is WAY WAY less than if I had not had them on.

  So I'm fat. Like, 270+ pounds of thighs and meat. My thighs rub together like nobody's business. Like, as soon as they start touching I'm in pain/ bumps form/ my skin starts burning off. This saved my f****ng life. I went on vacation in vt and did some hiking with a dress (because fashion/wanted to try this stuff out) and was BLOWN AWAY. There is ZERO greasiness. It goes on like lotion. Apply generously, massage into problem areas and GO. It feels like there is nothing there. I was genuinely shocked by how amazing it was. Went swimming in a lake, got out and did some more walking. Still zero pain. Zero bumps. ZERO irritation. Summer has never been so easy. I don't leave my home without it. 10/10 would recommend.

  Ok so I was a little skeptical at first. As I greased up my nuts, I felt like this has got to be a mistake, I thought for sure that I was gonna squish around like two sumos covered in crisco oil!

Lot of people think sheep just live happily on a farm and get shorn from time to time, but look up some videos online, it's horrific the torment those animals go through. I did some more research and it seems Enzo's Buttonhole is the best choice and it works very well and it's vegan and well priced and highly recommended by lots of people.

  I read the rave reviews for this product and I was trying to use it instead of RunGoo,which works extremely well but will stain white shirts.  I use anti chaff products for my mid to long runs (6 miles to 13 miles).  Opened up the tube and the first thing I noticed was how thin and runny this cream was and that should have been a warning. Both RunGoo and Glide are thick paste or waxy products that protect.  Bottom line I went on an 8 mile run in 77F temperatures on a humid morning and I was very tender afterwards. Had I run 12 miles I surely would have bled through my shirt.  Basically this stuff is only good for very light chaffing, and won't work for runners.I am really getting disillusioned by the positive reviews on Amazon on many products.

  After years of a pretty sedentary lifestyle, I started getting into biking this past April.  Since May I have purchased 2 bikes and I am riding several times per week.  The two most important things for my comfort are a good pair of cycling shorts / bibs with a high quality chamois (see my other reviews for recommendations) and chamois cream.  The Chamois Butt‚Äôr Cream is my favorite.  It is affordable, non-greasy, non staining and odorless.  But most importantly, IT WORKS!!  My longest ride to date was 100 miles but with good cycling shorts and Chamois Butt‚Äôr cream, I did not have any chaffing or skin / friction problems even on an all day ride.To paraphrase the Old AmEx commercial, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave home on your bike without it.‚Äù

  *****VERY IMPORTANT NOTE*****This is not a replacement for Vaseline or body glide!  What do I mean?I have been using chamois butt'r for about 4 years now, and it works great.  The only complaint I have had is that the pricing seems to be out of control... this stuff has become super expensive over the last several years.  But it really does help on the long rides.So I hadbeen training for Ironman Cozumel 2015 (first one) and I decided that I would throw small packets of chamois butt'r into my transition bags as a quick fix for chaffing... HUGE MISTAKE!  I did this because when you are wet, body glide doesn't really go on easily, and i had never trained with vaseline...which is what a lot of people were using.  If you could have seen my face after i applied the chamois butt'r to my already semi-chaffed areas (under my arms, and my inner thighs), you would have thought i was re-enacting the Home Alone scene where Macaulay Culkin slaps after shave on his face.  My eyes widen, my ""O"" face came out, but I was able to hold the scream in.  It took a second for the burn to kick in... and took several mins for it to go away.  I finished the race, but i will never use chamois butt'r for anything other than on my chamois....

  Oh man the praise i have for this stuff, I'll even overlook the smell just because it works so well. My butt cheeks have never been happier since i started using this magic lotion. Before this, i could start a fire with the friction going on between my thighs. If you're active and you're definitely lacking in the ""thigh-gap"" department, i highly recommend this stuff. Its amazing. I personally don't dig the smell but life without chaffing is totally worth dealing with the smell

  I started doing endurance rides and got this just to see what it was like, and bought it rather sheepishly.PROS:Delivers out of the squeezed tube in a very controllable way.Spreads on easily.Does what it says it does:  prevents chaffing on long rides (I've only done up to 4 hours so far, but no problem.)Love the coconut smell.  After a long ride, your nasty bib smells like a new beach toy, haha.CONS:Seems a bit expensiveGotta say, I'm impressed.  I don't chaffe bad at all on 2 hour rides, but I've noticed a difference with vs without.  Heck, I'd buy it JUST for the better smelling soiled bib!

  Remember growing up you had to take several of these to the face on the playground to prove you were a challenger?  I do.  These balls are perfect for mixing it up in the playground and teaching kids to be tough again.  Just remind them that there's no crying after you get hit.

  If you are interested in buying this ball for kick ball or dodge ball, buy it.  Do not pay any attention to the the one star reviews.  I bet that every ball that has failed has been over inflated.  It says right on the ball, ""Inflate to 1.5 lbs. of air pressure.  I used a digital air pump to inflate.  It doesn't take much air at 1.5 pounds.  I've played several kick ball games with family, friends and neighbors, adults and kids, the ball has held up with zero problems.  Most people who have touched the ball says it needs air but it doesn't.  It's keeps it's shape while still being soft.  It's easy to grip, it doesn't hurt when you are hit with it and the adults can't kick it a mile because it gives so much at 1.5 pounds of air pressure.  I have never left it outside in the sun and wouldn't recommend it.  I can't remember anything made of rubber lasting when left out in the elements.

  Ok - this is the only brand worth purchasing based on our experience.  The rubber is good quality.  We've had great luck with this brand.  All the other brands had low quality rubber that ruptured within weeks.  We have about 3 of them and so far none of them show signs of ware.Most people are using this ball wrong and they are WAY over inflating it.  1.5 pounds is hardly anything.  You should be able to squish it down easily.  If it says it's a P1000K then it is 100% the 10"" ball that most people are inflating all the way to 12"" inches +.  Then they wonder why they rupture.  Of course, if it lands on a sharp stick it will break i'm sure.  Hasn't happened to us, but these are not basketballs or soccer balls.  The very concept of a kickball ball makes it be somewhat vulnerable.  It's not the brand, it's the type of ball you are using.  This is a RUBBER ball.  Understand rubber.  Anything stronger and you would not have a kickball.TIPS:1) P1000K should be about 10"" when properly inflated.  If you don't have a gauge that is ultra sensitive, then get a tape measure and estimate.2) They are not meant to take direct sunlight for prolonged time.  That is, don't leave them laying exposed in the sunlight when not in use.  I doubt the rubber is UV stable.3) Deflate them in the winter when not in use.  Rubber warps when cold as it tries to shrink, but, because of pressure, can't.4) Try to avoid sharp objects in the field (this goes without saying, but, reading reviews, maybe not)We use these every week at our compound and they are great.  So much fun.  Don't forget to warm up a little :)Life is good!

  I purchased a kit through Amazon to inflate the ball that included a pressure gage, etc.  I did NOT over inflate the ball. I do long distance bicycling; I'm familiar with inflating tires, etc.5 days after inflating the ball, it exploded.  The ball had never been used, it was sitting on my sofa.  I was planning to play kick ball for the first time with my Grandson that coming weekend.My wife threw it out, or I would have returned it for a refund.

  My kids and I love playing kickball with the nieces, nephews, cousins, etc., and we play whenever we can.  These balls rock.  The adult size is markedly larger, and took some adjustments in our game since we previously apparently bought the kids size, but having the larger sized ball makes the game a little more competitive because the adults can't just blow it out of the park anymore.  Very bouncy, sturdy (have taken direct hits off the top of the chain-link fence around the park we play in with no issues) and inflate easily.  My go-to kickball for sure.

  Great quality,  holds air good and the rubber seems well made.It‚Äôs a solid kickball, but where it really shines is as a dodgeball. We were playing with my son, and my nieces and nephews, originally with one of those foamy dodgeballs. Then I asked the kids if they wanted to play, ‚Äúold style‚Äù, unwittingly but enthusiastically they collective gave a big, ‚ÄúHell Yeah!‚ÄùNow this ball is bigger than a dodgeball, even seems bigger than the old kickballs, so it made it tough to grip when it was full of air. I Tom Bradyied that sucker and let a bit of air out, just enough so I could grip it but the kids couldn‚Äôt, because life is full of lessons, and ‚Äútrust no one‚Äù is a good one.The grip ridges are perfect, as they allowed me to really get some spin on it, leading to devastating results, they also made really cool imprinted tattoos when you caught them good in an area of bare skin. The accuracy was excellent, as I only had one throw get away from me, drilling my niece in the ear, and taking her off her feet, but she bounced well, and stayed in the game. I really didn‚Äôt dial it up much on the small kids, under 50;pounds, as the size of the ball alone, coupled with the uncontrolled laughter/screaming, was enough to easily take them down with well placed body shots.All in all I was really proud of the kids abilities to take a shot, and subsequent fall, as no one got hurt (other than a minor injury to my throwing shoulder, but the Doc says I should heal up in no time after the surgery) everyone had fun and they have stories to tell for years.

  If I could give these goggles 0 stars, I would.  My daughter is a 6 day a week swimmer and had owned 8 pairs of these over the past 2 years.  She loves how they feel in the water, which is why we continud to repurchase.  However every pair broke in exactly the same way at the nosepiece.  She has gone thru 3 pairs in the past 3 months.  I attempted to contact Speedo directly about this potential product design flaw, but their response was disinterested at best.  We will be a Tyr family from here on out.

  Both of my sons are swimmers and they have been pretty fond of the Speedo Vanquisher 2.0 for the past few years (I've probably bought 10 pairs by now) but this last pair broke about 10 minutes into practice.  The plastic where the nose piece connects to the goggle just snapped and broke completely leaving them absolutely useless.  My son was pretty mad because he had to finish the next 90 minutes with no goggles.  I was not able to return them for some reason but after explaining what happened Amazon issued me a full refund.  3 stars for Speedo and 5 stars for Amazon.

  These are absolutely 5 star quality... Up until 2 years ago, I was a competitive swimmer at a division 3 collegiate level with 16 years of racing under my belt. I have tried most goggles out there like the Swedes and the TYR version but have always made it back to the vanquisher. They are the best for cost, aerodynamics, and feel. For everyone complaining about being too dark, I'm not sure what you're looking for, these are goggles, not corrective lenses. The black line on the bottom of the pool isn't that hard to see. Also, if I had wanted my competition to see my eyes, I would have gotten clear goggles. FYI, no competitive swimmer wears clear goggles.

  Well I normally wear a speed socket model goggle for racing, these goggles are much more padded around the eye socket and are comfortable for longer swims without rubbing your eyes as much. The only compromise there is that they don't adhere to your face quite as well on a entry or start dive. After more than 2,000 hours in the pool, these goggles are still holding up great! Making sure to dry them off and keep him in there and they gobble pouch will further prolong your life as it prevents any dry rotted deterioration of the gasket.

  As a lifelong swimmer, and earnest competitor for many years, I've used myriad performance-oriented goggles. These are my all-time favorite. They're as comfortable as any goggles can be, the silicone seals and straps are durable and effective, and they're low-profile / streamlined so they stay on during dives and fast turns. Additionally, they come in a variety of tints/finishes, so you can get a pair that will work indoor, outdoor, or both. I'm on my third pair.My only complaint is that the inside coating has a tendency to peel off quickly, which effectively ruins the goggles.I'm not talking about the supposedly ""anti-fog"" lenses fogging up - you've got moist eyes, sweat, occasional leaks, and a temperature differential between the air in the goggles and the water outside them. You're going to get fog, eventually, in any goggles. These are no exception.Rather, the film on the inside of the goggles actually peels off, no matter how carefully I baby them. I follow the instructions to never touch the inside surface with my hands, and to rinse with cool tap water after each use. I've tried keeping them in the original blister pack, as well as in a microfiber bag for sunglasses. They always, always peel - and early in their lifespan.I don't want to generate a mound of plastic trash, so I keep using the goggles for years after they've started to peel, until the degraded visibility becomes a functional problem, rather than just an annoyance. That's a testament to how much I like the fit/performance otherwise. Personally, I'd rather have a plain-old plastic lens that fogs up, than these ones with their garbage inner coating that peels raggedly - and then fogs anyway.Regarding fit, the snap-in nose piece works well - once installed, it does it's job reliably for years, without having to touch it again. If you've ever spent an entire afternoon trying to tie the thread on your Swedish goggles exactly right, you'll appreciate this simple and sturdy design from Speedo. If you have to change the size to get the right initial fit, however, it takes a surprising amount of muscle and finesse to remove the stock nose piece. I can't believe that I haven't snapped the goggles when doing this, but so far I'm three-for-three in successfully swapping the nose piece for a different size.Lastly, I just bought a pair of silver mirrored ones, and find that they're dark - really dark. I didn't realize that the lenses were tinted dark gray in addition to the mirrored coating. They're probably great for outdoor swimming, but are not appropriate for indoors, IMO. I'll definitely be going back to clear, non-mirrored lenses when these ones wear out. This doesn't affect my star rating, it's just an FYI, because I didn't understand this from the product page.To Speedo - please fix or remove the awful coating in these goggles. Otherwise, don't change a thing.

  Bought 3 of these for my grandchildren for competition. First meet, two of them broke by the nose strap area. We are left with 1 unused one. Of course, my poor grandchild (See actual event photo) lost that race. We could not return to Amazon because we sent these goggles internationally hoping to depend on a Speedo brand. Reached out to Speedo hoping for a resolution but said, since Amazon is not an authorized seller, that they cannot do anything.  What a waste of time, effort, and money. Horrible experience!!

  Update: 2/27/18:  After about 6 uses, I am seeing some indents where my feet and hands normally are placed.  Not sure if this is premature wearing or not.  Also, it seems this company generates a lot of reviews by offering free samples for giving a review of 100 words or more on their product.  I received a pamphlet with my mat on their warranty and review process, posted a review, and then they sent me an e-mail ""gift claim form"" where I can basically get something for free from them since I provided a review.I purchased this for yoga, based on all the reviews this item has, and so far I've used it 3 times over the past week.  It's worked great so far, and here are my thoughts based on other reviews:1) Squeakiness/noise:  Yes, it does make some noise as I move into different poses.  I do yoga at home, so it doesn't bug me, but I could see it being a problem in a yoga studio or in a group of people.  It doesn't constantly squeak, but as I move my feet around, it does make some noise.  I think it's more the mat and the wooden floor it's on which creates the noise.2) Falling apart: Some reviews mentioned it immediately starts to disintegrate.  I have noticed a couple of strands of rubber come off as I unroll it, but it doesn't seem that bad at all.  I'll update this if it continues to come apart as other reviews had indicated.3) Smell: It smells a little bit, kind of like a latex pillow or other similar rubber/plastic product.  I only noticed it today when I had my face down on it, so it's not strong at all.4) Movement:  I haven't noticed it moving around at all.  It sticks to my wooden floor pretty well, so no complaints there.5) Squishiness: Some people have said it's too thick and they sink into the mat.  I haven't noticed this at all.  Prior to this mat, I was using a thin yoga mat and any time I was on my hands or knees for a long time it was very uncomfortable.  This mat still allows me to do the poses, but much more comfortably than before.

  Came in on time, class tomorrow. I unrolled it and I'm so glad I got the 1/2 inch thickness it feels great on my feet. The mat is very long too which is nice. I love purple so yay on the color. Love the carrying strap, makes it so easy to contain and carry. Can't wait to go to class tomorrow!! There was a small abnormality in the foam but it doesn't go all the through and is no issue at all, you can see in pic it's about the size of the tip of my pinky finger and does effect use of the mat at all.Update: down to 2 stars. The mat is comfy but it's not good. After two uses the rubber looks likes it's starting to break down. The mat moves a lot during a session and squeeks which is annoying and embarrassing. Returned

  I should have listened to the other reviewers!  I bought this mat because I wanted to have less pain while doing exercises like modified pushups or yoga poses that involve contact with my back/knees.  The mat is certainly thick and helped to reduce the amount of pain I felt in my knees and back bones.  HOWEVER, after only a few uses the mat started to tear on its surface.  Moreover, this mat slips really badly!  I have laminate wood floors; however, I also have two other yoga mats in the house and they do NOT slip.

  This mat did not hold up well at all. I do yoga 3X a week and wanted something heavier/thicker for knee support. After a few weeks, it curled up, there are tears along the sides, and it is basically unusable.

  This was my first yoga mat that I purchased.  $10, what a steal, right?  I have laminate floors and I could not do any routines without slipping and stretching the mat all over the place.  I didn't realize how much harder and undesirable a routine could be when you had the extra distraction of a stretchy, slippery mat.  I also thought that thicker would be more comfortable, but I am actually going to try a standard 1/4 inch mat instead of this one because it almost seems too thick.  The only redeeming quality was that I did not experience any tears like other customers, but with the amount of stretching, I could definitely see it happening.  I used this maybe 4 or 5 times but I want to move on to something else at this point.

  I just received this in the mail, and I knew immediately I would like it.  It is incredibly cushioned, which for me is of major importance.  I have bad knees, and regular mats are never cushioned enough for me.  I bruise easily, but this seems like it will prevent any sort of bruising or soreness on my knees or hips.  I don't really do any impact type exercise, so I cannot give a review to it on that.  I do however do Piyo daily, as well as a few other body weight resistance and strengthening exercises, and this has an awesome grip.  No more sliding or falling due to instability issues caused by no traction.  I look forward to being able to do the exercises without fear of a few routines again!  On a side note, I haven't noticed any odd or offensive smells, so that's a bonus!  I am actually considering ordering a second mat for my husband!  He is 6'3, and this seems like it is long enough, and soft enough for his back injury, for him to use as well

  ok, this is the first yoga mat I've ever purchased, so I don't have others to compare it too.  First off, I'm not an avid yoga practitioner--I just wanted something with enough cushioning to pad my bones on a hard floor.  This def'ly does that--it is very cushiony and soft.  one side is completely smooth and the other is slightly corrugated.  I assumed smooth was for the down side, and used it that way.  Had no problems with slipping at all.  I see that others have had issues with tears.  I can see where that could happen--the foam is very soft.  It is in fact softer, that I expected for something labeled high density.  However, since every other pad I saw in stores was only a 1/4"" thick for the same price,  I am very happy with it so far.Edit--I should have added, you'll need to be sure your floor and shoes are clear of any grit--the foam is soft enough that any odd bits of stuff are going to imbed into it.

The balls bounce true and work as expected.  All 50 balls came shipped in a box that is now doubling at the storage bin.  None were damaged on arrival.  We keep it the storage bin next to the ping pong table and when a ball goes flying out of play or gets lost the kids just reach and grab a new one.

  Have a slightly tackier feel to them than the more expensive big brand balls. The weight and size is on par...the balls bounce well. So if you are OK with the tackier feel (better spin because of grip, if you ask me) than that of the smoother balls, get these. What a great deal. 5/5

  You can never have too many ping pong balls. And if you play table tennis with kids, you can double that advice. These are solid balls that bounce and spin well. They have a crisp feel off the paddle, and ping smartly off of the table. They also stand up to wicked spikes and hard forehand slams.I‚Äôm an amateur player, and I like these balls. At .20 cents each, they are a decent value for a 40mm ball. You can keep the game moving without having to constantly retrieve balls. For 10 bucks, it‚Äôs a good buy for 50 balls.

  What a great price for these balls.  Around $.20 a piece, which is probably 5-10 times cheaper than buying a pack of 3 at a random store.  The balls themselves are a good color orange, are spherically symmetrical (you'd think that should be a given, but those cheaper balls are not very spherical, especially 1-star balls), and are a good hardness to give some weight to your games.  After several games of smashing the balls you might crack them, but they last a long time.  Will buy these again if I ever end up breaking them all.

(When we moved him out of his house, he had so many clocks it wasn‚Äôt funny, often more than one on a surface.)All I wanted was a clearly readable time, plus the date and day of the week in a hopefully reliable watch. I narrowed my search down to three watches that varied in cost from $13 to $70. We leaned toward digital because I read that as their memory got worse, people often become unable to understand the analog clock face and benefit from just having the actual time in digits.Of these three watches, two are outstanding, and one is good if the person‚Äôs vision is still good enough. I expect that all will require us to set the time if it should need changing for any reason. I‚Äôm giving Dad all three, although the first two in the list were immediate hits.Here are the watches and why I chose them:

  I was looking for a waterproof watch with large numbers so that I can easily glance down and track my time while running and riding my horse. This watch meets those needs and more. The first day wearing it, I bathed my horse, which included submerging my wrist into a 5-gallon bucket repeatedly. No issue! Watch still looks and works good as new. I'm very impressed with how easy it is to set and how adjustable the band is. This watch is seemingly indestructible and even appears more expensive than it really is. As an added bonus, I like that it includes the day of the week and the date as well as easy-to-use timer and stopwatch features. I'm sure there are a few more features that I haven't discovered yet.

  It's a great watch. I decided to get the watch after watching some amazing review videos on YouTube some time ago.FEATURES:Hourly chime(optional). One alarm. Chronograph(stopwatch) with split times(no lap memory). 12 and 24 hour time modes, and features the date, month, and day of the week(no year). It DOES NOT have any countdown timer.PROS:The watch fits very well. It's very comfortable to wear.The light function is very bright, and provides excellent visibility. This watch lights up brighter than my new Timex with the indiglo.It's waterproof. I've only had it for a couple days so far, but I've showered, washed my hands, and washed dishes with it on and haven't had an issue.CONS:The only con is that it doesn't track the year, so no leap years.NOTES ON OTHER REVIEWERS' COMPLAINTS:Some complain that the face is hard to read, because at an angle, the full [number print?] of the display comes in to view, and the screen ""turns to gibberish"". It's true that if you hold it at a weird angle, it becomes unreadable, but all LCD displays of this type do that; calculators, watches, and anything else. I've included a picture to show what I'm talking about.(Note the weird angle at which I'm holding the watch in the photo, nobody checks their watch this way.) This claim is ridiculous and unreasonable, as long as you have the watch pointed at you when you're looking at it, like normal, then it's not a problem at all. Maybe, these people are trying to perform some kind of acrobatic feat, or check the time during a yoga pose, but when you're actually LOOKING AT the watch, the display is perfect.Also, for those people who complain that every time you cycle the modes, it gives you the option to set the time, press the reset button while on the chronograph, or otherwise changing any setting, that eliminates this problem. Though, I don't know why they're pressing buttons to change mode if they're not using the stopwatch or alarm.A few people here will give you the impression that it's a huge watch, but that's not the case. The fit is surprisingly comfortable.Unlike some will tell you, the watch DOES NOT beep when you press the light button, that is absolutely untrue.

  Great product. You can't get more bang for your buck.I needed a watch or the outdoors, hiking, that I wouldnt mind roughing up and that was waterproof and very readable and strong LED light. The LED display did not disappoint. I confirm that at a certain angle the only thing you will see is 88:88....but I mean it is really irrelevant to me....Another important factor for me was the bracelet and whether I'd sweat like a pig. I ve worn it in 100 F condition and it was not different than any other watches that I own...In summary. Cheap, simple, bright LED, does chrono, alarm etc...

  I bought this for practices with my 7-8 year old soccer team. It's a little smaller than our regulation goals but it gives them a target to work with.  It's fine for practice but I have a couple complaints:1. It's put together with like tent poles that you thread through the net.  The joints on the tent poles are a little lose so when moving it around they come apart and you have to put it back together.  This set up also makes taking the tent poles out of the net a real pain so I normally just transport it with the bottom connectors off and it folded in half.  Not a big deal but if you have a smaller car that won't work.2. There is a strap between the two bottom braces that connect the top pole to the bottom pole.  Which that is nice so you can't lose your bottom braces but it's really impractical in the soccer goal.  At least once a practice I have a kid that gets tripped by that strap.3. This isn't overly durable.  It would probably honestly work better if you are just using it around the house with one kid.  My team of 11 has put this through the ringer and it shows.  I've got seams unraveling on the net.  They managed to flip the net with a very hard goal kick which caused the nylon loop you are supposed to use to anchor it to rip off.  We've only used this for 4 practices.  It's getting the job done but I don't know how many seasons I'll really get out of this.

  I was able to use duct tape to make this product sturdy and useful.I read the reviews that questioned the sturdiness of this product but I bought it anyway. I've since used it in 5 practices with U8 boys and this is what I've learned. The first practice showed me that as it is, it does not have the sturdiness to withstand the constant assault that boys will unleash on it. The straight connectors are too shallow. Merely kicking the ball in the net is enough to dislodge it.So I took it home after the first practice and tightly duct taped the straight connectors together. I did not connect the corner connectors because they are deep (3"" or so) and I did want some movement so as not to break anything. That did the trick.4 practices later and these nets have withstood everything without an issue. The kids lay on it, kick it, roll into it and it hasn't given up. It stays together. Now it's perfect.I'll never put it back into the small carrying bag again but that's okay. It folds up into a compact size for travel. So I'm now happy with this product.Again, you will need duct tape to make this product sturdy and useful. Otherwise it will constantly separate at the side connectors. Definitely happy that I bought this... After my improvement.

  Upon initial opening in building I loved it it was amazing it‚Äôs the perfect size it folds together nice and neat. The first time we went to use it I was on able to get the top to snap together when I looked at it it had snapped off inside the bracket. So I pulled the broken piece out and put it back together and put it away. We went to use it again the same piece was broken again so I am very disappointed that the top bar keeps breaking. Lost an inch off the top due do it breaking twice. $20 for one goal is already expensive and now the fact that he keeps breaking is really pissing me off.

  I bought this soccer net for my children because it seems like good quality for the price. It came in a very tiny box and it is at that point it should‚Äôve been suspicious. The instructions are very vague, it took me about 25 minutes to assemble the product. The entire soccer net is much smaller than appears in the product picture, and it is very flimsy. My kids will surely be kicking through this and knocking it over (even with the stakes). The biggest upset about the net is the fact that on each side the support strings are completely frayed and falling apart. Came like that right out of the box. I‚Äôve only had this net for about 30 minutes, the kids have not even used it yet and I can already tell it‚Äôs going to be falling apart by next week. Do not buy!

  Unfortunately, and somewhat painfully, the low-quality metal used in the linked rods of this product shave off into sharp micro-fibers, as a result of the friction of sliding them together or apart to assemble or disassemble the goal. These metal fibers lodged in my fingers, producing a splinter sensation that lasted a couple days. I thought not much of it, but then, weeks later, my young daughter had the same thing happen to her (she really likes putting the rods together, to make the goal). These very small metal shavings remained in her skin for a day or so, and were painful.Bottom line: it's a cheap product, for a reason. The metal shaves off and doesn't easily wipe away. Disappointed with the quality here.

  This is a good weight, thick and durable mat, for anyone needing extra protection while exercising.  It's a must for me due to some spinal irregularities needing comforting support.  Heck, you can end your routine with a quick nap on it, as well.  It's that comfy.The missing star is for the terrible off-gasing that I had to deal with on arrival.  The smell was so strong that I had to get it out of the house. I placed it in the garage, opened and stretched out for full airing.  My goodness, when I walked in the garage, it smelled just like my visits to the local Discount Tires. I even burned some incense to try to mask it, but the smell won.So, if you have patience you will really like this mat.  It's a good value for the comfort and durability.  The smell will eventually dissipate, but it will take a good while.

  After reading all the positive reviews, I bought this mat for physio therapy and maybe some yoga.When it arrived the smell was pretty overpowering but I figured it would subside with time.Nope.I have used this mat twice since purchase in November 2017 and it is now the end of April 2018 (6 months).The first time I used it, my clothes smelled so bad from lying on the mat that I had to change out of them hours later. The second time I used the mat, I placed a towel down first. But the smell was so terrible that I could not focus or finish my physio therapy. Six months of owning this mat, and the smell is just as strong, and just as unbearable.Yes, it is on the less expensive side as far as exercise mats go, but my suggestion would be to put that money towards a higher quality mat.I am going to have to throw this mat away, and the money I invested, right along with it.

  This approximately 3/4 inch thick mat is 'comfy' for this 71-year-old guy: I am overweight but I don't 'bottom out' on this.  The foam is flexible enough to unroll and to roll up again and again with ease.  The elasticized sling carrier has held up well and stretches easily enough to that the roll doesn't have to be wrapped as tight as possible for things to work.  I do find that the foam is 'tender' in that sharp stones and the like will harm it...but used indoors (or on a ground cloth or tent floor for camping) this is a great product!  I am very pleased that I found it and I believe that many shoppers who have similar needs will feel the same way!

  The maintenance of your treadmill is easily overlooked & sometimes totally forgotten. One of the most important pieces of maintenance that is relatively simple & which does not take much time to perform, is cleaning & lubricating the belt. Spot On 100% Silicone Treadmill Belt Lubricant is a must have for my treadmill. Made in the USA is a bonus. The extra long application tube makes applying the lubricant under the treadmill belt & across the treadmill platform very easy.To properly lubricate the treadmill belt, you must first clean the underside of the belt & the top of the treadmill platform. To do this, loosen the belt tensioning screws until you are able to slide a dry clean towel under the belt & across the platform. Carefully run the towel from one end of the platform to the other & then back to the center. Carefully (you may need someone helping you) while holding the towel across the center of the platform, turn the belt on its slowest speed, so it runs over the towel wiping clean the underside of the belt. Remove the towel. Now take the Spot On Silicon Lubricant w/the long application tube attached, apply approximately 1oz of lube across the treadmill platform. Retighten the treadmill belt being sure to center the belt. Once tightened, turn the treadmill on a slow speed & walk on the treadmill to allow the lube to spread across the platform. That‚Äôs it.It will depend on how often you use your treadmill as to how often you‚Äôll need to lubricate your treadmill. I use my treadmill 4-7 times a week. I lube my treadmill every 3 months, so the bottle of Spot On lasts a year. You should check your manual or manufacturer‚Äôs website to see if silicone lube is right for your treadmill & how often it should be lubricated.Thank you for taking time to read my review, I hope it was helpful.

  Worked Great on my Pro-Form 300 treadmill belt, and also, Thanks to the person who suggested the drinking straw (See Attached Picture) this helps to keep oiler line straighter, and makes it much easier to apply. I used a 3/8"" wood dowl rod and fed it under belt to lift from walking surface. It opened the gap, and allowed a good enough clearance to see and apply oil...(and to the person that had issue of oil coming out when squeezing bottle. ?) Well this, as with almost all liquid products does have a cap seal that needs to be removed too. Just a FYI

  Well,Can't figure out how people have trouble applying this lube.  It works like piece of cake.  Just lift the belt and insert the tube in and pull out as you squeeze leaving lube behind.  If you can't lift the belt, it's probably too tight in the first place.  Then to the other side and do the same.  When the package arrives the tube is bent, but it straightens easily and the process couldn't be easier.  As for the lube, it seems to work just fine, the belt noise is reduced and the belt lag is eliminated.  In fact, I loosened the belt some so it wasn't so tight and it seems to run better than ever.  For a 30 yr old treadmill to have new life is a good thing.  Now if they invented an effective lube for my 70 yr old body, we'd be better yet.  Good product, super easy application, don't hesitate to buy this lubricant.  My treadmill is a Proform 525E model, instruction book says to not use lubricant, but in fact they sell a lubricant if you need one so take that with a grain of salt.

  There were complaints that the tube is not rigid enough. It is not enough to force it under the belt. So, slip a piece of cardboard under the center of the belt, and then slide the tube in next to it, since there will be no resistance it easily goes to the center of the belt. Did that, and the process was very easy and quick.

  My treadmill has been stored in our basement since we moved into this house 3 years ago.  When I had it moved upstairs to the den, I could feel that it was dry under the belt.  When I turned on the machine, it was louder than I remembered so I did some on line research and discovered this Silicone Treadmill Belt Lubricant.  I watched a You Tube film showing how to use the product and found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price.I used it as soon as it arrived applying it liberally under the belt with the applicator tube that was included.  It was very easy to use!  It worked very well and within minutes after lubricating the belt and walking on it for awhile, the noise was gone.  The belt moves more smoothly as well.  I will use  it again as needed and recommend it to other treadmill owners.

  ¬†I think the product works? I‚Äôve used it twice so far. My only concern is that the small black tip on the applicator straw, can accidentally come off under the belt ,when you‚Äôre lubricating it .if there‚Äôs a little pressure on the belt As you pull the straw out with the bottle ,that little black cap can come off. It happened to me and I had to get some thing to slip it under the belt to swish it out. Beware My cats use the treadmill every night so it seems to help. I gave it three stars because I was afraid that tip would have gotten stuck under the belt and jammed up my whole treadmill. Just letting you know to be aware!

  These cards seem to be made of teflon coated sheet steel.  They are so stiff it is impossible to do a bridge shuffle, even with the cards split in 2 stacks of 26 cards they cannot be bent enough to riffle.  They also seem to be coated with something along the lines of nylon or teflon.  They are so slick that if you set the deck down on an uneven surface cards will just slide off the stack.  The face of the cards have a knitted pattern of threads in squares.  I have taken cards and flexed and flexed and flexed to try to soften them up to no avail.  With the slick plastic coating they should be waterproof.If you wanted to do card tricks or shuffle tricks steer clear of these.  They are far to slick to be manipulated artfully.  You cannot fan them out because the cards have to be held by hands, card to card surface will just slip and slide like they are oiled.These would be great cards for grade school age kids, they seem like they will be indestructible and waterproof with the thick nylon/plastic coating.

  Me and the fellas have our poker sessions about 4 times a year.  We go through packs of cards rather quickly due to the drinking and smoking that goes on during play.  A little alcoholic spillage here, a cigar or cigarette burn there . . .  oh well.  The font and pictures on the cards are standard and easy to read.

Have a smooth finish, perfect for shuffling. We have used one deck for a little over 2 months and they are already peeling to where you know what card your partner has because of the purple color that comes through.For the price of all these decks it's not a bad deal- but we will go back to using the old casino cards when we go through all the decks we bought and didn't give to kids for college

  Immediately upon inserting the needle to pump up a ball, air started escaping. I only managed to pump the ball to a somewhat adequate level by pumping like mad.

I will be returning this and purchasing a new pump, so I can start pumping balls again

  I coach Middle School Football and we can never seem to have enough of these small, inexpensive hand pumps around for those refs that believe we may be attempting to ""Brady Ball"" them. This particular unit saved us from having to turn around a bus midway to a game to get another pump as we inflated one of our game balls in route, but it only worked once... Then its inflating days were behind it, I believe a seal popped on it.

  The pump itself is of poor quality, broke after 3 uses.  Don't plan for this thing to last too long.  It seems there is a whatever makes up the pressure mechanism inside cannot handle much pressure at all, and breaks after a less than typical task.  The only good thing is that it does come with a couple needles and other accessories, which are probably worth the amount paid for the package.  Oh well, lesson learned.

  I bought this, not for physical therapy purposes, but so I could tape my knockers so they didn‚Äôt pop out of my bridesmaids dress. They worked wonderfully!!

  Ok, so this tape is magical.  Seriously, there must be some fairy dust or produced by the gods of endurance to work as well as it does.  Why do I say this?  I just finished a 2700 mile self supported mountain bike race.  I had never used this tape but have had issues with one of my knees for years.  I've been to orthopedists, physical therapists, etc.  Had shots of different substances but never received complete relief.Well, after one day into this race I had ridden 100 miles and my knee was acting up.  I decided, what the hell, I'll give this stuff a shot.  I taped my knee as stated in the little guide it shipped with and then next day I rode 140 miles...with no pain.  I was amazed but thought that maybe it was a placebo effect?? Then I rode the next day, and the next and so forth.  27 day 100+ mile days with no pain. Amazing!I know this sounds like an infomercial but this tape saved my race and I am super happy with it.  I could wear it for around 5 days in a row and then had to replace it.I also had some achillies tendon problems during the race and used this tape.  It helped a little but no where near what it did for my knee.I picked this brand because, quite frankly, it was less expensive than some of the others and came in a roll...which was nice so that I could cut it to size.  I highly recommend this tape.

  I'm using this over my healing burn scars on my chest- I was in a bonfire accident and suffered 10% burn to my chest and right arm.  In physical therapy, they were sending me home with kinesiology tape over the scars to promote flattening and softening.  While it worked, the tape wouldn't stick well and I'd have to wear high neck tops to keep it from peeling off completely.  I decided to order my own so that I could at least have fresh stuff on hand to reapply each day.  This is so much higher quality than I received at the burn center!  It sticks so well and it doesn't make me itch or burn like the other stuff.  It stretches well and doesn't fall off after my shower!  Highly recommend and I'm even bringing this with me to pt for now on so the doctors can use this tape instead.  Super satisfied and will likely reorder if I need to!

  I used this tape to hold up my DD breasts in a custom-made evening gown that was VERY open. It works!!!!! The BEST lift EVER, and I danced all night and sat by a fire pit. My advice: Plan your best methods to lift them in your garment and measure BEFORE you apply the tape. And I used coconut oil to soak the tape off overnight before I EASILY peeled it off the following day. DO NOT RIP THIS TAPE OFF YOUR SKIN! It will take your skin with it.

  This stuff is virtually identical to the popular KT Tape and Rock Tape, but cheaper and comes in more colors. I got this individual roll and loved it so much I just purchased a bulk roll (which btw is about 50% cheaper in the long run!) I personally use adhesive tape for binding my chest, and it does exactly what I want. If you do things ahead of time to make it last longer (isopropyl alcohol on the skin first, not stretching the last inch at the ends of the tape, and rubbing it for a few minutes after applying) it will last several days. Some folks can make it last for weeks. Be sure not to rip the tape off like a bandaid... Remove it gently in the shower because it WILL give you a blister or take off layers of skin (yes it is THAT adhesive!).

  My fitbit malfunctioned and was out of warranty so I needed another tracker.  This one had good ratings and had what I wanted (it actually has more features that I currently use!).  If you want a fancy tons of bells and whistles that is like an apple watch, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something comparable to a $100 dollar fitness tracker, you will be HAPPY!  I mainly use this for time (it is a watch afterall!)  and to track my steps.  I think it is actually more accurate the my previous more expensive device.  I also LOVE the fact that the time display is larger (since I use reading glasses) and the display is easier to read in daylight compared to the more expensive tracker.  The heartrate feature takes a few seconds before a heartrate is displayed (compared to the instant display on a fitbit) but that is the only ""issue"" I have found .  The heartrate also appears to be very accurate.  The features I have not yet used are connected to the app.  The watch will alert you to phone calls and text messages. It will also track your exercise (bike, walk, run) and your sleep..  I have not enabled these features yet.  For more petite women, you may want to purchase a smaller wrist band (I am using the very first hole on the band)I have had the watch about a month and so far have been very pleased!  It charges well (and more easily than the more expensive tracker). From my experience, it also holds a charge for a bit longer ( a little over a week).  For people like me who do not need tons of fancy stuff but appreciate a reliable product, this is the perfect watch!

  I bought the black Letscom tracker after my Fitbit Zip died and I found out they no longer manufacture them. Not gonna lie, I would have bought another Zip if I found it used for about $20, but the Zips on eBay were selling for around $50, which is much more than I'm willing to pay for a used, outdated fitness tracker.Anyway, after researching different options I settled on the Letscom tracker. I liked that it was only $30 which is big for me because I don't have lots of disposable income to throw around.Although I'm not a big fan of the ""watch"" aspect, I'm getting used to wearing one again. I would much prefer if they had a way to clip it to your belt, but I can't seem to find a clip accessory. Hopefully they'll offer it in the future.Honestly, I only bought this thing for it's step tracking abilities. There are a bunch of other features that I basically ignore. I've tested ""run mode"" and ""bike mode"" and they work just fine but I never use them. Who knows? Maybe I'll change my mind someday. I guess it's good that I have the option.Things I like about this tracker:* It's super accurate when counting steps. I figured I was wasting my money on this tracker buying from a relatively unknown company. I'm happy to admit that I was wrong. It does a great job accurately counting steps.* I appreciate that it's waterproof up to a point. They say don't wear it in the shower or swimming pool and I don't. But I'm glad that I can still wear it while washing my hands. I have a weak bladder and pee a lot throughout the day. It's much easier being able to wash my hands while wearing the watch instead of having to take it off 7-10 times a day whenever I use the rest room.* It was easy to connect to the app on my phone. Sometimes pairing Bluetooth devices to your phone can be a downright pain the neck. This paired on the first try and hasn't needed to be re-paired once since I've been using it for more than a month now. My Bluetooth scale needs to get paired again at least 3 times a week, which is super annoying. So kudos for making an easy device that actually works!* The watch is thin and not too bulky or heavy. I don't like wearing watches. I have no problem admitting it. And it took some getting used to with this watch. But because it's thin and light, it didn't take too long to feel normal. I'd still prefer a belt clip, but this is okay since I have no other choice.* It's pretty easy to charge. I know it says it will last a week. Mine doesn't go quite as long. I usually have to charge it every 3 days which isn't too bad. Pulling off the watch band and plugging it in to a USB port is really easy. And it charges in less than an hour, which is great.That's about all I have to say about the Letscom watch fitness tracker. This review went a lot longer than I anticipated.All in all, this is a good tracker that I'm glad I bought. I miss the online community aspect with Fitbit, so maybe they'll create one in the future. Besides that, if you want an inexpensive, accurate, easy to use step counter and fitness tracker this is a great option. I highly recommend it.

  I love this product so much. I bought a second one for my mom. It isnt ultra hi tech but it does everything you need to. It counts steps, heart rate etc. It tells the time and can also link to your phone for calls and texts.I bought this to see if I would use it and if I could justify paying for an apple watch. I also convinced two of my co workers to buy them too! You only need to charge it every 5 days or so and when it does need to be charged it charges in about 30 mins.The customer support is also awesome. Two of the bands broke and they replaced them immediately for me.

  I got these for my 1 and 3 yr old daughters. They are amazing. Not to sound so cliched, but I‚Äôve never written a review before and I felt compelled to do so now because these floaties have changed our lives this summer. Both the 1 and 3 yr old can float next to us in the water. They are safe. They girls can keep their heads up independently. And if one gets out of the pool to toddle around on the deck, I‚Äôm not chasing right behind them, paranoid that at any moment I‚Äôll have to dive in the pool and scoop someone up. I love these. The product says it‚Äôs for a child with a minimum weight of 30 lbs. Neither of my daughters have hit 30 lbs yet but these are adjustable and fit snugly, even around my 21 lb one year old. There is extra fabric at the shoulders, but that does not prevent the float from doing its job. My girls love these and I do too!

  If you‚Äôre looking for a beginner floatie jacket for your toddler, you have found it! My daughter is 13 months old, walking, and tall but very thin. She weighs about 18 lbs, so I was worried about finding one of these jackets that would fit snugly around her chest/trunk. This was a perfect fit and worked great in the pool. It‚Äôs helping to teach her to keep her head up and kick her legs to propel herself. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give this jacket 5 stars is that the girl patterns are kind of ugly. We went with hula girl, but none of the girl ones were nice and the boy ones were really boy ish. How about some gender neutral ones? That would be nice.

  I have been searching for a swimmy like this for some time now for my 2yr old! I like his regular puddle jumper but it would sag & he was able to remove his arms from it when out of the water and that made me nervous. Tried this one today, as soon as it was delivered, and it‚Äôs AMAZING. It fits tighter than his puddle jumper even though it says 30-50lbs (he only weighs 23lbs). So happy I got this one. And he loves it too! If you‚Äôre questioning it because of the weight recommendations (just like I did), it‚Äôs definitely worth trying! I couldn‚Äôt even tighten it all the way (unlike his other puddle jumper). Fits super snug.

  My 16 month old loves to jump in the pool with her big sisters, so we needed to find something for her to wear! Typical life jackets for infants are much too bulky and she couldn't kick around and swim.  Puddle jumpers worked, but made us a little nervous as she's so young and could take her arms out.  I saw this shoulder strap style on another child and bought it to try out.  It works well when we cinch it as tight as it goes.  She loves being able to ""swim""! My only complaint is she weighs 22 lbs, and no company makes these for under 30! So it is a little big on her, even though it works.  Wish I could buy one for a smaller child.

  We borrowed one of these on a trip where there was a swimming pool. My 2 year old is able swim on her own in the water and stay afloat. I had originally brought our super amazing lifejacket, but it kept putting her on her back like it should in an emergency. This was not what I wanted in the pool. I love that these are an approved PFD. These also have shoulders to keep the kiddos from taking them off on their own, which is what we need with a toddler who seems to get in/out of everything she is wearing. She goes to the pool for family swim almost weekly and this always comes with. Highly recommended!

  This product is nothing short of amazing, first off my daughter is 20 months old and around 28-30 lbs. It fits her so well and is tight enough around her little body. She is secure in the life jacket, it does NOT slip all around or off. The raised chest piece helps keep her head and body in an upright position. As well as the arm pieces. This is made out of a foam like layers so you do not have to worry about it popping like traditional ""arm floats"" which I do NOT recommend for younger kids what so ever. Hope this help a mommy or daddy looking for something safe for their young babies to enjoy the water. As always use caution in any water with children. This is my second purchase just so the designs on the life jackets are so cute. And the price point $20-$25, TO SAVE YOUR CHILD in and around water.. Priceless !

  I bought these for my dog who became addicted to a practice ball he found when we went walking on our local ballfield. I don‚Äôt know what brand he found there, but the leather on the mystery ball is much thicker and more durable than these. That said, these are not meant for kids to be chewing on. I think the leather would hold up just fine if you were using it for its intended use. So don‚Äôt go by my score. If you buy these for your dog to chew on, slip them down into an old sock. Ralphie loves his Ball Sack, especially since he doesn‚Äôt have one of his own. Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç And putting the ball inside the sock makes the leather last longer, a win-win for us both!

  I do a boxing class at least 3 times a week for 2 hours.  I‚Äôve tried a few brands; so far, these are one the best hand wraps I‚Äôve used next to Everlast.  *My Everlast lasted over a year; it started to shred and broke into two pieces. But no issues with the velcro or any of the thumb loops.  *I tried Ringside; the velcro started to come off after the second use.  The thumb loop started to break off after less than 2 months.They are long, stretchy, soft, and not too thick.  I‚Äôm still able to wear them comfortably with my boxing gloves without any issues.  No problem with the velcro or the thumb loops.When cleaning, I sometimes hand wash them and air dry them after each use.  When I do wash them in the machine; I put the wraps in the mesh bag and air dry.

  These are a little thinner than the ones my gym sells (9Round) but work well and have just the right amount of stretch. The ONLY complaint I have is that there is no marking denoting the surface to put against the skin when you start wrapping, so if you don't start it right the velcro closure won't close right. No big deal, and what do you expect for an inexpensive wrap, but just giving you info in case that matters to you.

  Excellent quality hand wraps at a much better price point than I could find locally. I picked up one pair, but I'll probably buy another soon for the days I want to wash them. These make a great gift for any combat sports practitioner.Pros:- Slightly stretchy material doesn't cut off my circulation as easily as standard hand wraps- Super comfortable material- Thumb loop doesn't rub the inside of my finger (bad experience with different ones)- Bright color choices if that's your thing (I went with Black to match all my other gear)- No weird Ace bandage smellCons:- I'll never have the patience to wrap them back up all nice so they will just be loose in my gym bagIt's really important to have a good wrapping technique. If you're not sure, watch some YouTube videos and try out a few methods until you find one you like.

  My favorite wraps, of all the main brands. I bought wraps from each of the popular companies on Amazon (Sanabul, Meister, Everlast, Ringside, and Pro Impact) and tested each of them. I found that Sanabul & Meister wraps are very similar.. They're soft and feel well made. They don't feel too thin and have held up quality-wise use-after-use. Tied for first place!In second place behind Sanabul & Meister, are Ringside Mexican Style wraps, which are also really nice. The main difference is that Ringside wraps are stiffer, so it's really a matter of preference and I don't think you'd go wrong with any of those three options.Third place goes to Everlast, which I would not recommend as they are low quality and tend to fall apart quite quickly. And last place are the Pro Impact wraps, which were extremely uncomfortable and scratchy...

  Wow they feel great! I‚Äôm going to test them tonight at the boxing gym. I received the set this afternoon and wrapped one hand. The feel is uncredibe; soft, breathable and easy to secure. They have elastic so the fit is asjustable and you don‚Äôt have to unwrap to rewrap which clearly saves time. The fact the fit is adjustable is worth five stars alone. My boxing coach said to get 180‚Äô inch wraps since I used 108‚Äô. My previous three sets (all Title brand) are tattered and ruined. They really don‚Äôt last very long but it‚Äôs ok because they serve as a knee wrap. I actually wrapped my knee with one this past Saturday. I purchased Title wraps because that‚Äôs the only brand found at the store. Title is a sound brand no questions about their standing but their inexpensive hand-wraps don‚Äôt hold up long. I‚Äôve gone thru three sets in two months. They‚Äôre still wearable but the material is stressed, stained and unraveling. My Sanabul 14oz gloves are awesome so I‚Äôm confident their wraps won‚Äôt disappoint. As for gloves and wraps, Sanabul is my go-to for boxing supplies.

  These came really fast, are very comfortable while doing their job, and are well made. The finished wrap is supportive and the Velcro at the wrist is just the right size. I am a female with fairly small hands, and these feel adequate in length without going on forever. I would buy these again. I got black, and the finished wrap has a nice black and grey label, which looks nice.

  This is the first time I'm trying out elastic wraps.  Previously I've only had not-so-stretchy cotton wraps, not because of preference but because that's what I picked up from my gym.  While the cotton wraps provided good support and protection, I hated how it would get so rancid after just one workout.  Since I started working out 5-6 times a week, I decided to try out different ones to use throughout the week, rather than washing the same pair every day.I am, by no means, an athlete or a fighter.  I'm just a dude trying to get in shape and lose weight.  I do cardio kickboxing 5-6 times a week, about 30 mins at a time.  There are about 3-4 rounds of heavy bag type work where you actually need the support.  The rest of the time its different full body workouts, but you just have your handwraps on.The wraps are very soft and seem to be sturdy.  The stitching doesn't look like it will get undone anytime soon, but we'll see in a few months.I realize I do need to apply these wraps a little tighter than I would on the cotton wraps.  The first time I used it, I ended up tweaking my right wrist a little.  I'm not going to fault the wrap just yet, because I do believe I didn't wrap my hands tight enough.  I am able to wrap my hands tighter with these wraps without worrying about cutting off circulation.One small thing, which I don't care personally, is that there is a slight color difference between the pair.  The picture shows the wraps after 1 wash.  It is more noticeable in person, but again, not that big of a deal.

  My car battery was discharged to the point that my Battery Tender Plus 1.25A charger/maintainer would not even attempt to charge it. I purchased a Noco Genius5 charger/maintainer that has successfully charged my battery without requiring that I activate Noco's 'force mode' that will charge a battery that has become discharged to 0 volts.Below are three points to keep in mind if you decide to buy a Noco charger/maintainer.1. Select the correct Noco for your battery. Each Noco is rated for a certain number of Amp-hours (Ah). The Genius2 is rated for 40Ah, the Genius5 is rated for 120Ah, and the Genius10 is rated for 230Ah. My car battery's capacity is 92Ah, so the Genius2 would not be able to fully charge it; however, the Genius5 is able to fully charge it.2. Be patient because the Noco may require longer to charge your battery than the owner's manual suggests, for two reasons. First, the '25% charge' step includes a de-sulfation process that can take some time - for my discharged battery, more than 24 hours were required for this step. Second, the '100% charge' step includes an optimization process that can also take some time. So, whereas the Noco spent only a few hours in each of the '50% charge' and '75% charge' steps, the '25% charge' and '100% charge' steps required more time.3. As the Owner's Manual indicates, you MUST disconnect your battery from your vehicle prior to activating 12V Repair mode; otherwise, you risk damaging your vehicle's electronics.

  I purchased this because one of the customer questions on Amazon was answered by the manufacturer as follows:Question: Can I use this to maintain the charge in my car and leave it unattended for months during winter storage?Answer:Yes, it can safely maintain a battery all winter long.By NOCO Support MANUFACTURER  on December 9, 2019However, as you will see on the cover page of the user manual (image attached) it says not to use it unattended. (I added the red highlight in the attached picture.)I'm sure that it will probably work, but the point is that this is not a must-have purchase. I bought it for peace of mind and convenience on a car that would be stored through the winter. However, that peace of mind is out the window if the manufacturer feels they need to make a disclaimer upfront.Bottom line, it may work as  charger, but it is not (according to the manufacturer's manual) recommended to maintain batteries unattended. I suppose the battery maintainer portion is technically true if you are willing to move into your garage and sleep with your car during the winter months [grin].

  This brought back the battery in my truck (year old or so battery). I drive it 2-3 times a week to keep it chrged and all that (not a daily). One day I came out to zero volts. It sat that way for a week, and no regular charger could keep it alive more than a few hours. I used the force feature to start it, and once it said it was ""charged"" I switched it to recovery. Might be some damage in the life, but it starts like new.

  I have a year 2002 BMW car that's driven infrequently. On several occasions when I went to use it, the battery was weak and was just able to start car. So I bought the NOCO GENIUS5, which is a perfect match for the cars battery type and capacity characteristics. The NOCO GENIUS5 restored the car battery to full charge, and is now operating in maintenance mode. With the GENIUS5, now when I need the car, its ready to go.

  I've recharged/repaired the batteries in all my vehicles - two of which are approaching 3 years old. All batteries now start my vehicles as if they are brand new. It's really nice to use as a tender on our weekend car, because it takes up so little space. I'm very happy with this purchase and will probably purchase a smaller version for use with my motorcycle.

  This charger was able to get a troublesome battery all the way up to float voltage (fully charged) with no problem.  I had two old chargers that simply couldn't do it, and they are much heavier and bigger.The design and build quality on this Noco charger is great.  Compact size, high output, excellent quality cables and clamps.  Even the packaging was impressive.

  Despite what my liberal arts-educated self hoped, these things operate on plain old evaporation and not some magical cooling properties.I never thought I would buy these and considered them useless, until I had a toddler who overheats at the drop of (her) hat. These cloths help a lot! I wet them and keep them in a ziplock baggie in the car whenever we go to the park or hiking in the summer. When they‚Äôre needed, I just wring , snap, and proceed to being cooled.I even use these for myself after a run- if they work to cool me, they‚Äôll work for anyone!Definitely recommend!

  I'm an avid biker (motorcycle) and living in the south it can be a tad unbearable at a stop light or being stuck in traffic in the high 90s with feels like temps in the 100s. I figured let's check a chance and see if these help. Our usual rides last for 4 hours and we stop at the end of a bridge half way to hang out on a seawall. I thought it would be perfect as we can dip our towels in and sit on the seawall with the sun at our backs and not melt away lol. They WORK! I don't how how, but WOW. Sitting on a seawall in the blaring sun in the summer after riding in the heat for a couple hours gets your body temp up. I have Epilepsy and I'm heat sensative and these help me ride in the summer. The coolness lasts for maybe 45 min on the ride back maybe because the wind dries it out fast, so we stop at a beach to recharge them for the rest of the ride home.While the colors of these aren't exactly what a 'biker' would choose, they do what they are intended to do. I'll buy more seeing we lost one on our last ride lol. They are the perfect length to spread across your shoulders or back and fold up small enough to fit in my leg bag.

  I guess I'm not sure what the hype over these were. They are just like a regular hand towel. You wet it, and it keeps you wet until it dries like a regular hand towel I will say it was very absorbent. I made a spill and just happened to have one of these around me. I used it to clean up a spill and it worked splendidly for that.

  I get nausea and dizzy when I overheat.  Without central air conditioning in an old rental house, summers in southern California can be unpleasant, but who cared when I spent the day in an overly cool office?  Then came WFH.  I use these towels in combination with frozen Thermafreeze strips in the summer.  I cut strips 3/4 of the circumference of my neck and/or head, freeze them.  Then I dampen the towel, wrap the strip and wear the two around my neck or head, and if it's really hot, both.  The towels do not retain oil/sweat, wash easily, and are fairly durable.  These are a bit longer than other sports towels and will tie or wrap comfortably even for big guys (my son is 6'3"" and big).

2,SPORTS,Speedo Unisex-Adult Swim Goggles Hydrospex Classic,$13.27,5,"
  I lap swim 1-3x/week, 1000-2000yd each time. When I first started my swimming routine, I bought these goggles. I loved them- they fit well, didn't leak, and didn't fog too badly. However, with constant use, they got scratched up, and I decided to try something new just for the heck of it.I have been through Speedo Vanquisher goggles, two pairs of Kayenne goggles, and Cressi Flash goggles, and I have hated them all.-The Vanquishers fog quickly, are not easy to adjust, and the lenses are small.-The Kaynnes are nice in theory, but underwater, they make your vision super blurry (hence, the two pairs- I returned the first to see if it was a fluke, but both pairs did the same thing).-I found that the Cressi, which are super similar to the Kayennes, make vision somewhat blurry (but not as bad as the Kayenne) and leak a lot.Hence, I have a new pair of Hydrospex goggles sitting in my Amazon shopping cart, and I am about to purchase a new pair, because they truly have been the best goggles I've used so far.

  I've been using speedo goggles for years. I purchased my previous pair more than 10 years ago and they still work fine, but they are inner eye goggles that really dig in (they are the tinted googles shown in the photo). I got the hydrospecs to prevent the all-day raccoon eye I would otherwise have from those.They are awesome! Within ten minutes of taking them off, all marks are gone. They're really comfortable and I haven't had any problems with leaks after a month of wear. They also are AMAZING at preventing fog. My other pair fog up after just 1 lap, and these don't fog up in the slightest throughout an entire 40 minute workout. I don't have to rinse them at all in between laps. I am making an effort to rinse the chlorine off in the sink when I'm done, so hopefully the antifog will last as long as possible.The only con I've noticed is that occassionally big bubbles will get caught on the lenses and I have to shake my head to get them off so I can see again. I think this is just a consequence of not being as streamlined as the inner eye style.

  Best. Goggles. Ever!  My wife and I are triathletes, and swim 2,500-3,000 yards 2-5 times/week.  We have been using these goggles for several years - A plea to Speedo - PLEASE NEVER DISCONTINUE THESE GOGGLES!The biggest problem with OTHER goggles - leakage!  These goggles are soft all around the eye socket, and conform to most facial features, my wife, me and our 12 year old son all use them.  I swim in my contact lenses - never any leakage!The goggles generally last for about 12 months - we usually lose a pair before they wear out.I have given the Hydrospex goggles as gifts!Don't delay, buy a pair today!

  These are decent goggles at a low price point but do have some major flaws.I didn't expect too much based on the price point but was looking for some decent goggles for my 2x per week swim workouts.  Lesson learned: you get what you pay for.  They do fit fairly well and don't irritate my eyes; however, the anti-fog coating worked for about 2 weeks (4 swim sessions) and there is no retainer for the excess strap so it just flaps around in the water.  I've never had a pair fo goggles without some way to retain the strap.  The only option on these is to cut off the exces which is a hassle and prevents and adjustments down the road.These are okay for your kids playing around but not recommended for serious swimming or swim workouts.

  Junk...I bought these to wear in the shower after having Lasik surgery for the first week post surgery. Just after the first couple of uses, there is some sort of film on the lenses, making the view very foggy and distorted. Then one of the lenses started to crack and slowly expand into a larger crack. For being used in an environment as mild as a shower and for how short term I used them, I can't believe how bad these are. I'm sure they'd be even worse in a pool with chlorine and other chemicals. Maybe I got a lemon, but these are terrible. The only good thing was that they fit comfortably, but if the lenses are going to get a film on them and start to crack with extremely mild use, don't both wasting your money or time with them.

  See update at bottom... New pair broke immediately, see user photosOverall these are great goggles.  They are comfortable around my head and eyes, keep water out, everything.However, they don't last that long.  I swim 3-4 times a week in the summer, and I usually go through 2 pairs a season.  After time the plastic on the eyes will get foggy and scratched, the plastic around the eyes will warp, and the whole thing starts turning yellow.They are still the best goggles I found for recreational swimming, so get a pair, but if you swim a lot, expect them to wear out before the season is over.UPDATE: Bought a new pair, they broke after 2 uses, nose piece snapped in half, see photos.  Contacted company and was ignored.

  I gave up on using silicone adhesive bras and pasties because they were too visible under clothing, didn't stick on well enough, were too heavy and would fall off, or were see-through and didn't hide the nips properly. Then I found this tape, and decided to try it.It's the perfect color for a light to medium tan complexion, is totally invisible under a white burnout super thin tee shirt, and sticks very strongly even when weather is hot. It reminds me of kinesiotape.The adhesive did not bother my skin.Basically all my wardrobe problems are solved.

  Used the tape with a ‚Äúhigh thigh‚Äù bathing suit to hold in some skin at the hips (weight loss surgery issues) held on after being in the water for several hours, removal was easy and pain free. Also used the tape for its intended ‚Äúboob‚Äù purpose with a low cut dress (didn‚Äôt test it with water this time) held on really well and again removal was easy but then I realized.. I didn‚Äôt protect the nipples, which was dumb. Won‚Äôt be making that mistake again. I don‚Äôt have sensitive skin and didn‚Äôt get any irritation even with my questionable decision to tape over my nipples.

  I bought the vinyl dumbbells because they are cheaper that the neoprene kind. However, when I got them I was quite disappointed because the grip is very large. I have large hands for a woman, and my grip barely goes around the center. I wanted to return these, but I would have had to pay 50% in return shipping for what I bought them for, so I kept them. This was also frustrating to me, since the items were Amazon Prime. I will not be ordering vinyl AmazonBasics dumbbells again.

  BUYER BEWAREI purchased this set expecting to have two identical 10 lb weights. One weight was larger than the other even though both had ""10 lbs"" printed on the outside rubber material of the weights. Also, I weighed both weights I received separately and one was 2 lbs. lighter than (e.g. 8 lbs) then the expected ""10 lbs"" printed on the weight. Maybe they are low on stock and was hoping no one would notice as long as they printed ""10 lbs"" on the side and colored them the same. Buyers need to be aware.

  My husband suffered a stroke last July. He has been in rehab for many months and is now with me. Two pound weights were suggested by his PT and OT for strengthening his arm muscles on his left side, as well as helping his coordination. He is getting better day by day, although we still have a long road ahead. I would recommend these weights for anyone needing strengthening muscles in elderly individuals. I am also using them since I am his sole caregiver and am 65. He's 82 and progressing in his therapies.

  I've had this vacuum sealer for over a month now and I can say with confidence that its worth every penny. I refrained myself from reviewing products personally, but this product just had to be shared. I've been using this for multiple purposes from sealing processed food to packaging items. It has been a month+ since I've begun to use it and it seems to be holding up and working flawlessly. For the price of $53.49 to include a Lifetime Warranty is just a steal, of course within reason of it breaking. I'm a first time user myself so I was personally a bit uneasy to be working with such a new product. It comes with easy step by step instructions easy enough to read and understand for anyone. I hope this review was helpful for those who were seeking questions.

  Third one we've owned and by far my favorite. It just goes to show price point doesn't always equal quality. My last two were at least twice the cost. I can't speak to longevity, however I can definitely say that initial impression is excellent. Very easy to use and the fact that I can remove the top and wash the lower part makes cleanups a breeze. Anyone who's used this style vacuum sealer knows that the lower ""tray"" is what gets the dirtiest when marinating or sealing anything that contains even the slightest amount of liquid. If this holds up and proves durable, as I use it often for food storage and soux vide cooking.  I'd be happy to purchase another if needed. Also makes a great gift for busy people that need a quick meal. Recipes are endless and available online.

  After toying with the idea of buying a food vacuum sealer for years, I finally took the plunge and am so happy I chose this product. My plan was to use it primarily for storing bulk food long term, as my wife and I both love Costco meats but rarely eat enough steak/chicken/pork/salmon to make it worth buying the large quantities. I have used it so far to make vacuum sealed freezer ready portions of all of the above meats. The sealer was easy to use with intuitive buttons and set up, although the instruction manual does spell everything out as well. I also have used it to marinate our meat and holy cow, compared to regular ziplock bags, there is SO much more flavor with vac sealing for the marinade as it allows for constant contact of the flavors. Lastly, I like that the product comes in a nice box which I plan to keep it in when not in use and it fits nicely in one of our bottom cupboards. Overall, highly recommend.

  This machine performs as advertised. I have been a customer of the FoddSaver brand of vacuum sealer since they first came out.  I have had seven of them. My complaint is that last for a year and a half or two years, then they fail to create a vacuum.  I use these machines a lot as I buy in bulk, and sometimes package up 100 to 150 pounds of meat. I decided after last FoodSaver failed halfway through 60 pounds of pork, it would be my last one. I ordered this machine and it arrived on time as promised. It has done exactly as it was advertised. I am going to order an additional machine to take with me when I travel as I take advantage of sales, and need to seal and freeze as I buy.

  This is my first vacuum sealer purchase for myself, but I have plenty of experience using my moms Food Saver brand sealer. A newer, comparable product from the Food Saver brand (the space saving model) has five differences from this Entrige brand.1. This vacuum sealer only requires weight to close the top vs. a large switch that has the ‚Äúhand squeeze to close‚Äù button on the Food Saver brand.2. This vacuum sealer is 2 pounds lighter.3. While the length of this vacuum is about 2 inches longer, it is both shorter and less wide.4. This model has both a ‚Äúmoist‚Äù setting for non-dry foods, and a ‚Äúgentle setting for softer foods like breads and cakes that you don‚Äôt want smushed flat.  The Food Saver brand only has one setting.  (But honestly, who has cake sitting around long enough for the need to store it???  : ))5. The most obvious difference is the price tag. At just half the cost of the Food Saver brand it does just as much, if not more work!Highly recommend this product for anyone to try out!Pictured is the sealer and part of our garden haul this year, regular sized scissors for scale. : )

  My husband has been sealing all of our meat and it works great.  He even sealed all of the already frozen meat that we had in our freezer stored in ziplock bags. He had to experiment with it first because it was sucking all the juice out of the burger and prevented a good seal. He then read the instructions (ha ha) and it was advised to place a paper towel under the meat prior to sealing and it worked great after we gave it a try.  This is a great investment and I am happy that we chose this one. (I read so many reviews of others and I selected this one because of all the 5 stars, now I know why 5 stars, you get a 30 dollar gift card if you write a review).I did not know about the gift card prior to purchase and I definitely would give it 5 stars even without the gift card !!

  I first ordered a cheaper brand than this one and immediately regretted it and returned it and then tried this one. Because I came from a crappy one with crappy instructions this one feels like a miracle! Soooo easy to use and the instruction manual is very thorough and detailed and gives great suggestions and makes everything so easy to do! It also taught me something amazing...that cooked meat when vacuum sealed can last 10-15 days in the fridge!!! Ì†ΩÌ∏±Ì†ΩÌ∏±Ì†ΩÌ∏±. It came with this beautiful cloth and the suction tube for accessories and a small starter assortment of bags. It works fast and well and if something doesn‚Äôt hold its seal just read their manual and they‚Äôll tell you why! Most likely user error (fold in seam, food particles blocking seam etc). It‚Äôs also an attractive appliance so you can leave it on your counter for easy use. I bought it for long term food storage but after reading their manual I see that I will be using it daily for fridge items! Worth every penny. Don‚Äôt bother with cheaper ones from China, you get what you pay for.

  The scale works nice. I just did some calibration checks and the measurements look quite good. The lock function is quite usefull (mainly because I bought the scale to check the poundage of my bow) and it locks the measurement after 2s (but the scale needs to be steady). And, I thought the material of the scale strong. Just for completeness I attached 2 graphs showing its performance... in overall, it seems to have about 4% of discrepancy with the real weight.

  I love this hat. It fits like a traditional baseball cap. I hate when hats have that extra space at the top and make your head look extra long. This one doesn‚Äôt do that. The thing I love most is the Velcro strap. I have natural hair, super thick, curly, and susseptable to losing moisture. Because of this, it‚Äôs more susseptable to breakage and every time I wear a hat with a Velcro strap it gets caught in the Velcro and rips at my hair. Idk how to describe it but the strap on this doesn‚Äôt have regular Velcro. It doesn‚Äôt rip my hair! So awesome.

  This is a really doofy saggy hat. Apparently I might have a tiny head like beatlejuice, because this hate is gigantic on my head. I had to pull the strap all the way at the end but it wont hold because there is no more velcro there. cap is also too deep I can put my ears under it. If you have a huge head maybe this cap is for you. I measured my head and its 23 inches, 7/38 which is considered a large head in the size chart. So idk what else to say.......I am really having a hard time finding a decent fitting running cap : /

  I don‚Äôt know if this was mentioned in other comments but I hate how if you need to make the hat smaller using the adjustable strap, the excess strap just out stupidly because it‚Äôs on the outside of the hat.I have an averaged sized head and I needed to adjust the back by about 1/2‚Äù and having a 1/2‚Äù piece of adjustable strap jutting out from the hat looks really dumb. I loved the material of the hat and besides the back part it does look good. If you don‚Äôt need to adjust the size it‚Äôd be a fine hat.

  I have a big head. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. But it is what it is. That said, its not a huge head. According to Goorin's size measurement, I'm ""large"" not ""extra large."" Yet I have been endlessly disappointed by running hats. I've bought a bunch of wicking fabric running hats, from underarmor and other similar companies. Even at fully extended, they don't fit comfortably on my head. Too tight. If I loosen them any further, there's no more velcro to connect.Not so with this beauty of a hat. I'm wearing it right now, with the theading hook set at just about the midway point of the velcro. And there's plenty of room to go, in case my head gets any bigger! (not that I expect that to happen).Besides that, lets just talk about the quality of the build. Compared to the other hands, this thing is just a beast. Its stitched so well, its light, and its visually stylish.I'm a convert. Adidas hats forever. Well done Germany! Your companies make sportswear for real human beings with real heads.

"

  Fits fine when the velcro works. But yeah, haven't really owned any clothing that used velcro in awhile. Forgot how it, you know, loses its ability to stick to itself after awhile, kind of rendering it useless for running (maybe that's fine if you aren't moving around getting a bit of wind resistance, I don't know). I guess that's my bad for buying something with velcro that's near your hair, but then again, that's a terrible design decision so, menos puntos.Also doesn't really look great to be honest. Stains very easily and per adidas standard, the logo will peel off fairly quickly after washing (yes, you can wash ""cold"" to delay this a bit, but it's still going to come off).

  Amazing! Super easy to assemble,  and once you get in the groove, it's so easy! I just throw on a show and do it for the length of the show. Instructions say to do it for at least 30 minutes.  Of course, throughout you might have it slow down but just wiggle your hips again to get it going! *its is a little loud, since it's plastic but totally worth it.*

  I have received this for a week and played every day. It‚Äôs easy to assemble and adjust. At first I‚Äôm afraid the inside nobs will hurt. But actually they‚Äôre comfortable. The weighted ball goes very smooth along the track while burning the fat.  I‚Äôll recommend this to my friends.

  I provided pictures so all of you can see how much of a difference there is between the half gallon (black) and the gallon (aqua). They are both Giotto. These bottles come equipped with a sturdy lanyard which make the bottle stupendously easy to carry around. The bottle itself is freezer and dishwasher friendly. I would definetly suggest if you are trying to drink more water or just need a jug to take to the gym, zumba or running. Both the bottles arrived in time and I had no problems whatsoever with the seller or with shipping. Thank you Giotto

  It's as big as my baby lol I love it. I needed to stay on top of drinking water because Im breastfeeding and I wasn't getting in enough water. This bottle has been a life saver and I have been able to drink enough water and feel hydrated throughout the days. Its very well made and does not leak. I love the fun colors. I'm planning on getting one for my husband! I definitely recommend.

  First of all, a gallon water bottle is huge. I know a gallon is a lot of water-but dang. I posted a pic of it next to a regular athletic water bottle for perspective.I am updating my review because I have to say that the seller really worked with me to make this product right. I was initially very frustrated because the straw wasn't working (at all). Turns out that the straw with my bottle. However, the seller sent me a replacement and with the correct straw, this bottle is really great! I love the paracord handle, very durable and easy to carry (especially when I am carrying other things or bags). My kids love it as well. I definitely drink more water on the days I use this bottle.

  Purchased on 10/22. Rec'd 10/24.LOVE the purple color!! It is BIG, but it's a Gallon. I expected that. It's 14 Inches TALL. 17.5 Inches AROUND the bottle just below the top at the 7AM mark.I already carry another gallon jug so it is not too heavy for me. LOVE the coiled handle. Seems very strong and comfortable to carry. Does NOT scratch skin on fingers. Like the LOCKING lid. Very convenient. I wash it by hand, so don't use a dishwasher. The 2-piece STRAW - I'm really NOT SURE WHY it has 2 pieces. It came with BOTH pieces connected. The shorter piece lifts the straw to make it FLUSH with the top opening. The straw does NOT stick out once the lid is¬†opened. ¬†I have to grab it with my fingernails to lift it up JUST A BIT to drink from it.¬†-------------Love the sayings on the side. The times are 7 am, 9, 11, 1pm, 3,5, 7 & 9pm. I don't stay up that late cause I have to be up around 3-4 AM to get to work. SO I start drinking long BEFORE 7:00AM. Nonetheless, I can still tell IF I get the Gallon finished. I finish it in the first 2 days of having it. Third day, not so much. ¬†-----------------It is BIG, and does fit in my 2011 Altima's Console AFTER I remove the cup holder. SEE PICs. It basically fills the WHOLE area of the console. It will be hard to drink from it while I drive as the straw is TOO SHORT to lift OUT of the container.I'd have to use my 14 inch straw for that and even that only has about ¬†1 -1.2 inches above the rim, but I can drink from it. I cannot close the lid with my stainless steel straw in it, but I just leave it on my desk at work and drink. I don't carry it around!. That¬† would be too much trouble to try to drink from it while 'on the move', IMO.--------------------The TWO PIECE Straw IS strange. I'm NOT sure WHAT the purpose of that is.¬†Does anyone know WHY they make it in TWO pieces???.¬†The little short piece DOES NOT lift it high enough OUT of the top opening to drink from it so I don't know why it's made like this.-----------------I put Mint leaves in a tea bag or in ice cube tray & freeze and put them in the gallon to add some flavor to the water. Helps me drink it faster with a hint of Mint flavor. Lemon makes it taste bitter to me:).CON(s) - ONE that I've found, but I MAY have been the problem. Yesterday when I left work, water was at the 1 PM mark. I put the jug in my tote bag and put it in the car on the front passenger-side floor. While driving home (40mins), the bottle fell over and was lying on its side for that time. When I got home & lifted it up, the side of the tote was wet and some of the carpet on the car's floorboard. SO, I KNOW it leaked. I'm not sure if I was the one that caused it by NOT screwing the lid on tight enough when I got in the car OR if it really did leak on it's own.----------I may test this theory.BUT just know this jug SHOULD BE IN AN UPRIGHT position at all times :):)----------Do LOVE the PURPLE color.Will get another one!! as a backup to keep at home and may keep one in my desk at work. That way I won't have to transport it back & forth.Drink Up people!!!!!!=======================================UPDATE 11/1/2020 -The STRAW - I found another piece of the straw! SO, its a 3 PIECE STRAW!!!It is a TIP that WILL stick out of the top.(It was in the packaging bag & I overlooked it).SO, I updating my Review to include pictures of the tip that sticks up through the top to drink from.Nubian

  This water bottle is of good quality. I knew it would be huge before I bought it but I didn't really realize how huge. When full it weighs 8 lbs, as much as my largest child did at birth. Holding it feels like holding a well-swaddled newborn. There is little chance that you will actually be able to hold it in one hand unless you can palm a basketball. That being said, for someone who has a busy schedule at work and can't get away from my desk for a long time, I anticipate this will improve my ability to stay hydrated when I'm at work. However, if you really want to hold it in one hand probably go for the half gallon instead.

  So I have been wanting to drink more water, and measure my intake. I also thought the jugs with sayings are so cool! I found this jug, and instantly started getting compliments from my kids. So much so I ordered 3 more jugs within the first week! ****3 more**** So I got one for my daughter who loved it and wanted to then join the challenge with me, and one for the bf who only drinks water and is a ‚Äúworkout-aholic‚Äù, and third for my ex-husband bc that guy needs to drink anything besides alcohol. LOL These jugs are sturdy, and have been dropped accidentally, but my daughter‚Äôs did land just right so the hing on the drinking part broke, and easy to clean. The colors are awesome, and the bungee cord for carrying are amazing!!! I would definitely recommend one for everyone you know!!! We all love our jugs, and have tons of people asking about them!

  OK I like most people I struggle with drinking enough water as a medical assistant wearing a mask all day it‚Äôs even harder, but this really keeps you accountable. Not only does it give you motivation, but it also gives you a time limit in which to do it. The bottle itself is beautiful!!! iT doesn‚Äôt spill or leak has a straw that bounces up so it‚Äôs extremely easy to drink from.  I‚Äôve had to send links to several people wanting to purchase it for themselves. The para cord bracelet handle just makes it 10 times better!

2,SPORTS,SKIP BO Card Game,$7.99,3,"
  We LOVE Skip-Bo in our house.  It is really fun and easy, plus it is adaptable.  Almost any number of people can play.Why is it missing two stars?  Because this is the new version and the card appearances are confusing.  I don't know why they changed the back of the cards from the classic look, but the backs of the cards (which all say ""skip-bo"") look remarkably similar to the front of the ""skip-bo"" wild card.  If you look at the picture, you can see that the card under the ""12"" is the ""skip-bo"" wild card, and it looks too different from the numbered cards so it often gets confused for a card that has been accidentally turned over.  I would say this is a minor complaint, but EVERY SINGLE PERSON who has played with us has struggled with this aspect of the game.  A friend found a classic version of the game at a flea market and we all rejoiced because we could play without the skip-bo card confusion.  Like I said, a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.

  My husband and I are senior citizens.  I wish I could buy by the 6 pack as we go through these over time.  We play every other day and it's so much fun.  Of course, there i some random luck involved, but there is strategy in how you manage your piles and judging when to play and when to hold back.  I love that two people can play (not true with many games) and we travel with this and play in doctor's offices and in airports.

  This is an amazing addition to our game collection!  We have over 25 board and card games to supplement our homeschooling efforts.  This one was recommended by a friend whose kids love the game.  My son is 6 and this is an awesome way for him to practice numeracy!  I still help him a lot with the overall game, but he asks for this very often and its especially nice that a lost card or two will not really affect play.  I would recommend this very highly to any family, but especially to homeschooling families who use play as learning.

2,SPORTS,SKIP BO Card Game,$7.99,5,"
  I had to add more card to the set as my wife and I play with large stacks to get rid of.  Love this game.  I find it more fun with its just two of us playing as you can really stick it to the other person.  When the 11 year old plays my wife and her try to keep me from winning as I normally win as I am so cut throat.  They don't care about they're stacks as long as it messes with mine.  It's my favorite game of all the games we play.  Each game is different then the last.  The moment you flip a card from your stack it can either be good or bad so the anticipation is enjoyable.  Since you never know what the next card will bring you have to plan ahead and be prepared for anything.  Two 11's in a row... No problem I've got this.

  Extremely disappointed in this. It was not a full deck. There was only 123 out of 160 cards in the deck. Also cards were hand written and pulled from a mismatch decks (not just one either). I have been ripped off 20 for garbage which is where the deck ended up.

  Got this as a Christmas present. Not sure which game came first: SkipBo or Spite and Malice, but this is like a rip off Spite and Malice without quite as much fun. It is still pretty fun, and it is simpler to play than Spite and Malice, but I just kind of feel like there is something missing with this one. Do like the packaging...there is a cardboard tray inside the box that helps keep cards from slipping through the cracks. Why is ‚ÄúFor Traveling‚Äù a rating category on here??? Sure, it‚Äôs easy to take with you and play once you get to your destination, but it definitely couldn‚Äôt be played in the car.

2,SPORTS,SKIP BO Card Game,$7.99,5,"
  One of our favorite games. Easy enough for kids to learn, but challenging enough for adults. Although this looks like Uno, it is not. This game is more like solitaire in a group format. The only thing I would say is that initially we didn‚Äôt understand how to play the game. Once we watched a couple YouTube videos it was super easy. Since it‚Äôs a compact card game, it‚Äôs great game to take on trips. Won‚Äôt take up a lot of space in your cabinet like a board game. Plus for us since we have A LOT of games!!

  We purchased our original game at a garage sale for a quarter.  The cards were well used.  After a family camping trip where this game was often played, we decided on purchasing a new deck!  Everyone from our 6-year olds to adults loved the game.  Easy to learn, a bit heavy on the luck of the draw but still has a little strategy.  This is now in our ""go-to"" bag of family games.  Even a two player game is fun.  We added a house rule that the colors now matter on the build piles.  Makes it significantly harder and longer but it is a nice change of pace from the normal rules.

  After the first day of using the pliers I started seeing rust on the split ring. They barely saw any salt water and were washed and dried at home afterwards. After a few days more rust began appearing in small amounts among the pliers.

The pliers them selfs can cut bread and they have this bump on the tip, that makes it nearly effortless to pull even the deepest hooks.

  I was ready to immediately send them back if they were not able to cut my very fine 10lb test braid.  These pliers are incredible and did it without any problems.  Very light weight, holes in the grips to cut down on weight and I also use them to hold my hooks tighten up my knots.  The split ring separator works with larger split rings, but not very small ones.  I guess you can use your fingernail for that.  The length of the pliers are good and plenty to get down into the fish mouth to release the hook.  Over all these pliers are fantastic!

  These are very well-made, with excellent fit, finish, and quality.  I like how the faces and cutting edges on the pliers are removable/replaceable, and they come spring-loaded to stay open.  They come in a very nice gift box, and include a ripstop nylon holster for the pliers.  I'm a beginner fisherman buying his first kit, so I'm not sure what to make of the fish holder thing.  However, it is stoutly made and grips my finger enough to convince me that if you held a fish by the lip, the fish wouldn't fall or be able to pull out.  I didn't rate durability, as I've not used them yet.  After a few uses, I'll update this review as needed.

  First trip out and I used them to crimp close a weight which resulted in the tips stretching out and unable to grasp a hook so I tried to adjust them back and they broke.  With the ""auto open"" feature of the pliers they continuously slide out of the pouch due to how slick they are.  Pretty disappointed due to it being the first use with them.

  Let me preface by saying I'n in my upper 60's. When it came, I put it together in all of about 2 minutes. The knee pad is fine if you keep your knees together. If you put your knees hip width apart, you'll need another pad. No big deal. The pad is just something extra. The push up handles are great for me. When I do them on the floor, my wrists start to hurt quickly. These allow you to keep your wrist straight and you can vary the width and positioning easily to target different muscles and get a little more extension.Now for the roller. It rolls well on hard floors as well as thick carpet. The handles do slip some if you're not careful of your form. I did a few roll outs when I got it and waited until the next day to see if I was sore. Didn't feel much so I tried again the next day. Holy, swear words, Batman, core muscles were extremely sore. What was I thinking, trying this two days in a row? If I can get my stomach muscles back into shape like I want to, this thing will help me do it. I'm not ready yet for the resistance bands, but It's a keeper.

  I've been using ad wheels for about 18 years.  In 2018, I suffered a minor chest injury from lifting weights.  This minor injury made it painful to use ad wheels.  For nearly 2 years, I had not worked out with an ab wheel.  After 2 years I was ready to start using an ab wheel again but I lost a lot of core strength and could not effectively use any wheel.  So, I purchased this ad roller.  The elastic bands were just what I needed to give me the assistance to complete an effective workout.  After about 1 month of using the elastic bands and ad roller, my abs were strong enough to use the ad roller without the elastic bands.  I highly recommend this product for beginner and advanced users.

  Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Yes there were jokes about the certain stationary bike add and gifting a wife exercise equipment. Check back in a year for the diary compilation video.Very quick to assemble with no pinchy bits. The elastic trainer band is very helpful to get started with the wheel. Stick feet in the loops at one end and clip to the wheel handles. As you roll out, the elastic gives enough resistance to keep you from falling flat on your face if you roll too far. Which we all did when we first tried it without the bands.Push up handle bars, who knew. The foam pad around the handle isn't the greatest and I suspect will break down pretty quickly, but the push up experience is better with them.Knee pad won't get used. Workout room already has foam floor. If you have a hardwood floor, probably will be helpful.Summary: she liked the gift.

  These are classic, tried and true workout tools that have been around for a while. They are good to have in the workout room. They are simple yet effective. The push-up bars give a great extension for positive results that and the ab roller really works as it should. Both are great strength and muscle builders for shoulders, chest, arms, lats and abs.

  Was looking for an ab roller and saw this one that came with push up bars and went with it. Roller works as expected though I find that it's a little hard on the hands if you're not wearing padded gloves. Pad is fine and the bands are a nice touch, though I don't use them.Oddly enough, I'm most happy with the push up bars. Now that I'm working out from home due to COVID with minimal equipment, I use the push up bars often. The added range of motion makes the workout a little better and also the neutral hand position is key for me since I have carpal tunnel. The set was a nice addition for my home workouts. So glad I acquired enough home equipment over the years to get decent workouts at home now that gym's are closed.

  This review is for the KEVENZ 50-Pack KEVENZ 3-Star 40mm White Table Tennis Balls,Advanced tournament Ping Pong Balls (Tournament ping-pong Ball).I started off not looking to buy 50 but when you look at the price compared to buying a smaller number it just made more sense.  The balls bounce true and work as expected.  All 50 balls came shipped in a box that is now doubling at the storage bin.  None were damaged on arrival.  We keep it the storage bin next to the ping pong table and when a ball goes flying out of play or gets lost the kids just reach and grab a new one.  Once a week or so I go and pick up all the ""lost"" ones and put them back in the storage bin.  .I'm the type who does a lot of review and comparison before making a purchase.If you found my review helpful please like it.

  Have a slightly tackier feel to them than the more expensive big brand balls. The weight and size is on par...the balls bounce well. So if you are OK with the tackier feel (better spin because of grip, if you ask me) than that of the smoother balls, get these. What a great deal. 5/5

  You can never have too many ping pong balls. And if you play table tennis with kids, you can double that advice. These are solid balls that bounce and spin well. They have a crisp feel off the paddle, and ping smartly off of the table. They also stand up to wicked spikes and hard forehand slams.I‚Äôm an amateur player, and I like these balls. At .20 cents each, they are a decent value for a 40mm ball. You can keep the game moving without having to constantly retrieve balls. For 10 bucks, it‚Äôs a good buy for 50 balls.

  This is a good pack of balls..  Round, orange, smooth, bouncy, and consistent.  I don't have much to compare it to and I'm just a novice player but they work fine for me and the guys at work.  We lose a lot of balls so a 50 pack was perfect.

  What a great price for these balls.  Around $.20 a piece, which is probably 5-10 times cheaper than buying a pack of 3 at a random store.  The balls themselves are a good color orange, are spherically symmetrical (you'd think that should be a given, but those cheaper balls are not very spherical, especially 1-star balls), and are a good hardness to give some weight to your games.  After several games of smashing the balls you might crack them, but they last a long time.  Will buy these again if I ever end up breaking them all.

  ¬†I have bought several of these cameras and I will give you the pro's and cons.  Con's first if you buy one expect to return it until you get one that works properly.  Yup took four times to get an actual working camera.  First two put batteries in made a squealing noise and wouldn't work...returned for a replacement twice the second time they would not send me another just refunded my money...Ok ordered one from another vendor.  That one tested good put it out in the field and it went through a set of batteries in the first night.  Returned and got my latest one...so far so good.  I have high end cameras also but for the price point this one when it works does a pretty good job.  Video is stellar, sound is almost non existent unless the animal is right next to the camera.  I like the wide angle too.  I have one in the field that is still going strong after a year of daily use. So if you are looking for a cheaper trail camera this will suit you. I have attached a video for ya of my resident bobcat.  Hope this helps

  My unit clicks like it is rapidly snapping pictures while in the setup mode and there is nothing in the manual about this happening.  I have asked Campark two times what is going on with this and do I have a bad unit.Absolutely no reply.  There was a letter in the box crying the blues about their business needing positive revues on Amazon, but they are not living up to their obligations.

  I wanted a trail cam and wanted to spend under $100. Research and reading reviews led me to purchase the CamPark T45A. So far it has not disappointed. Everything works as intended and the videos and photos are quite clear and good looking even in the les HD settings. The controls are pretty easy to use and the manual easy enough to understand. I love the LCD screen built in for viewing what you have captured on the spot. ANY complaints would be that I wish the sensors were a little more sensitive at distances beyond 10'  and page 15 of the instruction manual was printed blurry.

  I bought this camera to find out what critter keeps digging holes behind my bushes and digging up my mulch. I also wanted to check out what other critters might be lurking in the night. The only issue I had was in reading the instruction booklet. The writing is very small. The diagram uses numbers to point to the camera features, but the numbers a white inside a tiny tiny black dot. I literally had to use a magnifying glass to see the numbers. If the instruction booklet would have had a bigger font, I would have given my overall rating a 5 instead of a 4.

I‚Äôm definitely not thin but also not all that big, so I bought an XL to be safe and it fit great!! It is definitely snug as advertised but not unflattering or uncomfortable, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in a sausage casing. I was worried it would be too short but was again pleasantly surprised; the shirt hit right at my waist which is what I wanted. If you‚Äôre wearing this casually you won‚Äôt have to worry about it rolling up, but if you‚Äôre exercising I can see it rolling a bit depending on what you‚Äôre doing and what your body type is.

I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 155-160lbs, usually wear a small or medium top, and wear a 34C - I got the medium and it fits perfectly and makes the girls look amazing!

The size is perfect to me , easy to fold up and spreading, doesn't accupied much space. Good quality!

  The foot holds are so poorly designed and equally poorly placed, they are non-functional.  The foot holds are far too small for a person of average size and weight to use.  They are also fixed so close to the bench's structural beams, there is no useful or practical way to anchor one's feet while exercising. I am very disappointed and would appreciate a replacement bench which is more satisfactorily designed and crafted.UPDATE:  Flybird customer service representative, ""Dena,"" was exceptionally accommodating and responsive.Dena considered my initial feedback regarding the poorly designed and equally poorly placed foot holds on the original bench the company sent.Within a couple days, Dena shipped me a replacement bench which was considerably sturdier and noticeably better designed than the original.I was dually impressed by the level of customer service Dena provided and am satisfied with the replacement bench Flybird provided at no additional cost.

  This workout bench is not bad at all for its price and capabilities. It can incline and decline to the most comfortable angle that you will like. I need an adjustable bench, but there wasn't a single space, I just put it in my bedroom, and this fit perfectly. It's strong. It is safe and not to shake during exercise. The cushion is long and comfortable which is enough me. The leg holder bar is reliable when I use this bench for sit-ups, it can be removed. The bench has a plastic cover on its leg so that no matter how I moved it, it wouldn't scratch my floor. This is great. I use it every day to exercise. I am satisfied with my purchase.

  I read the reviews before I bought this bike. The reviews are accurate. The instructions are confusing. The tension levels could be stronger. Seat is uncomfortable. It's a good price for a starter bike. It gets my heart rate up.In the instructions there are three different sized bolts. Two are the same size in the pictures of the instructions. Instructions say to get a ruler out to measure the bolts. Why can't they show small, medium, and large bolts in the instructions? Not hard for them to show three actual sizes in the book. The drawinJust like other reviewers I ended up tossing the instructions to the side and figuring it out on my own.Someone else mentioned the tension levels could be better. I agree. Level 8, the last level, is about how it feels riding a street bike on level pavement.Yes the seat is uncomfortable. Bike seats just are. But in time I should get used to it. If you want a comfortable seat get a recumbent bike.This bike is a great price for what it is. This is my first stationary bike and was not willing to spend too much on my first one. It does get my heart rate up where I wanted it using levels 6 through 8. I know I will eventually out grow this bike and want more in a bike but for the price it is a great starter bike.

  I ordered the mid range model for the timer and speedometer/odometer‚Ä¶ None of which work properly. The timer has a gain of at least two seconds per minute and the speedometer/odometer are incredibly generous (currently telling me I‚Äôm riding over 20 miles an hour). Within the first day the belt jumped and I had to disassemble the entire bike and figure out how to rethread the belt. All in all the bike has been disassembled/reassembled twice so far (once by my mechanic)....there is currently quite a noise coming from the front belt tension spring - meaning I will be taking this apart again. I would not recommend this for anyone needing to keep up with marathon, cycling or triathlon training - though if affordability is your key necessity BUY this bike. I would heartily recommend this bike to the average person who does not need accurate measurements.

The cardboard with all the hardware marked says there's supposed to be 4. That 4 is scribbled out and a 2 was written in, and just two of them are there. What even is going on here?!UPDATE:Turns out all the parts were in fact included. I only figured this out after a trip to the hardware store when the bolts I picked up were to short. There was included bolts that did fit, they were mislabeled in the instructions as well as the packaging.Bike is pretty good so far now.

  I assembled this product by myself despite the instructions suggesting two people tackle it. I kept the original box and used it to prop up some parts of the bike during assembly which was not overly difficult even by myself. I'm 71"" tall and have a 32"" inseam; and even with the seat-post extended to its maximum safe length, there is a noticeable bend in my knee when the pedal is in the lowest part of its revolution. While I do not find this to be particularly undesirable, I prefer a more extended reach with my legs while exercising. The best part of this machine is the magnetic resistance feature which isn't overly difficult even on the highest setting, yet still provides consistent and smooth resistance. The machine does not require electrical power to operate (except for the monitor which requires batteries), and the magnetic resistance mechanism when in operation is nearly silent. The bike itself does not take up much floor space and can be used even if tucked into a corner of a room. I bought this exercise machine to replace an older elliptical-trainer which required electrical power, took up twice as much space and was loud while in operation. Overall, I really like the function and performance of this exercise bike. Well worth the money when purchased by those with appropriate height and leg-length.

  The rest of the bike is fine, but the seat is EXCRUCIATING. It's like sitting on a metal pole, so I physically could not endure using the bike for more than 30 seconds as it came. Actually, a metal pole may have been more comfortable. I bought a padded gel seat cover, which made it tolerable, though it's still uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. If I want to continue to use it, I think I need to invest in a whole new seat.

  Well, im as skeeptical as they come; i bought these gloves due to my very painful arthrtis in my hands that often keeps me awake nights. I have read about compression and copper and how there is no scientific proof as to its pain relieving qualities; however I had become desperate for relief. When I received them I put them on that very evening while watching TV. As the night went on my hands felt betterbut I didnt give the gloves nuch credence. I have now been wearing them each night for the last week and am convinced they have made a difference in my level of pain and discomfort. I dont understand how they work or if its just psychological but I'll take it! I would have given 5 stars but its only been a week. If it continues toelp I will come back and update.Make sure if you order these that you get the proper size and measure your hands as they instruct. If you guess you could get the wrong size and lose any benefit you would otherwise receive. Its critical to the success of the gloves. Thanks and good luck to you!

  I bought these gloves in hope that they would help with my arthritis. I have been wearing them for a couple weeks now and I am sad to say the have a rip in the seem between the wrist and the thumb. I am hoping the Copper Compression Company sees this and can help me replace them.Other than the seam rip the gloves are very comfortable and are the perfect fit.UPDATEI received an email right from one of the company owners. He was very apologetic and took care of the problem right away.I recommend these gloves as I have been wearing them for almost two months and I feel a difference for sure.Great customer service!

  I‚Äôm 30 and have fibro, and lately have been waking up with stiff, swollen and painful hands. I also have Raynauds Symdrome and its winter so that may play into this issue as well.. the gloves, when worn to bed, actually do prevent much of the pain the next morning. I was very surprised. These are also very comfortable, I got a different pair as a gift and those ones have a seam on the thumb that literally rubbed my thumb joint raw in one night! Took days to heal and I never wore those gloves again. These ones rock! Comfort, compression (gentle)  and ride of pain.ill take it!

  I received these gloves December 15, 2018 and could see that the quality was poor. The stitching on the middle finger of the left hand glove was coming unraveled. I sent an email to Copper Compression with a picture of the defect three days ago. I've had no response from Cooper Compression. Not Good!

  Very compressed and snug.  Drove all over looking around stores for something and found something even better with these gloves.  Hand feels virtually pain free as long as gloves are worn.  Broke right hand months back and these gloves makes post surgery recovery sooner.  Im already out playing basketball and I play with these gloves on.  I feel instant comfort as soon as gloves go on. Use chart to measure. Size is specific and I go from size M-L with these gloves.  I measure L and they fit perfect.  I was curious so I ordered a size M and they fit smaller and more snug and compressed without any discomfort.  I wear the size M when I play Basketball or any other sport for the more compressed feel.  However it does feel tight around the fingers with the M size.  So size L is perfect size for me.  Again, these gloves are size specific, measure carefully..

  Bought these gloves because I'm a pianist who performs 3 hours a night, 6 nights a week.  And lately had some torn ligaments.... ive worn these 24/7 For the last month.  I wash my hands like normal,  shower in them, ect...  I'm 31 years old and was extremely skeptical... But to my surprise,  the pain in my hands during performances was eliminated... honestly I'm afraid to take them off.  20 bucks is less than a dollar a day... So they're a good value.... ive literally changed the wheel bearings on my motorcycle,  worked on 2 friends cars,  changed the oil in my truck and various other stuff over the last month and they've held up well...  It's time for another pair,  as now i can see the copper had started to dissipate in the knuckles,  and there's a small tear pictured....

  I've been using these gloves for a while now and they really seem to help with the pain and swelling. I've got arthritis in my right hand and had a major flare up back in May. Nothing really seemed to help with the swelling until I got these gloves. It's taken a while, but most of the swelling has finally gone down. I really like to use these gloves while I drive long distance and am on the computer. My hand gets very achy during these times. If I wear the gloves while I'm doing either of these tasks, I notice that my hand doesn't ache very much by the end of the day. I just ordered a couple of more pairs so that I can always keep one at my desk and one in my car. I'm still using the other 2 pairs that I bought months ago so they're are holding up nicely. In my opinion, the quality of these gloves is very good.

  First let me say I have very bad wrist pains, arthritis. I was issued wrist braces from my Dr. and they are good at immobilizing my wrist, but dang near impossible to type correctly in.  These compression glove have helped with both of my concerns. I am able to type better with the gloves and they are great for pain relief.  Keep in mind these are compression gloves so they should not be loose, use care when putting on and off. I have been using them for about two + weeks. I use them the entire time at work and at home when my wrist begin to hurt, and I do get relief. I also sleep with them on from time to time and my wrist feel good in the morning. Now if your fashion savvy, well I do look like a dork walking around in business work / casuals work cloths with black gloves with fingers exposed.One co-worker referred to me as Chuckie from Sons of Anarchy....they guy with only index and thumbs...ok I digress..Great glove, works, CustomerCare is top notch, definitely give them a chance to fix any issues you may run across, only fair since they pride themselves on quality, care and customer satisfaction. Would I recommend yes highly.Hope this helps this helps some of you out there.From E

  I am a male golfer in my 60's, generally hitting 210-220 off the tee, and shooting in the mid 80's. I like to hit orange balls, which I can track in the sky and find on the ground easiest. Before these balls, I went back and forth between the previous generation Supersoft and orange Titleist Velocity balls.I liked the Titleist better off the tee, and would usually get about 10 yards more. But I liked the Supersofts everywhere else, as they seemed to come off my irons with more energy, and were friendlier on and around the greens. I tended to use the Titleists on long courses, and the Supersofts on shorter tracks.The new 2021 Supersofts have changed things completely. They are every bit the equal of the Titleist Velocity off the tee now, and I have had to club down with my irons. These things seem to explode off my irons - I haven't hit a ball this far with my irons since before my shoulders wore out. For reference, my average 7 iron hit increased from 135 yards to about 145. The new Supersofts fly just as straight as the previous model. They seem a bit softer on the green though, and I find myself having to putt a little harder to get the same roll.The ball seems just a little shinier than the previous generation - maybe a tiny bit less of a matte finish. The dimples seem more pronounced and deeper, though that might just be a side effect of different finish. The surface feel is slightly different too. It's hard to describe exactly - maybe slightly soapy? It isn't unpleasant - not tacky or slimy - just a little different than before.I couldn't be more pleased with the new Supersofts. No more choosing between the Callaways and Titleists for me - this round goes to the Supersoft.

  I wanted to try narrowing down my choice of golf balls. I decided to give these a try. Off the tee they certainly have a zing to them. They carry well and offer great feedback. Balls like the high end 3 and 4 piece balls just have that woody feel to them that I'm not into. These feel great and really fly and give you some distance. They won't correct your curve to your swing or make you hit like a pro. They offer great roll after your carry in the air. However, that roll is where they struggle on your approach shots. It's a bit of a struggle in that regard, isn't it? You need the distance to make the green but then the ball just wants to keep that momentum. You'll reach the green but the ball likes to keep rolling. I have had a hard time getting them to stop. So, I usually switch balls for my approach shots to a higher compression ball with more spin.Good balls, not great. Well worth the price though. You won't spend 30 minutes searching for one if it goes far off line.

  The golfball itself in my opinion is very good.  It comes off the club extremely soft and takes off like a bullet.  I have bought the Matte Green, the Matte Orange , the Matte Red, and the Yellow.  I am very satisfied with the over all quality of them.  The only one I really don't care for are the RED ones.  Don't get me wrong, they are still great balls, but the only issue I have with them is the fact they are extremely hard to follow.  Once it leaves the club and you lift your head to follow it, it's difficult to pick it up In the air and see where it is going and where it lands.  Unless you're playing with a partner or in a group, you may lose more of these compared to the other BRIGHTER colors due to not seeing where it is going.  Even the ORANGE are a little difficult to follow some times, but not nearly as bad as the RED.  Take my advice and go with the MATTE GREEN, definitely the best choice all around.  I am returning the 3 dozen RED boxes and want to exchange them for the GREEN.  But not all is lost with the RED ones, they can still be used if you only want to use them for chipping practice in the yard or around practice greens.  Hope this helps others when it comes time to buy them.

  Picked these up to replace my dwindling supply of Titleist DT trusoft and I must say they play very similarly.  Nice soft touch around the green and good feel off irons/woods.  I consider myself an improving hacker so I don't feel I get the benefit of a premium ball, for my these worked very nicely and gave me the feel on the short game that I look for.  I'll probably keep gaming them in the future.

  Well I got these because they are red and I'm hoping to easily be able to find when golfing, as I have never actually played a 9-hole yet. Only reason I'm giving these a four-star is because they are red (ish) lol because of the matted finish they're kind of like a pinkish red color. I was just sort of hoping for a solid red to dark red. But other than that I look forward to using them

  My go to golf balls. These are Perfect for me. The bright orange color really helps make them visible on the course. Plus most people hit a white golf ball so the likelihood of someone mistaking your ball for theirs is pretty much nonexistent.

  I cannot review the actual product, though I would like to praise the company. Last week I‚Äôd ordered one punching bag as a birthday gift for my great-nephew, but due to co-vid19 the grandparents are unable (as of yet) to get the gift to him. However, just today I received an email from the company stating that due to the pandemic  whoobli wants to give a little joy to children who are being cooped up. They asked me to choose a child of my choice for them to send a free punching bag to, so that the child can have a little indoor fun. It wasn‚Äôt a contest. It wasn‚Äôt a BOGO or a sales ploy. It was an after the fact, good from the heart gesture from a company I will be sure to deal frequently with again.

  Ours boys (2yo and 4yo) have recently been watching the 1990s cult classic Three Ninjas. We needed to find a way to help them release their energy after watching the movie, so my sister purchased this punching bag. The boys absolutely loved it and were playing with it non-stop after it came in. The product seemed super durable, including the gloves that came with it, so we were really excited about them being able to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, we believe we received a defective product because the bag popped off the top after two days of use. I contacted the seller about replacement and was immediately contacted back. They were willing to replace it and then some for our inconvenience. They setup another order to be shipped the same day I contacted them and told me not to worry about sending back the defective product to lessen any further inconvenience to me. I've never received such great customer service from a company and was overwhelmed by their generosity! We will continue to buy products from them in the future due to their top notch customer service and their fun products!

  I bought this for my grandsons birthday. Since he lives over a 1000 miles away I've never seen it. A few days after I bought it,the company sent an email saying since the nation is going through such a hard time they'd like to reach out and do something to help and offered another punching bag to any child I'd like to send it to. This ACTUALLY brought me to tears. It was the first kind words I'd heard in many months.  I had it sent to my other grandson- his brother. My daughter says they do use them,I ask. One bag doesn't stay inflated. Dont know what she means because I've never seen them.she says it's not a problem, they reinflate it. And then they dont fight for turns. This company is special.  I wanted something to keep my kids active while being stuck inside. To burn off some energy so they dont make my daughter crazy who is working from home. Sounds like this helps alot !

  Pros+ Very durable for the price, we had bought a similar product which was around the same price and that one broke almost instantly. This product is still going strong.+ When you fill the base with water it is very stable, I was concerned it would topple over.+ My kids love it, they literally fight over who gets to have a go.+ The boxing gloves are awesome!Cons- You have to set it up. It is pretty easy to set up but I would have loved something you can just pull out of the box and it‚Äôs good to go.- The plug was difficult to put into the stand.Overall very happy with my purchase.

  Updated review:Whoobli was fantastic! They noted my review and reached out to me to make this right.  They sent me a new item express shipping and followed up to make sure it worked.  The bag is fantastic and just the right sized for my seven year old. It doesn't tip over but is not so heavy that I can't move it out of the way.  I highly recommend this bag and Whoobli!  Thank you for the wonderful and professional customer service.I was really disappointed at the quality of the actual bag. No matter how much I pumped, it wouldn't inflate.  I finally looked at the inflation tube and, lo and behold, it wasn't actually attached.  It was leaking everywhere.

  It's a great set! Easy to assemble within 10 minutes, all the parts were there, and ready to use quickly. It's tough enough for my 7 year old to punch hard. We used water in the base and haven't had an issue with it falling over. You could add sand if needed. This was purchased as a gift for our 7 year old son who loves to pretend fight everything in the living room thanks to the Avengers. We are hoping to give the pillows and couch a break. He was excited to get his own ""punching gloves, "" but switches between them and hulk fists. I do not recommend punching without gloves at first. If they accidentally punch low, the base of the bag is metal and doesn't feel great on the knuckles.

  Our 8 year old son plays travel ball and always likes to wear eye black.  This is the second one I've purchased.  It goes on nice and thick, comes off easily with makeup remover (I use micellar water).  The only thing you have to be careful of is if it's hot outside.  We live in Georgia and it gets very hot down here.  I had it in my purse and it melted, luckily I had it in a plastic bag.  Overall, you can't beat it for the price.

  I first bought this product as a single roll at a nation wide popular drug store and I was very impressed with it all around. I then thought that I could save some money by buying the white medical tape, also at that same national chain, but I found out that the white stuff doesn't adhere anywhere nearly as good as this tan waterproof tape. So I decided to buy more of the tan water proof tape, but I found out that if I buy a 6 pack of it on amazon, the price per roll was much cheaper than what it cost for a single roll at the brick and mortar national location. So I bought at amazon. The first thing that I noticed after I opened my amazon package was that the 6 pack of tape came in clear plastic shrink wrap without any disposable identification that this was a Nexcare prouct, but I did see on the inside cardboard roll that the tape is wrapped around does have the same logo as what I bought at the national chain pharmacy. However, what I noticed was that it didn't seem to stick quite as well and it actually seems like the 6 pack tape is actually thinner than what's sold at the national chain store. When I wrap the 6 pack tape more tightly it does stick though. But I was wondering if this was a knock off or whether Nexcare was selling this tape on amazon with slightly less dense material. All in all though it does seem to hold up, but if I was going on vacation and going to need tape that may get wet (currently I'm not using it to go into water), like in a pool or ocean, I would probably want to bring at least one roll of the other stuff just to be sure.

  Don't mind my hair or tired look, I am a nurse and have been working on a COVID unit since the pandemic started. For over a year of wearing masks for 12+ hours I began building calluses and pressure injuries around my face, mainly nose bridge and cheek bones. It's gotten to the point where I've had incurable acne on these areas no matter what I did.I started wearing bandaids on my face but they would slide off and I needed to exchange them frequently. So I sought to find something that would protect my face and stay in place for 12+ hours and I came across this beauty.This picture was taken in the driveway of my home after a 12 hour shift. These definitely stay in place regardless and sweat and tears. Excuse my attire, I change outside my car after every shift and take off my surgical cap, which explains the messy hair. But this goes to show this adhesive foam tape works wonders!My face is clearing up and my acne is finally calming down. It's not gone, but it's definitely improved thanks to this tape.

  This was the least expensive product that I purchased to cover a recent surgical scar, yet proved to be the best. The other kinds I bought that said they were waterproof etc, in fact were not. This tape stays secure most of the day, preventing the sun from discoloring the scar. It works well while in water, but not all day. For a day at the beach I replace it maybe 2 times. Not a huge inconvenience as it stays on in the water. I would definitely recommend. Also great for blisters/ shoe rubbing

  I am beyond happy with this product.  I have a Treager grill and had been trying my hand at cold-smoking cheeses using their method, which is a pan of cheese in a pan of ice in the grill on the smoke settings.  It was a major pain to try to keep the temperature anywhere close to right.  I bought this smoker tube and and made a temporary modification to the grill to defeat the hot rod and the auger and just use the fan.  Found out that the Treager will shut the fan of if the temperature is below a preset temperature for over 10 minutes.  Again, a headache trying to keep is going for several hours.  I finally backed off the over-thinking and simply put the smoking tub on the drip pan close to the opening where the grease drains.  There was plenty of air available to keep the pellets smoking.  The ambient temperature of the smoke was relatively constant and in the 87 to 95 degree range.  When the temperature got over 90, I simply put a 4 x 8-inch baking dish on the grate directly over the tube and threw a handful of ice cubes in it.  The temperature was back to 90.  I filled the tube with pellets and it is still going after three hours.  Forget Treager's advice on how to cold smoke cheese;  put this tube in the grill and the job is done.

  The UPS guy showed up about 3pm and I ran to the freezer, grabbed a sirloin and some haddock fillets.  It was a rush job, thawed the steak in the waver, thawed the fillets in warm water as they were shrink wrapped.  I had my wood pellets purchased from last year. I filled the tube, tried to light it on the stove indoors.  BAD IDEA!  Filled the kitchen full of smoke, ran outdoors placed it in the grill and it went out.  Tried to light it with a cigarette lighter, no luck. Went back and read the instructions and found a propane torch quickly got it up and smoking, just like they suggested.Back inside, I seasoned the sirloin with some Montreal seasoning from Samsclub.  Poked the steak with a fork a few hundred times both sides to tenderize.  Seasoned the haddock with Tuscan garlic seasoning from Samsclub.  Ran outdoors placed all meats on the upper racks for smoking for about and 1 1/2 hrs.  Remember, I am a guy, nothing fancy.  Cooked up some instant turkey stuffing, hungry Jack mashed potatoes and a 15 year old bag of frozen peas.  Cooked the 1"" thick steak about 7-8 minutes each side on the lower rack.  It came out med rare and with perfect grill  scorching on the surface.Some of the  best tasting food we had had in years.  The Haddock should have been cooked less time, but aside from that, the taste was excellent.

  I can't believe people are using propane torches to light these smoke tubes.There's an old saying ""you only need to be 10% smarter than the equipment you're working with"" and to me wasting time standing over a pellet tube with a propane torch in hand trying to light them is simply a ridiculous waste of time not to mention expensive.Like I said you only need to be 10% smarter than equipment you're working with, that's why I use a shot glass and 91% alcohol to light my pellets.  it's far cheaper and much safer.  Once again you only need to be 10% smarter than the equipment you're working with so please ( don't light  the pellets on fire in the shot glass)91% alcohol burns very hot and very clean which means unlike lighter fluid it leaves absolutely no residue and imparts absolutely no flavor.I simply take an old shot glass, fill it with pellets then pour just enough 91% alcohol to cover the pellets. I let them soak for about 5 minutes while I prep the BBQ. Unlike water alcohol will not cause the pellets to swell.When I'm ready to light the tube  I simply pour off the excess alcohol, drop the alcohol soaked pellets on top of the pellets in the Smoke tube and light them. in less than a few minutes your smoke tube will be billowing clouds of smoke.Be forewarned don't Let the pellets in the Smoke tube flame too long  as you will ignite too many pellets and it will generate billowing clouds of very dense smoke and burn your pellets up much faster.Although I will say that being able to generate dense clouds of smoke comes in handy sometimes, for example if I want to cold smoke a steak before grilling it,When cold smoking a steak I'll let half the tube catch on fire blow it out and put it in the smoker. Then I Fire the pellet grill up for just one cycle, when it hits a hundred and fifty degrees I unplug it so it doesn't go through the fan cool down period, this allows the pellet in the burner to slowly burned down. If the temperature in the smoker drops below 90 degrees I'll plug it in for another cycle,I let the steaks smoke over Mesquite until the internal temperature of the steak reaches 100 degrees at which point I pull it and post sear it on a Weber with lump charcoal to the final temperature. If you like extremely strong smoke you can let the steak cold smoke until it reaches 120 internal. Pull it off the barbecue and let it rest until it drops back to 100 internal and then post sear it.If I'm using the tube for say ribs or pulled pork then I only let a small fraction of the pellets catch fire before blowing them out. Using this method the tube will run for about 5 hours.By the way It takes less than a half an ounce of 91% alcohol to light the smoke tube meaning that a $2.50 quart bottle of 91% alcohol is enough to light your smoke tube 64 times making it far less expensive than using those ridiculously expensive disposable propane cylinders.The bottom line is this is an excellent product for any BBQ. I find it almost indispensable in my electric cooker for smoking fish.If you're interested I'll give you a little background in my barbecue endeavors along with some tips that I picked up over the years.My wife and I have been involved in competitive BBQ. Since the 1970s prior to an injury that disabled me, my lovely wife and I traveled the country in motorhomes towing whatever BBQ we could afford to Bbq competitions. As time went on and we started winning more and more Awards picking up sponsors along the way we were able to upgrade to a custom-built 40 foot Class A Diesel Pusher towing a custom-built Klaus BBQ pit.Over the years we've developed several award-winning recipes and even though we are now retired from the barbecue circuit we still like to barbecue, but on a much smaller scale.After 50 Years of cooking on large stick burners I never thought I would ever even consider a pellet smoker.I've cooked on everything from a klaus custom built BBQ Pit, off the shelf Gator BBQ Pits... Green eggs, Weber Smokey Mountains and Ugly Drum smokers, heck one of my favorite BBQs was an old dryer drum..... and now  I can add pellet grills to that list and I have to say I think at this point next to a stick burner they are my favorite.We have 2 horse ranches one in California and one in Montana and unfortunately that means we simply don't have the time anymore to sit around babysitting a stick burner for 12 to 14 hours. But we still love our barbecue so we decided to give pellet grills a shot, at first I wasn't overly impressed with them. they take quite a bit of adjustment to technique to make them work right. But with the proper technique they can produce BBQ that's  just as good as the best competition stick burner.With that said this is probably one of the best accessories I have found for your pellet grill. It is easy to use and allows you much more precise control over how much smoke is being generated by your barbecue.One of the biggest newbie mistakes to barbecue we see is food coming out of the barbecue tasting like it was left in a smoldering forest fire. I hate over smoked food, smoke is like any other seasoning it should accent the flavor of the food not be the flavor of the food.That's where this tube really shines it allows you to very precisely control the amount of smoke being generated in your barbecue. It also allows you to cook using generic cooking pellets while saving your good flavor pellets for the smoke tube..Generic competition blend pellets produce a very mild smoke, you can add Mesquite to your pellet tube to bump it up a notch or if you really want strong Mesquite flavor fill the hopper with Mesquite and a tube with Mesquite but you need to be careful again not to over smoke the food.It also allows you to mix and match wood flavors, for example Apple in the hopper and Cherry in the Smoke tube.I find the pellet tube works best with Alderwood and an electric smoker for smoking fish.I find that stick burners, pellet grills, charcoal grills all have a tendency of massively over smoking fish. So I have a small electric smoker that's dedicated to doing nothing but fish and I must say This smoke tube works amazingly well in the electric smoker for fish..The bottom line is you're probably going to want to buy two of these.

  Nice Product.  A full tube lasts me about 4.5-5 hours with quality pellets, less with cheaper Walmart variety.  Adds a good level of additional smoke.  I fill it with pellets and let it overhang about 5 inches off the prep shelf on the side of my grill.  Hit it with the propane torch for 15 seconds or so until a flame appears.  Let the flame burn out or blow out after a couple of minutes.  Then put the tube in the grill.  The end on the self doesnt get hot so it is easy to pick up.I have recommended to friends and would buy again.

  I have a pellet smoker and it's easy to use but it's lackinf in flavor compared to how I used to do it using charcoal and wood so I've been searching for a solution to keep the ease of use I get with the pellet smoker but to get more flavor in my smokes. It's like I've been riding the train to flavor town but it keeps breaking down. This smoke tube was recommended to me and I put it to use on a brisket the day I got it.It takes a bit of checking to make sure you get the pellets lit well enough to stay smouldering . What you need to know is that some pellets will spill out after you lay it on its side so you need to have enough pellets lit to get past that spill out point. Or fill it 85% full so they don't spill out. Once it's going it burns easily in my smoker. I got just over 5.5 hours of smoke out of it. It added a lot more smoke flavor to my brisket. I finally got to flavor town. It's still not like using solid wood or charcoal but a lot more smoke flavor is added with this little contraption.

  I'm new to the hobby, so take my comments with a grain of salt.These things are at a great price and they're fairly sturdy constrution, but I managed to lose a screw on one of mine, and the other actually had a screw snap off.  I recommend checking with a torx bit (T7 IIRC) to see if any of your screws are loose, and if they are, remove the loose screws, put some loctite on them, screw them back in, and then let them cure over night.If you should happen to discover you've lost a screw, they use the same size screws as the old CD ROM mounting screws from days of old.Minor point to note, but the T latch is on the side of the safe handle, whereas most tutorials I've seen have them on the side of the bite handle.  Also, you might just want to remove the T latch, on one of mine it swings freely and gets in the way, whereas on the other it stays in place.  Also, don't try squeezing to release the T latch, it wont work and that's how one of my screws snapped off.I was happy enough with the purchase to order a second set.  On both sets the black knife is much stiffer (as others have noted).  I put some oil on all of them (Sentry Tuf Glide Dry Film Rust Inhibitor -- was available for next day on Amazon,) and the second black knife really loosened up, whereas I suspect I just need to work on breaking in the first.

  First off, we got only one product in the first batch, but a quick email later and the company made good on it and re-sent both of them. Kudos to customer service. My son reports that they loosen up quickly and that the black one is slightly snugger that the silver one, I suppose because of the powder coating. He's enjoying them thoroughly. I'd probably get them again when he wears them out.

  When I received this mat, it had a very strong odor so I posted here asking for feedback and the company posted a respond on how to clean the mat to eliminate the odor within an hour of my posting.  I responded to them, before I use vinegar on the mat I wanted to ensure if in fact the odor doesn't clear from what they offered that I could still return it or would it void my return.  NO response.  I've now posted that question three times in a few days (amazon won't post a question without a response) and the company won't respond.  I am left to assume that while they encourage you to clean it with vinegar once you do, it voids a return so you are left with a smelly mat.  I'm returning it before I try cleaning it based on the other reviews here that the smell doesn't in fact go away.

  Been looking at rangefinders for about a month trying to decide if getting one would really be an asset to my golf game. Considered getting a $200 one but that seemed like an unreasonable risk if I ended up not liking it or finding out it doesn't help my game. Found this one and decided I could do $90 and not feel bad if it was something I didn't end up liking/using. It's had great reviews so far so i went for it.Really wasn't expecting much out of a $90 golf-rangefinder, but I've been pleasantly surprised with this product! For the price and function, you cannot beat it. Slope function works great, target accuracy is spot on, and the fact that it runs on AAA's is just a bonus (CR2's are pricey for a battery, but AAAs are cheap as dirt). Magnification is more than sufficient and very clear (adjust clarity by turning eyepiece); unless you've got it set up on a tripod, getting a good read on something beyond 150 is always going to be a little tricky, doesn't matter what rangefinder/brand you're using. My only unknown right now is the durability of it, but it does have a 12-month warranty on it so really no matter how you look at it this is totally worth a shot. (UPDATE: had it for a year, no issues. Still haven‚Äôt upgraded becuz this things has been GREAT!)My suggestion if you're thinking about getting a rangefinder to help with golf: Get this one. For $90 its a chance to see if it really helps your game, and it functions well enough to really help you make a decision. This has really helped my game more than I expected and I didn't have to break the bank to do it. I'll still probably upgrade to a nicer brand (most likely PrecisionPro since they do lifetime battery supply) but now I've got at least a year to save the money while I use this one. Even then, I'll probably just give this one to my son or keep as an extra to give to someone I'm golfing with for them to use.GREAT product! Totally worth trying it out. $90 for a golf rangefinder that works THIS well: you can't go wrong!

  I am an avid golfer.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now (roughly 5 times) and am very satisfied with it's performance.  I also use a hip GPS and compare it to that and it is very close to spot on.The manual is easy enough to follow, and the buttons are easy to use.  I'm attaching two images taken from my phone (so ignore any black boarders, these do not appear in use).  The pin seek feature is fantastic.  I believe for tournaments you need to have the slope feature turned off though, and I'm not sure if that feature exists.  If it does, I will update this review.  Otherwise, you can just use Mode 1 (M1) and scan for a target.Overall I am very pleased with this.  It has gone above my expectations. A few of these reviews seem a little fishy (who points this at a building?), so I wanted to provide a real review.  For golf use, 100% would purchase it again or as a gift for someone.  Construction is solid and the vibration feature is great.  I can use it easy enough with sunglasses, and the focus is easy to adjust with the rotating ring around the viewport.I do not know if it has a low battery alert on the display, but maybe in the next revision they could add it.  I also wish it would immediately take a distance with just one button push, but I believe the first press is to ""wake it up"", so no real worries here.

  I will say the product is better than expected with a few things that can be improved. First of all, I was surprised to find a range finder with a slope calculation feature at this price. I compared the accuracy with Bushnell range finder I have for distances less than 100 yards. They are almost identical within 100 yards. I haven't tested for more than 100 yards yet. I'll do so in coming weekend.There are two things I didn't like about this product.1. If you adjust focus, it affects the clarity of display(yardage numbers, slope and so on displayed inside the scope). I thought this was strange. Other range finders I tried didn't do that. Also, the display would be better if it's little more vivid.2. You have to press down quite firmly on buttons. Maybe I'm used to Bushnell on which you don't have press down hard.Overall, I will say I'm happy with this product so far(more testings will be coming soon). It doesn't feel cheap at all.As long as distances more than 100 yards are accurate enough when it's tested, I'll boost my rating to 5 star.Edited:I purchased another one(newer model). It's better than the previous model. The accuracy is as good as Bushnell. Pin-seeker technology is better with the jolt function. It vibrates when it detects the pin. I'm boosting it to 5 star.

  This rangefinder is AMAZING and that is not an overstatement. I would say i am an intermediate golfer and it has been an awesome tool to have. I take it out to the range to pin point my iron distances and in the course it made my choice of clubs way easier than just guessing the yardage. It comes with a nice hard case and a strap. The rangefinder itself is sturdy and doesnt look cheap. I paid less than $90 and i think its worth every penny. Equipped with all the modes a golfer would ever need. Its shocking to see that other $200 rangefinders doesnt even have the features this one has (like the slope). In terms of accuracy, i tested it on the range and on the course, comparing it to GPS and the yardage markers, and the results were shocking, it was better than i thought. Within 100 yards it was dead set accurate. Outside 100 yards was also pretty accurate, sometimes dead set or off by a yard or two. Overall, great product and i would recommend this to all types of golfers!

  As a new boat owner, I am proud of the boat and not so much of my docking skills.  The scuff eraser helped me to reconcile these. My first docking maneuvers left unsightly scuffs from plastic dock bumpers on the nearly flawless gel coat of the boat.  The scuff eraser powered by passion to restore my pride in the boat and hide deficiencies in my docking skills made the trick. It took not more than 15 minutes to remove most of the unsightly scuffs ( a few more than covered in the photos). I consider this close to magic. Unfortunately, the eraser suffered a lot from performing this trick and retired to the waste bin. Overall, it's a good product to restore your pride and boost confidence, but it's short of magic as you likely will need a new eraser to keep the magic going.

  After a long tuna fishing trip we had to deep clean the boat. There was one area on the fiberglass that I hit with soap and water and a stiff brush maybe 3 times. I finally walked away. Went back down to the boat 2 days later and tried again. Forgot that I had purchased these. Then sitting there in my dock box were these magic erasers. Added a little bit of water and rubbed a few times and the mark was gone. Then I proceeded to go around the entire cockpit and hit little areas that I otherwise would have accepted as clean. So far after first use I would say these are a must. They are firmer than others I've tried and didn't seem to wear prematurely. Time will tell but these are no longer in the dock box they made it on the boat full time. Boston whaler 315 conquest.

  Having owned and used binoculars most of my life, both from the decks of small pleasure boats and the pilothouses of large commercial ships, I can tell you these represent a tremendous value.  With 10X magnification, they would not be ideal as your only set of binoculars on a boat, where sea motion makes anything stronger than about 7X impractical to hold steadily.  But on land, at a sporting event or concert, you can really get a closeup with these--clear and crisp.  They're incredibly compact, easy to use and for the price...?  I may get a couple more pair, for the picnic basket, the glove box of my car, whatever.  Unless you're equipping for a night time military operation or something, just get a pair of these!

  I use these mainly for hiking. The binoculars are fairly compact light weight and have a nice feel to them --- They were just the right size and weight to carry on my hip for multiple miles. The included neck starp is okay , but I wish it was a little longer. Clarity is better than expected for a pair of binoculars in this price range. They also work fairy well in low light conditions. I am able to see in the woods with them until it's too dark for me to go. They're also small enough to take to baseball games, graduation, etc. With standing out in the crowd. I'd highly recommend these binoculars across hiking and sports events. If u are tired of thr really cheap compact binoculars that don't stay aligned or have poor image quality, try a pair of these compact binoculars.

  I have 10x42 Nikon Action binoculars for bird watching and carrying it always in my car. however, for sometimes while roaming around the streets of euro, it is not that easy to take with you for watching migrating birds hence 10x25 is extremely suitable for your bag since it is small but works really well.If you need a second one for your daily usage, this is the one with its low price. Another opportunity to use this binocular is to get your child's attraction for bird watching, it is small enough for small kids if they are interested in your bird watching activities.

  My young son is a budding ""nature tracker/science kid"" and spends so much time exploring the world around him. He was putting so much good use into his children's ""play"" binoculars that I decided to invest in a ""real"" set for him. Finding a pair that were light enough and small enough to fit in his hands was a challenge but I found it in these compact binoculars. I love how they fold even smaller when not in use but spread enough that he and I can both use them, plus they work great!

  I bought these binoculars in order to have a light weight, compact option when I dont want to carry my heavier binoculars, that I also purchased this one. This is a decent option at an attractive price. They are not as bright as my more expensive (x5) set, but are adequate. Light weight, compact size and easy to adjust diopter make this an attractive value, that added very little weight to my carry on bag for airline travel.

  Wife likes compact binoculars she can grab quickly and use without much thought.  These are a little larger than others of this design I have owned, but not by much.  The optic appear to be right on and well aligned.  Field of view is decent, though maybe a bit narrow.  The housing is easy to grip and durable.  These are working well, in that we let them set around, handy, then when we need them, grab them and look.  Focus is quick and the eye relief feels just about right.

  We picked these compact binoculars for a trip to Southern California. Read the product page before buying and these do not disappoint. They may not have as wide of view as some of the bigger options but to keep in a pack and lightweight these are perfect. With this lightweight, easy to use binoculars we can see them more clearly then with our larger.

  I am really enjoying these little binoculars. They are great for everything from bird and deer watching in my backyard and the woods near my house to concerts and sporting events. I also own a pair of larger Nikon Prostaff 7S 10X42s that are awesome as well but these you hardly know are around your neck. Their small size and being able to take them easily and have them with me while hiking or doing outside activities was my reason for purchase. They come with a handy neck strap and travel case too. The optics are good, you can see perfectly and they focus great with adequate light but not quite there with my larger set. They are fine for the vast majority of what you would use binoculars for though. It's important to understand that not only these but any set of binoculars this size will not let in enough light for you to see well in lower light conditions.

  At 6'3 225 these Large shorts fit horribly. The butt is too tight. The crotch is too small leaving a bulge. The compression shorts are looser than the actual shorts. I like small/shorts but these are not proportional and cut from a horrible pattern.

  Quality is what you would expect for $20, so pretty happy there. But sizing is weird. Follow their sizing guide, but also consider one size up even from there. The shorts themselves are tight fit, but the compression shorts are not unless you have pretty large legs. If you follow their sizing guide your bulge will show.  Also the material is double layer mesh which I did not expect from the images. Looked like pretty lightweight shorts in images but its more medium weight.So basically not exactly what I expected but still pretty decent shorts if your legs fit the weird sizing.

  The outside layer of the shorts is cut very tight and short, I'm 5' 8"" ~190 lbs. and wear size L shorts from any major brand comfortably so I sized up to XL for these and they are tight all around my thighs and sit and inch or two above my knee when standing which I don't mind too much for running.  The inside ""compression"" lining is very disappointing, it is cut very loose and the material is so thin and weak that it offers very little athletic support.  Also, I have an Iphone 11 with a relatively thin case and when I put it in the pocket on the thigh it sags down and slides all over when you are running, so much so that I took it out and held it in my hand because that was more comfortable.  I was hoping for an alternative to an arm band for my phone when running and these did not provide that.

  I love this style of shorts. The inner material is absolutely great for hiking and working out. Keeps the chafing away. I actually bought a second pair a little larger because I liked this style.However, the outer shorts are a little tight. The inner feel great, they are right and fit well, but the outter short layer could be a little more loose.I still love them. I bought the larger size to try and fit better, I‚Äôm thinking of a third pair and going even larger.

  Order bigger! I weigh 115 and a size small was way too small on me.

  Ordered for my hubby but fits my 13 year old instead!! Size runs small but quality fabric and inside compression shorts a plus. He wears them to play basketball then can jump in pool without having to change clothes.

  Liner is far too loose for the fit of the shorts, the shorts were an appropriate fit for a US 34/L, but the liner was comparable to an XXL underwear, maybe a size 38, which doesn't make sense for this. I thoroughly read the reviews to get the right size, and it's not an issue of fit, the liner just needs to be much smaller compared to the shorts themselves.

  But after minimal use (two or three runs), there were numerous threads coming loose creating a pull in the shorts. At least 4 and the pocket had large excess thread, around 3' that pulled loose without an aggravation from me, I just felt something tickling my leg.Fits nice, looks nice. But not well made.
