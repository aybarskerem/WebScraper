  The first one I received quickly locked up and prevented downloading items from Microsoft store or even windows updates.  No matter what I tried, it would not work right.  During discussions with Amazon to return item, It was recommended that I try another one.  I did and that one has worked really, really well.  The start up time is pronominal, everything seems to work very well except for the battery life.  It goes quickly.  However, I am so happy with the rest of the laptop that I have chosen to ignore the number of times I have to hook up to charge.  Overall, it's a very good laptop which I did not think I would say based on the first one I got.  I gave it four stars because of all the problems with the first laptop.

  I love this small but mighty machine. It's perfect for daily computer tasks, streaming, video editing...it's intuitive and easy to use. Love love love it. Light weight too. When streaming, battery drains at a medium pace. I plug it in once a day with 8 he usage. It's just a really great, user friendly device. Highly recommend.

  I'm not sure why this is asking me to review the touch screen, as this Chromebook does not have that capability.This machine works perfectly fine. Holds a charge for a good amount of time, charges quickly, and works perfectly.The downside is that a lot of things I need, for example my cryptocurrency hard wallet are not supported by Chrome OS.So I'm selling my Chromebook and buying a windows-based laptop.

  Windows 10 FAILEDI have had a nightmare getting this Laptop up and running.  Windows 10 forces you to create a Microsoft account to start up the laptop.  Did it occur to Microsoft that I DO NOT WANT AN ACCOUNT WITH  THEM.  I bought a laptop with an operating system.  I don't necessary want to be FORCED to run everything thru MICROSOFT.Terrible experience......

  Pretty good, for those that are wondering. When I received this laptop, it only arrived with an M.2. No sata. Housing for the sata, but no sata only a blank box so the housing could mount. Still a solid computer, good for gaming and strong fans. Easy maintenance, thermal pads and paste are easily accessible. All though this was bought at walmart and everyone including these people have upped the price, but still a solid computer for the extra $200+ they slapped on it. This is an hp originally sold at walmart for around 545 dollars. Hope this review is helpful, enjoy the laptop.

  I like the Chromebook, but it restarts itself every day on its own. I've had it for less than a month. I believe the MicroSD card slot is too close to the power cord slot. I leverage my thumb on the side of the Chromebook to pull the power cord out (the spot where the MicroSD card slot is) so I end up uninstalling the card. No, there's no other way to carefully remove the power cord. I've had several Chromebooks and never had issues until this one.

  Purchased fully loaded, Dell XPS 13 (11th gen).  Everything as expected EXCEPT the micro SD slot does not allow the micro SD card to eject.  After researching on the web, this has been reported to Dell as a problem on the XPS 13 (9300 series) as early as 2019;  obviously still a problem.Updated 5-May-21:  Never Dell again.  Sent to Dell for repair, Dell said that, as the microSD port on the Motherboard was damaged, and as not covered by BASIC warranty, I had to pay 259 plus tax to get repaired.  I am having them return the laptop, and am investigating how to return to Amazon as ""received as damaged"".

"Apple MacBook Air MJVM2LL/A 11.6-Inch laptop(1.6 GHz Intel i5, 128 GB SSD, Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000, Mac OS X Yosemite (Renewed)",$399.00,"
  Overall I‚Äôm quite happy with this purchase so far. The laptop shipped a lot earlier than the estimated delivery date, and arrived in new condition with no damage or scratches. The laptop runs great for what I need it for, which is mainly word processing. It has difficulty with video streaming but this could be due to an outdated or missing plugin. The wireless does not run as fast as I‚Äôd hoped and the battery life is (understandably) reduced from the product description‚Äôs purported ‚Äú10 hours of battery life.‚Äù I can get about three hours unplugged if I‚Äôm not using a lot of internet or CPU power. It charges back up again very quickly though. It also only has four GB of RAM, something I wish I‚Äôd been more careful to check before I ordered this. As a result the laptop bogs down quite quickly while multitasking. However, I love the feel of the keyboard and the backlit keys, and I‚Äôm quite happy with it as a little writing machine.This laptop is an excellent inexpensive option for students or people looking for a *very* lightweight and functional laptop for writing, note taking, and general office tasks. However, this is by no means a gaming laptop, and it is hard-pressed to handle high performance demands or high-bandwidth internet tasks like streaming or large downloads.

  ¬†This is not a technical review. I decided to buy a laptop for my son, when I was very happy with his report card. I knew the spec's of the laptop I wanted. I did some research and watched many videos. I decided to go for a Razer 15"". Searched around a lot for it, however; didn't like the look of it. It was also very expensive in my opinion. But the most important factor was the look. It had no soul in it. I love the features and functions this one offers (Turbo, the Predator button, RGB keyboard, the outline, ...). I did read the con's and pro's. Finally I purchased it along with a Razer Kraken Gaming headset, a Razer BlackWidow Mechanical gaming keyboard, a Razer Mumba Mouse, a Razer Based Station Headphone, and a Razer Firefly Mousepad.My son loves this laptop, and it's been working for him with no issues.

  Laptop was good but incredibly basic and too much money for its limited capability, also too small for my interest, so I returned it. The seller made me pay a $100 restocking fee!!! I've never seen something like that before and its ridiculous. It was deducted from my refund. Definitely don't buy unless you're sure. Its a good laptop you get what you ask for but the seller is unreasonable in the refund aspect. And It took 10 days after they received the item for me to even get my heavily deducted refund.

  Fast shipping, product as described, but the power cord/charger is for US and I am in Australia. I need to get a compatible AC charger for my country.
