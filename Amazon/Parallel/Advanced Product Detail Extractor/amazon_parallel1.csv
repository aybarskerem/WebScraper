"HP 15 Laptop, 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD Storage, 15.6” Full HD IPS Display, Windows 10 Home, HP Fast Charge, Lightweight Design (15-dy2021nr, 2020)",$717.99,3.0,"
  This is a good decent laptop for school kids or college students. Not for business use. The specs on the sellers site are deceiving. The screen quality is not what it says. It's just a typical LCD screen that has a little more brightness than it's older predecessor. It does not have backlit keys and the keyboard lettering can't hardly be seen.The laptop feels cheap and fragile. I get worried when carrying it. Hard drive is not upgradeable. The battery life does not last as long as stated in the Sellers site. We ran tests using several programs and browsing the internet. Overall, it is not designed for creative design. As stated it is good for home use, school kids and college students. Not good for traveling even though it is a little light and it is overpriced. We donated ours to a school.

  As I expected, and unfortunately am right...this is LOUSY and I do NOT need the frustration...First it said I wasn't hooked up with Microsoft....then when I called for help it told me to go to the website!! Finally I got a human being....they said we could bypass MIcrosoft....(when doe sTHAT become a problem?)  To do THAT...i had to shut down my rotor, with other household members using it...NO  WAY...It is going BACK in the box and BACK to Amazon in the morning..I did NOT pay all this money for frustration and irritation....No idea when I'll ever order another NEW computer....I'll stick to used TYVM

  Camera and microphone didn’t work. Called hp for help. Told me it was a refurbished computer and couldn’t fix the problem. Takes very long time to get your money back. Be Aware!!

  I've had this product for about a month and really have no complaints.  Boots up quick with no delay.  My only issue is with the on/off switch.  It's too small.  Also, I miss not having an indicator light showing when ""caps lock"" is on.  Other than these two issues I really like the unit!

  So far I have had this laptop for like 5 hours and i already am in love with it.  It moves light years faster than my husbands Hp and the screen quality is phenomenal.  I am looking forward to using this laptop more through my next few years of college.  The only thing that would have made the laptop better would be a backlit keyboard, other than that at this time it's a perfect fit for what i need it to do.

  Set up was a breeze. Screen size and keyboard are great. The price was great. I'm glad it's not a touchsceen. I had that feature on my last one and I would only recommend that if you really need it. Brushing hair or lint off the screen always messed things up. So far this laptop has been awesome and just what i needed.

  Great laptop. Even tho its a 3070 you still gotta mess w nvidias 3D settings and with the games internal vsync settings to really optimize each game. 360 hz is awsome but don't play demanding games at high settings with 360 hz cause the screen completely glitches out. Took me a week of internal pain to figure that out. They run smooth at 60hz w vsync (depending on game) though. For games that don't have a refresh rate option in their settings (weird but games such as Sniper Elite 4 don't have it) go to the razer synapses and change it in the performance tab to 60. Then when ur done playing go back and change it to 360 if you want. Kinda a hassle but that's what you get with a machine like this. You just can't win lol. Overall awsome powerhouse that's so slim and fits right in your backpack without taking much space. But omg the power supply is so thiccc. Battery life is awsome, given that it's an insanely powerful gaming laptop. Lasts almost 3 hours when using google nonstop. Look if you want battery life get a Mac. But for gaming this thing rocks. Just have some patience and once you set up everything you'll begin planning your wedding to this thing. Peace.

  The computer is really nice. I'm not an expert on gaming computers or anything like that. It is my first gaming laptop. When playing games, the computer does get decently hot. The fans start running harder almost instantly when running a game but the way it looks and feels, is totally great.

  I was actually surprised at how well this computer performs while multitasking. I use this laptop with an external monitor as well as a Bluetooth mechanical keyboard. Right now it’s my daily driver for a workstation until my new desktop comes in and it’s getting the job done. It is capable of getting 144fps in Fortnite I haven’t tried any other games on it though.

  First things first, I am writing this review on this laptop right now, and it's absolutely amazing for typing, the touchpad is nice and responsive, and the screen is vibrant and bright. My only gripes are with two things. One:  The battery management system, tries its best to switch between the Nvidia gpu and the integrated one, but ultimately doesn't pick the one I would have wanted 30% of the time, and I need to go into the Nvidia contol panel to change it, then restart the laptop. Also, due to the fact that drainning a lithium battery too quickly damages it, the laptop reduces the maximum performance when not plugged in. I can reasonably get 5 or 6 hours of use out of it when I'm not doing more than browsing or watching a video, but if you plan on gaming while on bettery you're looking at no more than an hour and a half.Two: The surface finish is impossible to keep clean. it looks great if you wipe it down with a microfiber cloth, but as soon as you touch it, there's fingerprints everywhere, and it looks like I just mashed a greasey cheeseburger all over it. I might get a vinyl skin for the lid and the palm rest, but i'll wait and see how bad it really is. This next part is not Razer's fault, but just a problem I had with Corsair's Icue peripheral service. I installed Icue to integrate with mouse and my headphones, and I noticed that I was getting only 2 hours of bettery life, which confused me. It turns out the driver was hitting the cpu with just enough requests that it was running at its full frequency all the time. I had to just uninstall it to get my 6 hours of battery life back. Other than that, this laptop manages to pack an insane amount of power and performance into a surprisingly thin but dense package, and I love that about it. It feels solid and has almost no plastic and no cheap feeling parts. When it's plugged in I can barely tell the difference bewteen it and my desktop at home which really shows just how far technology has improved in just a year. Funnily enough, the silicon shortage has hit other manufactureres so bad, that their cheaper plastic laptops with the same parts are actually more expensive that this much nicer product. I plan on keeping this for a long time, and I can definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a product that they plan on using for workstation or gaming purposes.

  Good performance, great trackpad! Coming from a Macbook Pro and XPS 15 which each sport 500+ nits of brightness I was worried about this laptop's advertised 300 nits but was pleasantly surprised to find that it's still a really bright screen!

  This laptop is a wonderful laptop but… I highly recommend getting some type of a cooling pad because without this laptop gets very warm very fast. Other than that it is a wonderful laptop.

  El computador es hermoso y tal cual se indica en la descripción, el teclado tiene un tacto suave pero a la vez la firmeza suficiente para estar seguro de que se apretó la tecla.Pantalla mate, con recarga rápida. Los parlantes son espaciales y funcionan 10/10. En realidad cumple con todo lo dicho en la descripción.

  I purchased this because my son needed my laptop. At first, I thought it was great. All I really did was search the web and visit sites. It's fast and nice for that. Once I downloaded my Silhouette Studio program, I have trouble now doing anything due to low disc space. This is pretty upsetting since this is the only program I have downloaded. I don't stream Netflix or anything like that. I didn't realize how bad it was until months later now that I need to work on projects with this software. I don't recommend using this for a cricut or silhouette.

  I purchased this computer purposely for school and web surfing. The computer has nice looking features and it hasn’t given me any problems. However, I would not recommend it for anything other than web surfing, reading articles, doing research and typing up documents. This computer has very little storage room. I am unable to save all of my school related documents due to this issue. Other than that, it’s great. Also, you’ll have to get a mouse. Using the finger touch mouse on the lap top can get annoying.

  I bought this laptop for my daughter to use for school.  She is ten.  We received it and almost immediately, it stopped charging.  I thought, no big deal, it's probably a defective charger.  I bought a new charger.  Same thing.  So I contacted HP Support.  They fixed the computer and sent it back to me.  However, they reinstalled Windows 10, which deleted my one year free trial of Microsoft Office.  I contacted them about this and they said that I would just have to download the one month free trial or purchase it for $69.99.  I specifically purchased this laptop for the one year free trial and HP refuses to fix the problem that is THEIR fault.  If it hadn't been for a faulty laptop in the first place, it wouldn't have needed to have Windows reinstalled.  I will never again purchase an HP product.  Buyer, beware!

  Honestly if you wanna computer for school with the basic needs this computer is for you. I don’t get how people complain about the storage but honestly you can buy the SD card and put it in your computer and you can have more storage at the beginning I was debating Whether to buy it but I ended up buying it and it works amazing and it looks fabulous on my desk. love the color couldn’t ask for more . The way they pack the computer to ship it to you is well done.I’m really happy with my purchase :)

  I have been looking at many models of laptops for gaming.  It was coming down to the blade, asus zephyrus m15 or the msi gs66.  I ended up with the blade because I just thought screw it and went with the most expensive one.  I have researched ALOT leading up to me deciding which to buy.  Ive seen and read the horror stories people posted on reviews and reddit about Razer's QC.  I also have seen very satisfied customers too so I prayed for the best.  Luckily my unit after I have been using for about 3,4 days now have no problem at all.  I see no major screen bleeding at all there is very small bleed on the right hand corner but basically that's it.The keyboards are not very to my liking.  I was using Lenovo Y520 before this and even on that cheap model, the keyboards were way better for me.  I think that the blade keyboards are abit too mushy for me.The speakers are also abit on the weaker side.  I wish they would just be a little more meaty.  I'm not sure how to explain it but even my old Lenovo was better and i hated those.The top part of the chassis near the screen gets VERY hot when under heavy loud like gaming.  I couldnt touch it for more than 3,4 seconds, but then again noone touches that area anyway so it doesnt really matter.  It also got cool to the touch very fast though after you stop gaming which really surprised me.All in all those are really the only thing I ""dislike"".  They really are nit picky but im actually really pleased with this device.  I will try to post here again if i encounter any problems later on.  For now i think they are great.  I also mostly see reported problems on last year's model with the i7 9th gen and this years 1660ti gpu model.  If I were you I would try to avoid those and get the more expensive one just in case.  All in all this is a good buy for me, just pray you get a good working model and you wont regret it!

  Shortly after arrival the laptop needed to be returned due to a fan issue.  It arrived back at the manufacturer one week ago.  Manufacturer support has been very polite in responding to my grandsons inquiries and informing him a new laptop would be sent.  He is disappointed and anxious and was told today that it will be shipped in 3-5 days.  He loved it for about 2 weeks before it had to be returned and what was supposed to be a special gift is now more concern than celebration.  As the purchaser, I'd like a definitive response to when it will arrive.  If that isn't possible, I'd prefer a refund for the laptop and the protection plan.

  Laptop is wonderful. well built, sleek and compact. the screen is beautiful and it runs very demanding games, albeit at pretty high temps. seriously gets hot, but it's a gaming laptop. only other gripe with the laptop itself is the rubber bumpers on the bottom are uneven and makes it wobble a bit. shouldn't be a terribly hard fix though.Amazon on the other had is what drags this review down. They have some false advertisements on the page. the main one being the store page says it has a touch screen, while it doesn't.  Had to talk to 4 reps trying to add the insurance to the purchase (store page says you can add it up to 30 days from purchase) only to be told they couldn't do it. 3 of the people just hung up without saying a word. The last one said all I can do to get what I wanted is to return the laptop, wait 2-3 weeks for amazon to receive it (even though I got it in one) and then wait another week for my refund, then repurchase the laptop and add the insurance. while I would like very much to do that, I need this laptop for work as well as gaming so I can't really be without it for so long.Oh, and as it's an expensive delivery, they require a signature for drop off. I took the day off and hangout waiting for the delivery only for the amazon driver to just throw it on my porch and leave without so much as ringing the bell.TLDR; laptop is great, purchase it if you see a decent sale, just don't bother purchasing through amazon. Too much hassle to deal with their incompetence.

  The first time a deliver guy put my mail in the back door，I also called customer service to check my email.But about the laptop is perfect.That is amazing！I using MacBook long time，I know ios is good for office but no gaming，so I just want to buy the Win10 for some games，but I didn't have much hope for the Razer，I can not believe the 144Hz screen will be clearer than the MacBook，but It is do that！i7-10750 CPU and 2060 Max-Q GPU let me get a new world like haven！

  I could immediately tell from the packaging that Razer is not messing around. Everything was professionally packaged and upon opening, everything is high quality and created with love of gaming in mind.This computer runs great, plays all my games on max settings and doesn't get too loud. The screen, keyboard, speakers, trackpad, RGB, everything is top notch as I expected it to be. I bought a Bluetooth Razer mouse to go along with it and I now have the ultimate laptop gaming setup.Thank you Razer.

  This laptop was clearly not functional within an hour of setting it up.  It bluescreens constantly, and none of the typical things you'd do to diagnose and fix the bluescreens fixed it.  This included a total fresh reinstall of Windows as well as a number of software diagnostics recommended by Lenovo.  None of it worked.  This is clearly a hardware problem, so I returned it.  Amazon's return policy states that if they disagree with your assessment that the computer doesn't work, they'll charge you a fee ($165) for restocking.  That's what they did to me.  So they intend to sell you the same broken laptop they sold me.  Buyer beware!

  This is my 1st gaming laptop and I did a ton of research before pulling the trigger. For the price, it's a beast. Unfortunately mine is defective and drops 15-21% of frames in high resolution video playback. I bought it for 4k video editing as well as gaming so this is a BIG issue. I'm now wrestling with Lenovo to get it fixed or replaced. I 'd like to return it but at this point I wish I had researched the seller a little. Please don't misunderstand, their price was great, shipping was very fast but their return policy is so harshly rigid its clear they do not actually accept returns.  Words of warning: if you order from them, keep everything associated w your package and keep it in perfect condition. If you try for a return(good luck!) repack everything so that it looks as though the box was never opened, if not it will be rejected and you are paying shipping both ways. I will update this review once my machine is fixed or replaced.

  love the design not only is this laptop a beast at gaming ,but also looks and feels sleek and doesn't just look like a gaming laptop. The main games i play are rust and modern warfare , they run amazing at high settings. The fan noise isn't to bad either i have owned a older laptop before hand and that one was much much louder. screen is a bit small for me for gaming ,but thats because im used to a 27 inch monitor from my desk top. The only  thing i can think about disliking is the 512 ssd storage ,but you can always just unscrew the 11 screws on the bottom and plug a 2 tb ssd right next to it so not really a big deal. If you need a portable ,fast ,sleek gaming laptop this is the one for you.

  A vertical line appeared on the screen, I read reviews of the 1660ti variant and some users have had the same issue. I used this laptop very  lightly and carefully during 2 weeks, sometimes I opened it and the screen was black and sometimes I couldn't adjust brightness. I was tempted to buy a m1 macbook but I decided  to buy this unit for the extra ram, I regret it now.

  The laptop shipped quickly.  It appears pretty sturdy, though a bit plasticky.  The keyboard is great, much better feel than my work laptop or my older samsung laptop.  The screeen is bright and sharp.  I'm impressed by the system speed.  Proper dual channel 3200MHz ram, fast 4800H cpu.  While running a few quick tests, the system was running 4.09GHz all core for the cpu-z stress test.  The fans are quiet and the keyboard and deck area were cool during ~20 minutes of gaming.  There are always better products on the horizon, but overall I'm pleased with this laptop.Update 5-10-21:  I continue to be impressed with this laptop.  It runs newer games very well and older games at ridiculous frame rates ( Portal and Talos Principle running at 200+ FPS).  The cooling system works very well and the integrated graphics can run many of my games at reasonable frame rates.  The battery life isn't that great, but long enough to watch a movie. Very pleased for the price.

  Laptop came factory sealed and in perfect condition. Beast Amd 2060 115w!*1 month update*I've traveled with it and used it pretty heavily and can say that this thing is amazing. Games run smooth, cyber punk on ultra with rtx on dlss on balanced I get about 55 fps, no rtx I can get 70+ on ultra. Temps are ridiculously low, gpu never goes over 70c at 97 to 99% performance. I'm coming from console so I was very skeptical of gaming on a laptop but I'm pretty sure I'll never buy a console ever again. After playing on ultra in a few games trying to play games on ps4 looks awful, I understand why pc players never turn back to consoles. This laptop provides the same games with better graphics at higher frame rates and its portable!

  This laptop has everything you need to game. RTX 2060 115W variant? Yes sir and also a chasis and cooling system good enough to handle it. AMD Ryzen 7 4800H? 8 cores and 16 threads? 4.2Ghz core speed? Oh yeah, best mobile CPU of 2020, yeah Intel i7 10750H can turbo 1 core to 5Ghz and gains like 3-5 FPS more, but its a 6 core CPU with heating issues unless you undervolt.

  This HP Chromebook looks and feels far more expensive and better made than its price led me to believe. The keyboard is outstanding with a soft but firm touch. My wife has never been a fan of touch pads, but she likes this touch pad so much that she no longer connects a mouse to use with this HP. The convertible and touch screen are just great added bonuses.We purchased this as an Amazon refurbished model and were thrilled that it actually did arrive ""like new"".

  I've been breaking in this puppy for a week now and feel motivated to write a review.  First off there are a couple of inaccuracies in the description--the computer DOES have a touch screen, and the RAM speed is 1600MHz, not 3200Mhz.  Beyond that all is described okay.I spent a couple of days burning in the computer with the freeware benchmarking program SiSoft Sandra Lite...no real surprises there.  The system outranked 87 percent of their database, with excellent scores for the processor, SSD drive and RAM (even though it's only 1600MHz).  It only garnered poor scores for its graphics, so if you're at all into 3D gaming look elsewhere.  For my uses it should be fine, though I would have liked to see a graphics score that wasn't bottom of the barrel.  My only other minor gripe is the color quality--initially videos appeared too dark.  I downloaded AMD's Radeon Software package, which allows me to adjust the brightness, hue and color temperature and I'm still dialing it in.So what do I like about it?  Lots of things.  I appreciate the backlit keyboard.  Though I use a mouse, the touchpad is better than many I've experienced.  The keyboard feel is good.  One reason I went for a 15-incher over a 14 was the numeric keypad, which I like.  Though I've used it very little so far, the touch screen simplifies some tasks.  I appreciate the full-HD 1920 x 1080 screen resolution--My last laptop was 1024 x 768 and this has much less eyestrain.  I like the 15.6"" screen much better than a 14"".  The screen is also visible from different angles.  I like the thin case and the light weight.  The 16GB RAM is overkill for me but it's nice to have it there for multi-tasking and video editing if I need it.This beast is a full-featured computer for well under $1000.  It's about the same price as those glorified tablets from Microsoft, Google and Apple with 10""-12"" screens, tiny drives and slower processors.  It hits a sweet spot in several areas for me...I spent a lot of time researching the purchase to include all the features I wanted.

  loving my new computer, the only thing complaint i have is that i can't use the fingerprint sign it. I've been able to use it once !

  I found this laptop to be very snappy & high quality. The specs speak for themselves. The screen is beautiful & the touchscreen feature is nice to have.

  It has been like this for hours, can't shut down can't do anything!

  What initially attracted me to the laptop was the price for the specs and processor offered. it's a durable laptop with a nice display and the laptop is very fast with an SSD. The fingerprint reader is also great I thought that was a nice touch. Unfortunately just like everything else in this world this item has flaws. The first flaw I would like to mention is it overheats very quickly.  Also, the battery isn't very good I assume the battery life is average though. It also isn't the best laptop for running games it does better on some games more than others. Just depends on what games you like. Granted, this laptop wasn't made for running games. Overall, I would still reccomend this laptop to a friend.

  I was so disappointed. This laptop had everything that I had hoped for except that the screen was so dim. Unfortunately I did return it because I couldn’t stand that even on full brightness it was lackluster. Other than screen brightness this laptop has it all.

  I needed a more powerful graphics card than my ancient desktop AiO for modern image processing software. This one fit the bill. One of the approved processors was a Radeon. Since I was getting a Radeon, I got a Ryzen 7 4700U. Plenty of power.My only real complaint is the micro SD card slot instead of a full size. I took an old 32 GB card and put it in as an additional drive. I use a USB adapter for full size SD cards. Waste not, want not.Add a wireless mouse and done. I'm still looking for a good prop to elevate the keyboard a bit. The power brick works. So does the umbrella from my briefcase. Both are a bit higher than I need, although the umbrella has a nice damped feel.5/12 Update: There were too many dongles, so I added:A bit more memory--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0887P21Z2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_3SB2H3CXT0H0F1JFN968?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1A Bluetooth mouse--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07C2NL5HK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_2RT9G4WET9CRGTEMPR1M?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1A USB-C card reader for full sized SD cards--https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07ZKRM12C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_VYKCAADQWBETHN337JG1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

  I've only had this laptop for a few days so I am writing a review accordingly. So to start off, I'm not a huge tech person at all. I have a smart  Phone and have done everything from that period the last time that I had a laptop was probably  about 7 years ago.I recently started a business where I will be shipping products and printing invoices and  things of that nature. I knew I would either need a laptop or a desktop to do so. I figured a laptop would be perfect for now since its portable and I can take it anywhere.I initially ordered a chromebook off of Walmart.com and was so disappointed.  The screen and picture was so dim that it hurted my eyes. There was no way to adjust brightness.  There was no cap lock button and several other disturbing things...lol it went back the next day.Came to Amazon and saw this beautiful red hp laptop.  Took a chance and so far I'm loving it. Again,  I'm not a super tech gal or anything like that so I can't tell you how storage and all the specs will work. I like this laptop because it's semi huge. I'm a female with big hands and the keyboard is perfect for me.The Chromebook I sent back would load web pages super slow even when sitting right next to my modem.  As for this hp laptop, I'm out on my back porch and modem is upstairs and it's still loading with n0 problem at all.I wasn't quite sure what S mode was when I ordered it but it took 2 minutes to get it out of S mode. I went to gmail.com to check my emails and a message from gmail popped up in the right hand corner that said you are not using a Google browser and click her to get Google browser.  That's it that's all and my laptop is out of S mode.I have used it to create several word documents for my website so far.  Hooked up perfectly to my printer. Beautiful Color!! Keyboard is not backlight but its really nice so who cares. So far so good. Also shipping was really fast.  It was due on Wednesday but got her on Monday.

  My husband only likes HP computers. He had been wanting a laptop that he could use to pay bills, watch some youtube videos and surf the internet and not have to use his phone.I order this for him for Father's Day.

  I needed a notebook type laptop with built-in camera and audio to conduct meetings on Zoom, stream Netflix, surf/ browse the internet, compose Microsoft documents (I purchased and installed my own Microsoft office 2019)..... In other words nothing heavy duty/schmancy. Have had it a few weeks, is performing very well, good battery life lightweight and thin. Good screen quality/ resolution. It would be nice if the keyboard was backlit, but it's not.....

  It has been just over a month since I got it. For what I do, email, read articles, shop, play poker, this is a great machine. It came within a reasonable time. My only complaint is that it comes with Windows 10 S. It says it comes with Windows 10 (check the chart), but it was in the S mode. It seemed simple to remove or shut off but it would not and after repeated attempts and some foul language at the Microsoft site, I appealed to their Community and went to bed. The second response the next day solved the issue and after following the prompts I was able to get it out of S mode. Props to the Microsoft Community. Now I can add any App (hello Chrome, bye Edge) I want regardless of Microsoft's feelings. If the chart had been correct or this had come without the S Mode this would be a 5-star review.It is thin and has a large screen. It has a louder volume from the speakers than my older HP Pavillion. That is a good thing as the last one was not loud enough. It is also lighter than my last one and the battery lasts about 4x as long. If there is a fan I can not hear it, but there seems to be very little heat.  So far so good.

  ive seen people say that the battery life isn't good, but I don't think those people understand that any time youre using a pc to game on, youre never gonna get more than a few hours unless youre willing to spend thousands on a laptop. the picture quality is ecxcellent. the specs overall are great for under 1k. its upgradable. it also has intel optane to go along with the ssd.ive seen people complain that the backlite for they keyboard wont stay on. ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO. with no use, the light goes off. all you have to do is touch the touchpad and they'll come back on. im not sure if there is a setting to change that because I havnt looked. I actually prefer that to minimize battery use.while using without gaming, the battery life is actually pretty good.so far ive played terraria and fallout 76, and they both play great on ultra settings. I think im going to install battlefield 5 and see how it runs. not a big fan of the game itself, but that's the most resource intense game I own, kinda curious how itll run.the laptop is more than vr readyI love how the keyboard feels for gaming and for typing.oh, ive also seen people comment that the laptop would not turn on once receiving.... mine didn't either, YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE BATTERY, LOLoh, and I also received the laptop within a day and a half. ordered friday night, and got it sunday.overall I highly recommend

  This has been a great computer, plays everything that I've thrown at it, not at top specs but more then enough for me.  Thermal control is better then expected, it can be a little loud but nothing near my last asus ROG machine.  I upgraded to 16GB ram and windows ran better but didn't notice a ton in games.Pros:-Bang for your buck-USB-C-easy to upgrade-Looks like a gaming laptop without being obnoxious-Power brick is really compact for this type of computerCons:-The middle hinge is a little scary, you have to open it from the middle.  If you open it with the corners it flexes the screen a lot.-Wish the power button was on the side so I don't have to open it when it's plugged into my monitor-Battery life is good for a gaming laptop but realistically 3-4 hours of normal use.  1-2 hours of gaming maybe.-USB-C isn't thunderbolt

  So as you all know, earlier this year I bought the HP Pavilion Gaming 15 core i5-8300H and had a hiccup that was resolved if you read my review on that one.  This time I bought the newer core i5-9300H model for a friend and I must say I love this new design.  It has larger vents for better air flow; 2 settings for the light in the keyboard (dim and bright green); the monitor is a bit more sturdy then the first which is a plus.  Overall this machine is definitely a 5 out of 5 for the price bracket.

  Pretty good, for those that are wondering. When I received this laptop, it only arrived with an M.2. No sata. Housing for the sata, but no sata only a blank box so the housing could mount. Still a solid computer, good for gaming and strong fans. Easy maintenance, thermal pads and paste are easily accessible. All though this was bought at walmart and everyone including these people have upped the price, but still a solid computer for the extra $200+ they slapped on it. This is an hp originally sold at walmart for around 545 dollars. Hope this review is helpful, enjoy the laptop.

  Aspire 5, Ryzen 3, Vega 3 Graphics, 16GB RAM DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD:On mine, the upgraded boot SSD came as a Kingston and the memory modules were Crucial brand. I was happy to see brand names that I recognized.I installed an expansion 1GB WD Blue SSD myself and am extremely happy with this little PC. The boot SSD does indeed run at NVMe speeds, 1646/929 MB/s sequential read/write. The WD Blue SSD that I installed runs 392/303 MB/s. I am pretty sure that the motherboard is the limiting factor on these speeds.The Windows 10 Task Manager shows the GPU as having reserved 2GB of RAM and is sharing 7GB Ram with the system. That seems reasonable to me.You can just buy the base model Aspire 5 and add all of this stuff yourself, saving some serious $. I had already upgraded the boot NVMe SSD on a different PC and just did not want to deal with that again, too many headaches for me getting Windows 10 uefi BIOS set up. The RAM and additional SSD are fairly simple DIY projects. This was a good purchase for me.

  I have zero negatives about this laptop or seller. As everyone does I researched the hell out of laptops before I made my purchase. The best recommended product was this exact Acer laptop & Thrilled it was selling on Amazon, MY FAV!I also made certain to read as many reviews as possible here on Amazon before putting my money down. I have never been happier purchasing a laptop. It came earlier than scheduled & packaged like new so I am giving high marks to the seller!It was larger than the company laptop I was working on but thinner & lighter, Yeah! The set up took less than 20 minutes & I have been loving it ever since. I highly recommend this laptop even if you have a large budget to spend.I did spend the extra money to get the warranty but did not purchase any of the additions they recommend, ie office, adobe, etc. Since I read the reviews & saw how many people were unhappy with them I chose not to purchase & happy I didn't. I have not needed any additions, my Acer has everything I need already built in.

  We bought 2 of these with the 16gb and 512 ssd for school and work. This laptop doesn’t disappoint it’s quick and responds  very quickly. The only thing is one laptop says it has Alexa built in which I can’t find and the other one doesn’t say anything.

  this computer is expensive to get the bigger hard drive 1TB. and it comes loaded with old software from2014 mostly and is STUCK in Windows ""S MODE"". sure there are ways that are SUPPOSED to remove it but they dont work - so you are stuck with lots and lots of Microsoft pop=ups constantly trying to sell you things thru Microsift Store AND bombarding your email which you must provide to activate Windows at all.  S MODE allows you opnly to add apps that are sold and ""approved"" by Microsoft. I've been thru all of their help garbage, talked to them and Acer, but still stuck in S Mode. its crap. its annoying. I'm not paying Microsoft for every little thing I may want to add to this computer- It doesnt even let you run Microsoft Office with paying for an additional upgrade.  almost $700 to have my privacy constantly invaded and my every movement tracked. ridiculous. stay with your old laptop and just upgrade the hard drive and save yourself 100's of dollars.

  The other reviews do not understate the quality of the webcam - it is horrendous. Much lesser of quality than I would expect for a $1600 2020 laptop.Love the keyboard. I'm a mechanical-keyboard type of person, and while I typically hate low-profiles, I liked the keyboard on this laptop enough that it was the decision-making factor when it came down to a few options. Handles smaller games great, professional looking and would recommend to anyone using it for non-webcam related purposes.Update: Some serious graphical glitches came with this laptop. It's behaving like motherboard failure. Seems like this is a problem with XPS's in general. Returning and not chancing it - I suspected the laptop was a return to begin with, and the packaging was pretty badly damaged when it came (previously ripped open multiple times). I still like the laptop, but I'm replacing it with a unit from the manufacturer.

  I had issues with this laptop from the start including it almost setting my house on fire from how hot it got overnight.  The technicians said this is an out of box issues. Laptop's should not be fire hazard out of box. Do not buy it! Not safe! Customer service is Awful!!!!! All the features seem cool but dealing with Dell is not worth it or your family's safety.

  I received an open box product. It struggled to function with a wireless mouse and keyboard combo via USB hub.  Several times it crashed if I unplugged it and closed the lid.  Also, recently the fingerprint reader and IR camera for face recognition are no longer recognized.  too many issues in the first two weeks to keep.  However, i am very happy with the laptop as a whole and will be ordering from Dell.  I am sorry that Amazon would send an open box of an obviously defective product to a long-time consumer, especially at this price point.Sorry to return. I saw several other reviews about open items. I'll be ordering from Dell.

  I’m not too keen on this. It’s the same computer as the one I bought in 2017 except it’s different. One thing I loathe is that I needed to buy a dongle so I could hook up my monitor, my keyboard, and my mouse. Didn’t have to on the other one. The fingerprint reader is finicky, which is annoying because I keep logging in and getting that error message, but my biggest issue is the keyboard. Idk what they did with it, but it’s not chiclet style like the older model it’s almost too flat for my preference it feels like I’m going to break the keys. And the hinge feels subpar kind of cheap. Just not happy that I paid all the money for this.

  Purchased fully loaded, Dell XPS 13 (11th gen).  Everything as expected EXCEPT the micro SD slot does not allow the micro SD card to eject.  After researching on the web, this has been reported to Dell as a problem on the XPS 13 (9300 series) as early as 2019;  obviously still a problem.Updated 5-May-21:  Never Dell again.  Sent to Dell for repair, Dell said that, as the microSD port on the Motherboard was damaged, and as not covered by BASIC warranty, I had to pay 259 plus tax to get repaired.  I am having them return the laptop, and am investigating how to return to Amazon as ""received as damaged"".

  The good: I like the back lit keyboard, the fast, quiet solid state memory, the long battery life, the big 15.6 screen.  Used as a simple school or business tool it is a perfectly good computer.The not great: The 4gb ram is a limiting factor on this unit.  You cannot ever install additional ram to handle modern software or games, as it has no slots for ram at all. The 4gb ram is simply soldered in to the unit.Be aware of this when making this purchase.On the plus side, You can easily greatly expand on the 128gb solid drive by plugging in an internal m.2 SSD card.  An empty m.2 slot is provided. The speed of this computer is only slow when used for multi tasking with intense business software. Regular use is fine, in fact its pretty snappy with good performance. I did have to disable the windows 10 S mode. Disabling 10S is a built in option, allowing a return to regular windows. 10s would not function with the business software and non microsoft add ons I require. I am now running regular windows 10 with no issues.

   The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you're using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. I'm evaluating my replacement options right now but it seems it's hard to get an unit without this or worse issues.Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works.Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue.Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is really bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google: ""flex to click xps 9500""). BTW the technician visit on update2 was never scheduled and the ETA was moved up twice. If you're picky with touchpads or quality of your purchases don't buy this model. Reducing my review to one star.

  I love everything about this laptop except for the webcam; it is embarrassingly bad. Like...really REALLY bad. A brand new premium laptop in 2020 should have a webcam that at least looks sorta close to 2020 technology. In a world where Zoom calls are the new norm, this webcam simply doesn't cut it. I really hate that I'm considering returning this machine because of a webcam but it's THAT bad.You've been warned.

  This laptop is fantastic, and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.  But let's talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: ""Is this a new product?"".  Given the $2000 price tag, it's only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving.  I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself.For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before.  With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival.  The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place.Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from ""Dell Returns"" located in Lebanon, Tennessee.  So I did some quick investigating.  I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee.  These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns.  Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these ""new unused"" products at a cheaper price tag.  So yes, I believe this product is ""NEW"", but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards.  This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of.For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon.  Now, considering all of these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL!  You are getting Dell's UHD+ touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro.  If you were buying this same laptop configuration off of Dell's official website, it run you close to ~$2500.  On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on a Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly.  The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel.  The display is gorgeous and crisp.  The touchscreen is super responsive.  The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop.  I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having.Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning pretty hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings.  Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks.  I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender.  And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is definitely a fingerprint magnet lol.All in all, this laptop is absolutely stunning.  The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out.

  I was a little nervous reading reviews that stated that computers come used, not working etc. I can confirm that Amazon delivered to me a pristine machine - working perfectly, is new and exactly to the spec Amazon advertised. Very happy with the purchase. I purchased UHD+ Touchscreen 10th gen i7 - the screen is perfect, on par or better than new MacBook Pro that I also use. Overall new XPS 15 is well designed, solid machine with fast processor and outstanding UHD+ screen. I also like that I can upgrade it to 64GB or RAM for about $300 (2933MHz DDR4 CL17 SODIMM Laptop Memory).P.S. For non technical people, please run both Dell updater (lots of drivers / bios updates there) and Windows updates.

  I love everything about this laptop... EXCEPT THE WEBCAM. I bought this to conduct telehealth sessions and this one thing matters more than anything and it's the one truly horrible thing about it. I look blurry, pixelated, and ghost-like. I spent a lot of money on this and now I have to buy a Webcam.

  I had a chromebook for a couple of years because it was cheap.  When I finally got tired of the limitations of that laptop I started searching on-line for the best reasonably priced computer.  I looked at all the big name models  with touch screen and without.  My wife had an ASUS for several years and I was impressed with the features.  When I saw this one with a 17 inch screen, solid state storage, fast processor and windows 10 not 10S I jumped on it.  I bought it for less than $500.  Can't beat that.  Couldn't get a better one cheaper at Costco.

  In the past two months I have purchased and returned a Lenovo (highest volume was maybe HALF of any other computer I've had and boot up was incredibly slow); an HP (despite reload of Windows10 with HP tech giving instructions by phone, still couldn't get laptop to recognize internal DVD drive and I bought it to load music on to) and now I have come to the conclusion I need to return this ASUS. I only kept it this long because I just could not believe I was in this position for a third time... WTF?!!This VivoBook17 crashes at least once a night EVERY NIGHT. I think it has to do with the auto updates. It freezes for as long as 5 minutes and Ctrl/Alt/Del does not work. Maybe I should call ASUS support but I'm so disheartened, I may not waste my time. If something brand new doesn't work properly, do you want to fix it or do you want something that is perfect right out of the box? I returned the Lenovo to Office Depot up the street. I had to pay $40 to return the HP to an Amazon seller who did not provide for free returns. This one was purchased from Amazon so I am hopeful the return will be free.I bought this laptop because I wanted the largest possible screen (17.3) for my heavy-use streaming (Hulu, Netflix, Prime, HBO, etc.). I also wanted to finally load all my music on one of my computers and it might as well be the newest one. This one is going back but here's how I would rate it:Pros: the screen is large enough for good viewing, the color and clarity are sharp and the volume is great. It boots up quickly and I like the large keyboard buttons. I like that the weight is moderate and not too heavy. The appearance is okay, although I like the look of my old (2013) red ASUS better. My old ASUS had TERRIBLE wireless connectivity and I was happy to find this one had no connectivity issues.Cons: I HATE Windows10 and I believe the issues with this computer are due to the OS and not the equipment itself, but I am not a tech expert and I don't care WHY the problem is, I only want a working and reliable laptop with a 17-inch screen. So here I go back to shopping. Don't know if I'll stick with ASUS or try a fourth brand since, apparently, getting a good product has more to do with luck than with brand name or reputation.

  Computer boots fast and operates quickly. Those are pluses. The big negative for me is the battery life. I have had the computer for just about two weeks, and the longest it has stayed on with a full battery is 90 minutes. That's inconvenient when I am in a meeting that lasts more than that time.

  Seems great, everything installed correctly and booted up normally. Bought this laptop for my father who is going to be using it for work after having back surgery.Laptop is nice in size, but the reason I rated it only 2 stars is because there is a mark on the top side of the laptop which makes me believe this is a used model? I’ve never purchased a tech item that is scratched before, and the listing showed new.Pretty disappointed and cannot return due to this taking almost a week to get to me and he needs it for work. Next time I will look somewhere else for a laptop.

  Product description says this has backlighting for the keyboard; it does not. The lettering is difficult-to-impossible to read in any kind of lighting. Looking at the keyboard it is easy to believe it was INTENDED to have backlighting in the original design but someone forgot to include it in the construction. To 'see' the letters, I had to shine a flashlight at an angle to the keyboard. Tech support responded this was not a glitch, the computer doesn't have it. Can't say much about other features as this was a deal-breaker, and I re-boxed it shortly after starting it.

  This has been the absolute worst buying experience that I’ve had in years. I order this on July 27th and it arrives in a timely fashion on the 29th. After three hours of the mildest use possible (loading programs, etc - getting it ready for an editing job), it is dead. Simply plugging the power supply into the laptop will shunt the power supply, forcing the power supply itself to shut down.Dell was and has been utterly useless to talk to. Amazon has been running me around in some recursive “support” loop for 13 hours now. I’ve offered at least five times to hand deliver this defective laptop to the Amazon facility that shipped it, in return for a new non-defective unit. “Support” has been all but supportive. I am going to lose this job over this.If this problem isn’t rectified by the morning of August 4th, I’m going to dispute the charges against my card and let Amazon and Dell bicker over who will come and get this expensive doorstop.

  Update: Returned the laptop. Would constantly overheat and shut off within 15 minutes of moderate gaming. Can't call this a good gaming laptop if the laptop can't property handle the hardware.This laptop has quite an impressive spec sheet for the price, but with some issues within an hour of unboxing, I'm not sure if the laptop will last.The laptop came out of the box without WiFi drivers, so I had to run to the store and grab an ethernet cable to finish setting it up online. After a few programs and Windows updates installed, I restarted the PC and got a Bitlocker recovery screen requiring me to input the key. I thought ""Okay, good thing I went online and signed in with my MS account"" and got all that fixed.After installing two more programs (MS Office and Notepad++), I restarted my PC and got an light error code (power light blinked 7 times white, 2 times amber) and looked it up online, which told me it was some LCD screen failure. After about 15 minutes of just letting it sit there thinking of what I'd have to do, it started up fine and is working without any further issues now. I have no idea how it fixed itself, but somewhere in those 15 minutes it figured out how to turn itself back on I guess.I've had a number of issues in the first 4 hours of having it today, and am a bit afraid of it just not turning on some day with how it's going so far. I'd say it's a good price, but the hardware/software is abnormally horrible for a new PC.  Only other grievance I've noticed so far is how hot it can get on the bottom of the PC. I know it has a dedicated graphics card in it, but coming from my previous PC (the Dell Inspiron 15 5000 5577), it never got too hot to touch & was very quiet.

"Dell Gaming G3 15 3500, 15.6 inch FHD Non-Touch Laptop - Intel Core i7-10750H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6, Windows 10 Home - Black (Latest Model)","$1,299.99",4.0,"
  It's taken me a week or so to fully digest the functionality and pros/cons of this laptop. Overall, if you read the product description (and know anything about electronics) it's pretty straight forward what you're getting. That being said, I feel it's important to outline a few cool features as well as drawbacks you may overlook.Initial Impression: Materially, this is a really solid piece of equipment. Though somewhat heavier than I expected, this is typical with a gaming laptop. The power adapter is massive however, and unnecessarily so. I don't know if this has anything to do with requiring more energy for intense gaming, but it's literally a quarter the size of the laptop itself. The keys are backlit (which can be turned on and off with the press of a button), and there are ports for virtually everything you could imagine. The screen itself is somewhat of a matte texture which is something I'm not used to, but after a few hours of use I appreciated how it prevents glare. As with most laptops, the brightness is adjustable on the keyboard - something to take into consideration when trying to preserve battery life. That being said, startup was a nightmare... but this was due largely in part to my internet being down - an essential requirement to get up and running. I'm very much a ""plug and play"" kind of guy, so you can imagine my frustration when the computer repeatedly froze on a black screen until I was able to get online to download essential updates and software components (all of which should be pre-installed for a device this new). Trying to add a secondary user was equally frustrating as it also needed to re-download many of the same components as my setup, once again freezing repeatedly. Once past all the initial turmoil, everything was a breeze.Extended use: After a full charge, the battery lasted roughly 2.5-3 hours while I browsed the internet and worked on documents. With streaming and game play, the battery life is surprisingly close to the same (roughly 2 hours depending how much multi-tasking you're doing). The dual fan system is incredibly quiet and kept the laptop from heating more than say your average smartphone after prolonged use.Cortana is your virtual assistant (similar to Siri). While she is accessible from your desktop, you can also enable ""Hey Cortana"" in the settings which will allow her to respond to voice commands.Link your phone using the edge app. This allows you to sync browsing history, favorites, and alternate seamlessly between devices (simply by logging into your Microsoft account). It is worth noting the functionality for Apple products is more limited than Android (which allows you to see/sync SMS, MMS, pictures, and video). I have an iPhone, so I cannot personally attest to whether or not the additional Android features actually work, but the information showed up while setting up my device.Game Shift, a function controlled by a button on your keyboard, is said to increase the fan speed to cool the processor, and prioritizes game data over annoying popups or background apps (and updates). Basically, it is supposed to optimize the resources needed during gaming (processor, video card, memory, etc). I attempted to test this function with several games and did not notice a difference or receive the on-screen prompt that it was working. Perhaps I need to update a driver for this? It wouldn't surprise me given the number of essentials I had to install during setup. That being said, the gaming I did was pretty seamless and ran without issues.It's worth mentioning there is no CD/DVD drive. I completely overlooked this prior to ordering, and the vast majority of my software is on discs. This is easily resolvable with an external drive which costs virtually nothing nowadays.The webcam has an indicator light next to it to ensure privacy (so you know when it's on). The resolution is average, but consistent with other laptop cams on the market.Lastly, a few quick notes. As an avid gamer and video editor, I will say one thing I found discouraging is the computer's memory. Though this is something easily resolved with an external drive, all of these ""plug in"" devices begin to defeat the purpose and simplicity of a laptop. Additionally, the included manual indicates a fingerprint reader on/by the power button... this is NOT a standard feature with all G3 models.Summary: When utilized for office use (or basic functionality) this laptop is superior in terms of speed and software capabilities. For standard gaming it's average, and for the professional gamer it might be underwhelming in some of the areas outlined above. Still, when put to the test it's a reliable laptop that I'd consider a nice addition to Dell's product line.

  I've had the laptop for about a week know and it's been working great. The screen is really good, my previous laptop had a 60hz screen and the difference is definitely noticeable, if it were a bit brighter it'd be perfect.  I've mostly been playing borderlands 3 on it, running the visuals on high. The game runs smoothly, the only catch is that the laptop gets pretty warm. So if you're planning on gaming with this machine I'd definitely recommend a laptop stand.

  Best laptop I have owned.  A lot of tech for the money.  Runs smoothly no matter the task.  Games like Microsoft Flight Sim and Halo run great.  I don’t find that it gets too hot.  Fans spin up, but that is expected.  Beautiful screen.  I had low expectations here, so surprised. Movies look amazing.  Very user upgradable.  I added a second HD (1 TB).  I upgraded to 32G RAM.  Super easy.  Battery life is just ok, but didn’t expect too much from a gaming laptop.  Keyboard and backlight is nice.  Dell software for updates and maintenance is a nice plus.  Alien Software also a nice surprise,.  Laptop is nice just for web browsing, personal/business work and when want to play games it performs.  Highly recommended.  I like the design.  Plenty of ports and I find they are well placed.

  Set it up initially and went through Windows update to make sure I had the latest versions of everything. After about two weeks, Win 10 would say the Bluetooth  hardware was not installed even though it had been working properly.  Tried reloading drivers through Win 10, but it said I had the latest drivers. Eventually tried the Dell support site and downloaded their SupportAssist. It loaded different drivers than the Win 10 ones and that fixed my problem.  Don't understand why the laptop didn't come from Dell with the correct drivers. Also would have saved me a lot of time if the SupportAssist was already on the laptop and available to use.

  Love this laptop.  Had a 8 to 10 year old Dell and when I got this new one I was prepared to take some time to adapt.  Not at all!  Only a few things gave me pause, but overall I went straight into using it as if I had had it for years.  I am 7over 70 so it was a very welcome experience.  I love this laptop and with the addition of a separate disc drive, it is perfect.  It is much lighter than my old one, too which is a big plus. The display is great, and since I do a lot of Zoom, I appreciate the camera quality and the sound.  The storage size is much greater than I will ver use, and since it was such a small increase over the smaller storage, I was really happy to be able to afford it.

  i totally disliked (and the reason for the return) the ""apparent"" need to have an micorsoft account to get the windows 10 that you paid for.  it should have come with windows 10 installed, but no, you have to create a microsoft account to get windows 10, and the computer going.  problem is for me i have been locked out of my microsoft account for 2 months, so this computer will make a really good 3rd base.I now know how to work around it, which i will do with the computer that  i will buy locally, since the on-line tech support for electronics is pretty worthless.  You ask them a question and, can you at least say ""DUH""

  Got this for my wife since she needed a new laptop BADLY, and was starting a new job where she wouldnt have her work laptop for about a month after her start date. This machine is plenty fast, the screen is very good quality and the laptop is thin and light. Everything you would need in a laptop you need for work or travel. My wife absolutely loves the laptop and being the tech nerd husband, I was the one who picked out the options based on specs and she picked out the style/color/size and everything else about it. The Ryzen 7 4700u is the best ultrabook low powered processor on the market, 8 cores 8 threads, and with 16gb of RAM your ready to go in handling all of the normal tasks youd need to with ease. I especially recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a powerful machine, but likes the lightweight and small size convenience to be able to take it with you when traveling no problem.

  It's taking some time getting use to it, since I had a15.6"".  I'm use to having the numbers on the right side of keyboard, big adjustment. Dislike the type c charging cable since it has a round point power port. Have no use for the HDMI port.  Wish it had a Ethernet port instead. Only 2 USB ports, I bet the cable mfg love it selling adapters and docking ports, and adapters. I don't use it for games, and haven't tried touch screen. Over all I like the unit beats the old HHD. Like the flexibility of it make it a tablet. So many things I wish to try.

  It's a good laptop. I was nervous because of the 4 GB and worried it will run slow. I had to download Zoom and had to switch out of S mode....then I realized the computer was running extremely slow.
