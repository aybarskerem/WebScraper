ELECTRONICS,LAPTOPS,5,Acer,positive,"  I had the smaller Acer Chromebook for several years and loved it. It survived a tumble down the stairs, an orange juice bath  and finally succumbed when I dropped it and then stepped on it while on vacation. I bought this laptop based on the performance of the smaller one. The speed is more than adequate and, unlike some computers, is intuitive to operate. This one has dual speakers on the top of the unit which I thought were lousy until I saw that they were covered with a protective plastic layer! For my listening these are more than adequate. The bigger screen is really a plus; when I do a lot of reading I don't have to strain my eyes and it will be more fun to watch a movie.

ELECTRONICS,LAPTOPS,5,Apple,positive,"  UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1.

ELECTRONICS,LAPTOPS,5,MICROSOFT,positive,"  I think the Surface Go is a fantastic device if you don't set your expectations unreasonably high. For reference, I got the 64GB base model, a black type cover, and a Surface pen.After unboxing, setup takes slightly longer than ""just a moment"" as the device likes to say, but if you've already got a Windows 10 device, it's pretty quick and easy. Following the initial startup, the device will need to download a variety of updates, but within 2 hours or so mine was fully up to date after multiple installations, restarts, etc... standard computer update affairs.I switched it out of ""S mode"" almost immediately, because I didn't want to be bootstrapped to the Microsoft store, and it's nice that they give you the option. It doesn't require any restart or anything, and allows you to install apps from anywhere.Regarding performance, I have done email, lots of internet browsing and video watching, movies, drawing, and light photo editing and social networking. The device is not lightning fast and it doesn't need to be. It rarely lags more than a second or 2 to open programs but if you're used to a higher performing desktop or laptop then you will notice. The glossy screen is beautiful and photos and videos look great. There are front firing speakers that sound pretty decent but not much better than your average smartphone speakers, but this is understandable. The device makes zero noise as well, no fans or spinning disks are present here and it rarely gets hot to the touch.Really any light duty thing you would do on a normal Windows 10 PC can be done here. And that's where this thing shines, it's versatility is just head and shoulders above laptops because of how wonderfully portable it is. It feels sturdy, good in the hand or in the lap, and the fully adjustable kickstand is magnificent. In my opinion, the add on keyboard is absolutely essential. It clips on quickly and easily with nice strong magnets. The keys are small and take some getting used to, but having a full keyboard with back-lighting in this form factor is amazing. They are far better than on screen typing. The trackpad is also wonderful, it looks silly large on there but that is a good thing. It's responsive and has a nice clicky feeling.I don't think that the Surface Pen is nearly as essential, but it is fun and works excellent. I could see myself using it for casual note taking, there is virtually no noticeable lag.The charger the device comes with has a proprietary port, but you can also charge it via USB-C, which is great if you have a phone with that port, because you only need one charger while you travel.The only things worth complaining about on this device are made up for by its sturdy build and excellent functionality. It makes a fantastic bridge between the smartphone and PC, perfect for when a smartphone just isn't enough and a full size PC is too much. You don't even need to stow it during takeoff and landing on planes!!! So, set your expectations to a realistic level and the Surface Go, even the base model, will meet them.As an added bonus personally, the Surface Go has helped me use my smartphone less, to the point that I removed most social media from my phone. When you don't have Facebook and Instagram in your pocket at all times, it is pretty amazing how quickly you realize how often you used to mindlessly scroll through your feeds. So you could say it has made me more mindful of my screen time and helped me leave both it and my phone in my pocket or out of reach more often, which we could all use a break from now and then.One more thing... this one is just a tip. Don't buy office! This device has a small enough screen that it qualifies for the free version of MS Office Mobile. Search online for how to get them!UPDATE 2/4/19: I've owned this for several months now and have had zero issues.

ELECTRONICS,LAPTOPS,4,Dell,positive,"  I wanted to enter the world of chromebooks, since so many of my students have them (but almost always forget to bring them to tutor sessions). I didn't want to invest a lot of money as I already have a nice desktop PC and a small tablet for entertainment streaming. I also have a nice Dell 11.6 Windows laptop 2 in 1, purchased 4 years ago for tutor use, but it is noticeably slow as Windows is always pokey to load, or chooses to update when I wake the thing, or has to wind through a virus protector, THEN load Chrome with Google docs or slides (even on a desktop shortcut).

ELECTRONICS,LAPTOPS,3,Dell,positive,"  Just unboxed this little ditty nd completed the initial set up once I got connected to the internet. That process took less time than it took to open the boxes! First critique is that there is no charging light or indicator - that would be useful so I would know if the Unit was operating or even charging. A backlight to the power ON key would have been useful in a similar vein. It's weight and size is perfect for what I wanted and the touch screen is quite nice and reactive. The keyboard is not quite as springy as I am used to but given the laptop's size and weight that can be forgiven. I wanted something light and portable and I have definitely found that. The most major critique I have however is that contrary to what was advertised on this site - this particular device comes with Windows 10S and NOT Windows. Of course this was only discovered when I tried to make the switch to the much preferred Chrome Browser as opposed to WIndows Edge.

A backlight to the power ON key would have been useful in a similar vein.
It's weight and size is perfect for what I wanted and the touch screen is quite nice and reactive.
The keyboard is not quite as springy as I am used to but given the laptop's size and weight that can be forgiven.
I wanted something light and portable and I have definitely found that.

That process took less time than it took to open the boxes!
The most major critique I have however is that contrary to what was advertised on this site - this particular device comes with Windows 10S and NOT Windows.
Of course this was only discovered when I tried to make the switch to the much preferred Chrome Browser as opposed to WIndows Edge.
I feel somewhat hoodwinked by the seller!

They were not that much more so the extra cost would be worth the extra life.",But I used them none the same.,"  Tbh I was skeptical of these from the beginning with the way they were packaged when they came and the fact that they were bone dry (which does not necessarily mean they are bad).

TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,General,3,Command,positive,"  I suppose these would work in a 100% dry environment, but I got these to hang some very lightweight things on the walls in my bathroom (a showercap, headband, and a small handheld mirror). The walls in there are the same as the walls in my room, with the same type of paint on them etc. However this is my bathroom I use every day, and when the shower is used obvi there is going to be steam in the room, like in any normal bathroom when someone takes a shower. I put up one, left it to settle for 24hrs as per the instructions, and then hung the small mirror on it, probably weighing less than 1lbs, and the package for the hooks say it holds 2lbs. It stayed up and stayed put just fine, no issue (yet). I then put up another one in a different location in the bathroom, but still on same type of wall. I left it to settle, but then heard it fall not five mins later. I went and put it back up with a new sticky tab, and same thing happened, so I gave up on that one. Took a shower today for the first time since hanging up the first hook with the mirror, and maybe 20min after my shower I've just heard that one fall too...luckily the mirror is both cheap and sturdy...I think even the mirror part is made of plastic lol, and I didn't hear it break, so I'm sure it's fine.

TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,General,3,Flux Phenom,positive,"  Last Spring I purchased a magnetic screen for my  96"" by 36"" patio door.  It was easy to install; basically just adhering the Velcro tape and using a several tacks to reinforce it. A few months later we hired a painter to paint and refinish all exterior doors. This required taking down the Velcro tape holding up the screen door. I ordered the 20 feet new installation kit to reinstall my screen door. It was fine except IT WAS ONLY 17 FEET, not the 20 feet it was supposed to be. I needed a total of 19.5 feet for my installation. I literally had to salvage several small pieces of the old Velcro tape to make it 19.5 linear feet that I needed to reinstall my magnetic screen door. The kit itself was fine if it had actually contained 20 feet, rather than 17 feet.

TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,General,2,Brita,negative,"  I was a little skeptical when I saw the picture of these on Amazon, because the top of these filters slightly vary to the original filter that came with the pitcher, but as the product states that it is a replacement for Brita pitchers, I thought this would work just as well (I think the incompatibility exception was only in relation to a more specialized pitcher unit, which I don't have). However, as others customers have noted, the filter does not have a sealed/tight fit at all. In fact, if the pitcher is filled to 3/4 or more full, the water displaces the filter, so that it actually rises out of the slot. In addition, I am suspicious of the fact that the water filters a lot quicker than the original filter. End result is that it is a pain. I wouldn't buy these again.",394,157,229,"  I was a little skeptical when I saw the picture of these on Amazon, because the top of these filters slightly vary to the original filter that came with the pitcher, but as the product states that it is a replacement for Brita pitchers, I thought this would work just as well (I think the incompatibility exception was only in relation to a more specialized pitcher unit, which I don't have).","In fact, if the pitcher is filled to 3/4 or more full, the water displaces the filter, so that it actually rises out of the slot.

TOOLS & HOME IMPROVEMENT,General,1,Command,negative,"  I purchased a massive amount of different types of command strips in the first part of 2019.  We were painting the inside of our old house to sell it.  I wanted to put things back up on the wall so there were no holes when I took them down.We moved to our new house in July 2019.  I used Command Strips on almost everything that went on the wall except for the very heaviest things.  My walls have a texture but it is mostly flat so I did my best to make sure the Strips were placed where they would have a flat surface.  I also wiped down the walls with alcohol per the instructions.  3M says they are only for use on flat surfaces.  Good grief!  Where does any house have a completely flat surface other than on cabinets?Anyway, I overestimated the weight of everything and used bigger Command Strips and put a Strip on every corner of everything, except for the hooks.  In October 2020 my things began falling off the walls.  I wrote to 3M and, basically, it was my fault for using them on textured walls.  I proceeded to screw and nail up my wall decor.
