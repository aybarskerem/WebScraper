After trying numerous different brands I can confidently tell you that this one is a definite winner!! It's super soft and comfortable for all day wear. I wear it to work and it doesn't interfere with my typing and paperwork at all.These gloves provide me with the perfect compression in my fingers so I finally have some pain relief when I wear them. I was so excited with this find, I make sure to share this big secret with all my family, friends, and acquaintances that might benefit from it. My cousin doesn't stop thanking me, she says these gloves changed her whole life. I totally believe her.The quality is top grade. I am constantly washing it and drying it, and by just looking at the gloves you would think it's brand new. I am going to place an order right now for an additional pair so I can switch off between the two at night.I recommend these highly and I will continue to do so. I hope with this I can bring relief to soo many people that are desperately looking for it.Don't hesitate! Buy your pair right now!!!",
