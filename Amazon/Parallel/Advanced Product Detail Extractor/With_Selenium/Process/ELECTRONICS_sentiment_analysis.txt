SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using \"swap memory\" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12\" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive \"Pro Apps\" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball \"not responding\" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.",

For reference, I got the 64GB base model, a black type cover, and a Surface pen.After unboxing, setup takes slightly longer than \"just a moment\" as the device likes to say, but if you've already got a Windows 10 device, it's pretty quick and easy. Following the initial startup, the device will need to download a variety of updates, but within 2 hours or so mine was fully up to date after multiple installations, restarts, etc... standard computer update affairs.I switched it out of \"S mode\" almost immediately, because I didn't want to be bootstrapped to the Microsoft store, and it's nice that they give you the option. It doesn't require any restart or anything, and allows you to install apps from anywhere.Regarding performance, I have done email, lots of internet browsing and video watching, movies, drawing, and light photo editing and social networking. The device is not lightning fast and it doesn't need to be. It rarely lags more than a second or 2 to open programs but if you're used to a higher performing desktop or laptop then you will notice. The glossy screen is beautiful and photos and videos look great. There are front firing speakers that sound pretty decent but not much better than your average smartphone speakers, but this is understandable. The device makes zero noise as well, no fans or spinning disks are present here and it rarely gets hot to the touch.Really any light duty thing you would do on a normal Windows 10 PC can be done here. And that's where this thing shines, it's versatility is just head and shoulders above laptops because of how wonderfully portable it is. It feels sturdy, good in the hand or in the lap, and the fully adjustable kickstand is magnificent. In my opinion, the add on keyboard is absolutely essential. It clips on quickly and easily with nice strong magnets. The keys are small and take some getting used to, but having a full keyboard with back-lighting in this form factor is amazing. They are far better than on screen typing. The trackpad is also wonderful, it looks silly large on there but that is a good thing. It's responsive and has a nice clicky feeling.I don't think that the Surface Pen is nearly as essential, but it is fun and works excellent. I could see myself using it for casual note taking, there is virtually no noticeable lag.The charger the device comes with has a proprietary port, but you can also charge it via USB-C, which is great if you have a phone with that port, because you only need one charger while you travel.The only things worth complaining about on this device are made up for by its sturdy build and excellent functionality. It makes a fantastic bridge between the smartphone and PC, perfect for when a smartphone just isn't enough and a full size PC is too much. You don't even need to stow it during takeoff and landing on planes!!! So, set your expectations to a realistic level and the Surface Go, even the base model, will meet them.As an added bonus personally, the Surface Go has helped me use my smartphone less, to the point that I removed most social media from my phone. When you don't have Facebook and Instagram in your pocket at all times, it is pretty amazing how quickly you realize how often you used to mindlessly scroll through your feeds. So you could say it has made me more mindful of my screen time and helped me leave both it and my phone in my pocket or out of reach more often, which we could all use a break from now and then.One more thing... this one is just a tip. Don't buy office! This device has a small enough screen that it qualifies for the free version of MS Office Mobile. Search online for how to get them!UPDATE 2/4/19: I've owned this for several months now and have had zero issues. Changing out of S mode and installing Chrome and other non-Windows store programs has been no problem, no noticeable impact to memory usage or performance. Battery life is still good, just a great little device to have.",

I went thru the variety of Windows 10 laptops & suddenly realized that Chromebook is a laptop as well, but more limited on what it can do compared to a Windows or Apple laptop. So I got this Acer Chromebook CB3-532 as my first Chromebook. Very nice looking laptop with a 15.6 inch screen, fairly easy to set up with a fairly good picture quality. It has a built-in webcam with mic, SD card reader, 1 USB 3.0 port & 1 USB 2.0 port plus HDMI port. It has 2 gigabytes of memory, 16 drive & headphone/speaker jack.  It does not however have a CD/DVD player/burner.  I attached an external mouse to use on this Chromebook....it works just fine. Laptop seems slightly sluggish but not a major issue for me....yet.  I have had this Acer Chromebook for a month now & still a learning curve as I have been using Windows laptops for over 12 years now......so indeed a big learning curve for me. It has wifi connectivity & you cannot hard wire into the Internet with this Chromebook, just by wifi....which is fine for me.There are no real icons on the desktop of Chromebook. Whatever I used on my Windows 7 laptop & had desktop icons....I simply will have to funnel it through Chrome browser already on this laptop. Battery life seems good at currently 7 hour life on a full charge and for the most part, this nifty Chromebook should do fine for me . 4 stars I give this interesting Chromebook mostly because it's a new thing for me to learn, but similar to my Android Smartphone....so not too bad, no desktop icons like a Android smartphone however. Needless to say, a learning experience for me with this Chromebook...keyboard a bit lacking features compared to a Windows/Apple keyboard.

              "Content": "  I wanted to enter the world of chromebooks, since so many of my students have them (but almost always forget to bring them to tutor sessions). I didn't want to invest a lot of money as I already have a nice desktop PC and a small tablet for entertainment streaming. I also have a nice Dell 11.6 Windows laptop 2 in 1, purchased 4 years ago for tutor use, but it is noticeably slow as Windows is always pokey to load, or chooses to update when I wake the thing, or has to wind through a virus protector, THEN load Chrome with Google docs or slides (even on a desktop shortcut).  That's not so fun when you've got a room full of high schoolers looking for an excuse to get distracted. So I was intrigued by those ads that showed the speed and ease of chromebook for Goggle Docs and Slides. To test my theory, one student and I had a loading race with their chromebook and my older windows 10 Dell (updated, memory cleaned, debugged...so lean and mean as its going to get), and hands down, the chromebook left my old Dell Inspiron 3000 windows 10 in the dust.That brought me to Amazon and this chromebook.This Dell N3481 (as it says on the box) chromebook 11, NON TOUCHSCREEN, is an excellent economical student chromebook which is why I gave it 4 stars. It is a nice back pack size, overall sturdy (though the screen-lid feels like it bends a little which is a bit disturbing but probably harmless), from sleep loads to chrome menu incredibly fast, then opens Google docs or slides incredibly fast, plus has a long life battery. Don't expect to run your favorite Windows programs as this is not that kind of computer. It is a glorified Android (chrome) tablet with nice touch dedicated keyboard for those who are tired of typing with their thumbs for longer composition essays in the Google doc/slide or mobile app formats. So for a student notebook, it is excellent and an extremely good buy at the price of about $160 new (at this time).What it is not: It is not for a professional tutoring business where 2 students, or a small group club, have to look at the same screen at angles. This is NOT IPS nor is it in any way multidirectional. The description where it says it can lay flat to view is an exaggeration at best, misleading in truth. The moment you leave dead center, with an otherwise decent to good quality screen that is bright and sharp enough for Netflix surfing and definitely any browsing or document work, you enter the world of shadows and rank invisibility. That won't make a a bit of difference if you are a single student using your computer to sit at your desk to do homework. It DOES make a BIG difference if you need to be able to view it at off angles.  In order to do that, upgrade to the Dell touchscreen model which includes IPS technology so that the screen is bright and sharp at all angles...flat, tented, side by side two people, small club, etc.The sound is decent to good for one student, and loud enough to listen to over a newer dishwasher while you video watch while cooking. It is tinny and somewhat indistinguishable if you put it up to full so that a group can listen to the video. Buying a reasonably inexpensive USB speaker will clean that up (which I had on hand for proof).And yet...I returned it. The deal breaker was lack of screen angle for my purposes.I love the chrome environment as it fits my tutor needs. If this were for my child to go to high school or even college....I would have been happy. However for what I need in my tutoring business and club coaching, I have returned it to upgrade to the Dell Inspiron Chromebook 11, 2 in 1, touchscreen.  It will be like my old Dell windows 2 in 1 just without the clunky windows 10 bogging down efforts to get to Google work.",

Twice I ordered one of the HP 11 Chromebooks, at first the earlier G4 model, and twice I received the incorrect model.  In each case, the packaging had been mislabeled, either by HP or an HP refurbisher/reseller. In the meantime the price kept going up.  I then tried to order the newer and less expensive (!) HP 11 G5.  Amazon offers it new at a serious discount to Prime members.  Sounded good except Amazon was indicating a 3-4 week delivery time.  I finally reordered a \"like new\" G5, received it in 2 days, and am quite happy.  Anyone who orders one of these fabulous Chromebooks should be aware of the significant differences between the G4 And G5 models and should check to be sure he or she receives what was ordered, including the amount of installed memory.  The differences between the G4 and G5 include:The G4 has a slightly faster CPU.The G5 CPU is a more energy efficient processor.The G5 has a redesigned battery.Because of the last two differences, the G5 has a 9-12 hour battery capacity compared to 5-8 hours for the G4.The G5 has a microSD slot; the G4 has a full size SD slot.The G5 has 2 USB3 ports; the G4 has 1 USB2 and 1 USB3 port (I think).The G5 now runs Android apps offered through Google Play.  The G4 does not have this capability.The last capability really sold me on the G5.  I can now play all my Amazon Audible books on this Chromebook, which I couldn't do on my older Chromebooks.  My less versatile Fire tablet is quickly becoming obsolete for my uses.  By the way, Google Play comes up as a pre-installed app on the G5 and is a gateway to many more apps, which I have yet to explore.  I also own an older HP Chromebook 14.  Both the G4 and G5 are significantly lighter and more portable than the HP Chromebook 14 and have no moving parts (no fan, completely noiseless).To be clear, older Chromebooks also have Google Play installed but have limited or no ability to run Android apps.  My Chromebook is running Chrome version 60.0.3112.80.  In the system details (chrome://system) is the additional line \"CHROMEOS_ARC_ANDROID_SDK_VERSION 23\".

From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.• It's a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.• It's light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won't feel worried that you're not going to bend it.• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I'm learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it's placed on my lap.• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you're planning to edit videos on this.• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don't expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it's quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can't be ignored in 2019. It's very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it'll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn't great. I'm getting around 8 hours of power. That's having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it's nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don't take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn't test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we're already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn't for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you're going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It's disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you're pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can't attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can't tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I'm also irritated that Microsoft didn't at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you'll know that Microsoft put all their money on what's inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that's the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I'm always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can't do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you're getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer",

I have had it for a few weeks now and I don't miss my Windows laptop one single bit.  I was worried that my laptop had features with which a Chromebook could not compete.  I haven't come across any.Chromebooks do not come with optical drives or a hard drive with a ton of space.  You also can't load third party software such as MS Office or TurboTax.  There simply isn't the space or computing power to do so, not to mention the OS to support it.Chromebooks do come with the Chrome OS, browser and the ability to download apps from Google Play.  Onboard storage is limited to 16 - 64 GB but Chrome is fully integrated with Google Drive (unlimited storage) and you can easily use an SD card or a thumb drive so you can access files offline.  They also have considerably more battery time than a conventional laptop.  You can easily use the online version of MS Office if your account is associated with a licensed copy of MS Office or you can subscribe to Office 365 and most software applications you would use (e.g. Turbotax) have web-based versions as well.Anyway, back to the review of the ASUS C523.  Its a great device.  The C523 has a full 15.6 inch display so it \"looks\" like any full size laptop.  It is fully integrated with all of my Google resources...mail, Google Drive, Youtube and I can access content from Netflix via the Chrome browser or the app.  I can store files locally if I want but I usually just save them to Google Drive.  Its very portable and light so I can move with as easily as a spiral notebook.  The thing that really wows me is that it is \"instant on\".  I don't have to wait for some convoluted boot process...I open the lid, type my PIN and I am in with no delay.  Updates are done in the background and I have not had to do a reboot yet because of one.  It intefrated with my (wireless) printer in a snap...I have not tried USB connecting the printer so I don't know if that would work.The only negative thing I have to say is regarding battery life.  ASUS says you can get up to 10 hours of battery life.  That is not true.  There is nothing that you can do on this device that is economical enough to get you to 10 hours of battery life.  I would say you can count on about 5 hours MAX if you are just surfing the internet or watching Netflix and the display brightness is kept as low as possible.

First critique is that there is no charging light or indicator - that would be useful so I would know if the Unit was operating or even charging. A backlight to the power ON key would have been useful in a similar vein. It's weight and size is perfect for what I wanted and the touch screen is quite nice and reactive. The keyboard is not quite as springy as I am used to but given the laptop's size and weight that can be forgiven. I wanted something light and portable and I have definitely found that. The most major critique I have however is that contrary to what was advertised on this site - this particular device comes with Windows 10S and NOT Windows. Of course this was only discovered when I tried to make the switch to the much preferred Chrome Browser as opposed to WIndows Edge. I mean they did try to hard sell the Edge browser during set up, but I would much rather prefer Chrome due to it's user friendliness and accessibility across my devices. I feel somewhat hoodwinked by the seller! So now to consult You Tube and Google on how to switch out of S Mode and go about my business. With some more usage I may update this review.",

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.",
