It was a small but painful blister and after I put one of these pads on I completely forgot about it until 3 days later when it started to fall off. I was SHOCKED at the amount of gross junk it pulled out of such a small blister, I was mildly disgusted. I was surprised that I walked almost 20 miles for the 3 days I had this thing on and never felt a thing. It healed amazingly quick and will always keep these on hand.",

You can use it in the shower, pool or expose it to rain or water and it will stay glued together and not peel off like others. It has sufficient width and the band is big enough to cover big cuts or large wounds. The adhesive will make it hold to the skin for as long as you need it, even longer. The adhesive may irritate tender skin a little if you try to remove it in a hurry, but if you remove it gently, it will be just fine. I will go for this any day.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to use it if they don't intend on wearing the bandaids for at least 24 hours. I personally use them for body pimples, zits, and boils - that way I can forget I even have the bandaids on and it'll start peeling when it's ready to come off.

I have since used them for a cut on the tip of my finger. This time I couldn't, and didn't, overlap. All of the adhesive part of the band aid is on skin. And it sticks wonderfully.

All in all, a very decent basic first aid kit at a reasonable price. There is more than enough space in this box to add extras if you want them.Cons - Not many, for what it is - a BASIC first aid kit. This will help you if you are home or camping/vacationing and get any number of small cuts/scrapes/stings etc. I like having a pair of tweezers, a pair of scissors, a small tube of aloe vera, a small spray bottle of hand sanitizer, a few folded paper towels in a sandwich bag, a small pocket knife, a tube of lip balm, and a 5 foot length of paracord with a carabineer in my kit, so I add them. Those are just my preferences. Not really cons I guess. Maybe you have other preferences/needs...*Useful tip for saving space in your first aid kit.* Get rid of the unnecessary boxes. A quart-sized zip top bag will hold all of your bandages and gauze. The tubes have all the \"medical facts\" and usage information printed on the tube.

Unfortunately for me, I get a lot of cuts on my hands. Don't ask me why, I work on a computer for a living. But I do my own auto and home repairs and get my share, and then some, of cuts on my fingers and knuckles, so having a good supply of band aids is kind of a necessity. I have big hands so the 1\" x 3-1/4\" is a perfect size. I have a mixed pack as well, but the majority of the time this is the size and shape I need so it made sense to get a one size box.The stretch fabric allows you to make them work pretty much wherever you might have a cut - and they stay put, even if it's on a knuckle joint that moves. And since they are a thicker material it's much easier to find the edge to remove one. And if you put one on too tight, you can easily find the edge, loosen it up, reapply it and it will still stay stuck. No joke.Now if you're looking for a water proof band aid this might not be a good fit. They are pretty absorbent actually. But for me that is not an issue. If it gets wet I just grab another one. The waterproof band aids don't have the flexibility these do and don't stay on, so it's not a good trade off in my opinion.Can't go wrong with these band aids and you get a lot for the money.",

After looking for solutions for almost a dozen of years, I can't believe it took me this long to get these.I have been suffering from arthritis for almost 20 years now. In the beginning it was just a little soreness in my fingers and my knees, but with time the symptoms increased and multiplied by leaps and bounds. I began experiencing intermittent pain in the joints, ankle, back, fingers, hands, muscles, neck, and wrist. The pain in the fingers and hands were the worst. They really impacted my day to day life more than anything else.I was becoming handicapped. It was horrible to become so dependent on others at such a young age. In my younger years I have been a court stenographer. As soon as the arthritis symptoms appeared I was forced to give it up. I tried other small jobs over the years, but arthritis ripped me away from the occupation that suited me most.My Dr. referred me to a Rheumatologist who suggested the following:* Hydrotherapy* Stretching* Massages* AcupunctureAnd many more diverse ideas. Some were more soothing and some were less, but that's all they were. Soothing. During the hydrotherapy I blessed the instructor.i haven't felt so good in years! But that relief was short lived, as it only lasted for a short while, and later that day I was back to square one.My wife and 3 children were all very worried about me. They didn't stop suggesting different remedies they have head about:* physical exercise * Weight loss* Heating pad* Ice packs* Cold compressesAnd I tried. I really did. I went through each of them. When it didn't work I gave it another chance and another chance. I was sooo desperate! I am big believer of natural, and therefore I didn't try any medications. I don't believe any of them would have helped anyways!I was beginning to give up hope. I thought I was done for life, since any daily chore became so difficult. I didn't like depending on others and being a burden on them.Then a miracle happened. My daughter bought me a pair of ComfyBrace arthritis gloves as a gift for Christmas. I was really skeptical. After nothing helped, why would this be different? Well, you gotta believe it. I was so desperate that I was willing to try anything, and try it I did. It only took a few hours for the gloves to begin their magic. The size large fits me comfortably. (How did my sweet daughter know exactly what size to get? God bless her!) It has the perfect balance. The compression is great, but it's not painful. I wouldn't say it happened over night, but in a very short time I was doing things again that were very difficult for me a mere 2 days ago. I did not become young again, and I will not be a court stenographer ever again, butat least I got my independence back. I am still looking for a solution to all the other pains, perhaps someone has a solution for that??I ordered another pair, so I can wear it when the other one is in the wash. I couldn't wait until it dries to put it back on, a second pair was crucial.So far I have been highly satisfied, and I'm extremely thankful for this amazing creation.I have been wearing it for only a couple of weeks now, I will definitely update my review in a few weeks to let you know how it has been going!I highly recommend that everyone tries this!

It probably all began because I work for a commercial designing company, and I spend about 8-10 hours a day doing 3D rendering on the computer, which entails a lot of using the keypad and mouse. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with tingling in my hands and sometimes with severe pain. I spent many restless nights twisting and turning in bed.I was advised by my Dr. to try wearing a night brace, and desperate to find a solution to the endless pain I stopped into my local pharmacy to pick up a handbrace from a big brand. I wore it for a few weeks and didn't see any difference, the pain at night was still severe and sleeping at night was almost a thing of the past. Nothing was working until I bought this comfybrace.After using this brace for one night I realized this was really making a big difference. I right away saw major improvement. After months of not being able to sleep at night I started getting a couple of hours of shut eye in a row!! This was a major breakthrough for me. Now that i'm wearing it for two weeks, night pain is a thing of the past. I thought surgery was my only solution, but maybe this is an easier solution!!!This comfybrace is made of durable material which makes it very soft yet sturdy and therefore my hands weren't sweaty from it. Another thing which was very important to me was the super soft and comfortable cushioning beads by the palm. The beads are soft enough that they got molded to the shape of my hand and hold my hand perfectly in that position.My hands are pretty average size for a man, and this glove fits me perfectly!! This brace is really adjustable so it would probably fit most hand sizes, including pretty slim hands and husky ones too.This brace is also made of very high quality materials and is stitched together very strongly. I can see that this will really last me a while. You can also see the picture I have attached showing the high quality stitching.I highly recommend this brace, and it's definitely worth the money. It's not worth  wasting nights when there is such an easy and affordable solution available.Thank you so much Comfy Brace!!!",

I slept all night that first night and most other nights since using it. While I know a brace wont eliminate the problem completely, I recommend this brace for anyone dealing with this painful and annoying issue especially during flare ups of the condition and symptoms. I am getting another just to have for travel as I am very impressed with this product.

Another gave firmer support but was so uncomfortable that I removed in in my sleep (yeah, lifelong sleepwalker here).So then I tried the Comfy Brace. I was a little dubious since it does not come in a right or left hand version, the brace will fit either hand which I thought might mean it would not fit well. I was sooo wrong.Wowza, it works a charm! The three straps provide a more customisable fit so it can be firm enough to discourage the twist but still comfortable enough that I leave it on in my sleep. The cushion full of beads is brilliant--I put it on, wiggle my fingers once or twice, the beads shift into position and I honestly can't feel the metal support (part of the problem with the uncomfortable brace was that the end of the metal support tended to dig into my palm).It has definitely helped my wrist and hand without being uncomfortable at all. It fits like it was made specifically for my hand. Either hand! I've only used it for a couple months, so I don't know yet how it will last (still feels like new). If I ever wear it out, I'll buy another. No more experimenting, this is definitely the perfect design for me.",

I dislike the sporty, athletic, look of the rubber wristband that comes with the Fitbit Charge 2, especially when dressing for work, so I was looking for an alternative. This is a great choice if you want your Fitbit to look less like a piece of sports equipment and more like a stylish watch.The band is nothing fancy. Rather than one thick piece of leather, the construction of the band is almost like a thin leather veneer wrapped around some kind of core material for structure. (I think the core might be made from leather as well, because the band flexes like leather more than like rubber, but I'm not cutting mine open to find out for sure.) You can see the layers in the detail shots of the band. If you're looking for something that resembles a high-dollar leather watchband, you'd be better served looking at the designer lines that have done collaborations with Fitbit, but for $60 (or less from third party sellers) this is a good value.The construction quality of the band seems durable, and is very comfortable. I've been wearing mine every day, and sleeping in it (taking it off only to shower, or to switch back to a rubber band for higher intensity exercise) for about a month. It's a genuine Fitbit accessory, so it attaches securely, snugly, and easily to the device, as you would expect. I like that the edge of the band lies perfectly flush with the watch face for a seamless look.All in all, a good band to change the look of your Fitbit. It looks nice and feels like it will last.",

When the package arrived, I was convinced I was sent the wrong item - the Navy is almost indistinguishable from Black.  I had to hold it next to something black and something navy to be sure.  If you want a blue band, I would look elsewhere as this is Navy black.On the upside the Orange is a slightly muted version of what is displayed on screen and I actually love it.  That was a nice suprise because I was questioning if would ever wear a neon orange band.  It's not neon orange and will be great with summer clothing.The set comes with only one clasp - not one for each band.  The other two bands are held in place for packaging with clear plastic tabs.  I would not try to use these plastic tabs to secure the band for normal wear.  Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase... I needed a few additional colors to coordinate better with my clothing given my arms are now exposed in warmer weather.  This does the trick ...at a fair price.",

I thought this was the fix for the fitbit Ionic errors in heart rate detection and also the times of non-detection and it did that for a few days and then the watch went back to having errors in reading heart rate by as much as at least 75bpm to not reading at all where it just displays two dashes -- or back to errors again. The fit of this is very nice, it allows the watch to be flat against your wrist without tightening it as much as the standard bands. And I really like the look of it, sweating less in it too. Personally I have heard a lot of people having trouble with other brands than fitbit tearing, but I can't say if this fitbit branded one is better or not because I have officially given up and retired the watch and am on to a new fitwatch.

The part to tuck in the strap is also better, strap doesn't come out as often if your kid had that issue- Better screen - the animations and display look better- Longer battery life. It is now 8 days instead of 6, and the battery noticeably lasts much longer- New animated faces (a few), with apparently Minion licensed content and straps coming soon- No more one button on the left. Both left and right side have these two touch sensors which can be used for going back to the menu or activating the water lock- Waterproofing has been improved to a depth of 50m, but if your kid is going for a swim, they'll have to turn on the water lock (long press of both sensors, and then double tap screen when it asks you to)- Still connects seamlessly with the Fitbit app and kids view mode etc.- BIGGEST UPGRADE: Fitbit has since the last 2-3 years moved to bad charging connectors in my opinion, the old Alta 2 ones were the best. The Ace 2 and Inspire use magnetic chargers made of plastic but they don't hold well. With the Ace 3, they've added two clips that hold the charger in place. Not sure if other new fitbit chargers have this, but this is a big upgrade from the old Ace 2 charger which was not easy to hold in placeAll in all, neat upgrades to the best kids tracker out there, at the same price point as before!",

            "Content": "  Update 12/8/15 - Fitbit just added a new firmware update for the sleep timer feature. Once updated it's no longer necessary to tap the Fitbit before going to sleep or when waking it. It will now recognize when you're inactive and have gone to sleep. It also has some new goal setting software in the app relating to sleep to make it easier to focus on getting more (or less) sleep. The graphic interface is pretty nice. I'm looking forward to using this since I've become something of a night owl and could really stand to get on a better schedule. One more thing to like about my Fitbit.The update took about 5 minutes using my iPad and plugging my Fitbit into its charger while it updated. The whole thing was simple. A red arrow on the dashboard, in the sync area alerted me to the upgrade. I really like this new feature.I  bought 3 of these fitbit flex devices, one for myself, my husband and my sister. Before purchasing I researched several wristband devices such as the Jawbone UP, the Nike Fuel and and the Polar Loop. I also looked at the fitbit force which is a newer version of this band. The lack of water resistance on the force was a deal breaker for me. I wanted to be able to wear this band 24/7 and to be able to wear it in the shower or when swimming. That was part of what made it attractive to me. Also, after reading reviews about the clasp problems on the force and how many people lost them, I wanted no part of that. They are also quite a bit bigger and look clunckier.  The wristband on the UP looked like it would catch on everything and had no display at all. The Polar had lots of quality problems. I wasn't crazy about the looks of the Nike. The display is nice and I can see how people would like them, but not my style. The fitbit flex, to my tastes, had the coolest look. I also know a couple of people who own the fitbit flex and they were very enthusiastic about them so that influenced me as well.So here is what I like about the flex: I like the way it looks on my wrist. All of us got the slate color. You can also order bands in a few different colors, both here and on the Fitbit site.  It is lightweight and even though I don't often wear a watch I don't notice this on my wrist at all. The clasp was VERY difficult to secure the first couple of times until the rubber softened up a bit and until I got the hang of it. I secured it off of my wrist a couple times when it was new. Making sure the band and clasps are lined up correctly and then placing one finger directly below the clasp and my thumb directly above and squeezing hard was the way to do it.I like that it's water resistant and that I can wear it swimming or in the shower. It is safe down to 10 meters or around 30 feet. I like that the wristband is made of TPU rubber, which according to Wikipedia is a type of rubber used in automotive instrument panels, caster wheels, power tools, sporting goods, medical devices, drive belts, footwear, inflatable rafts, and a variety of extruded film, sheet and profile applications. I think it should hold up for a very long time. I like that the display on the band gives me a rough idea by tapping on it of my progress throughout the day. I can also check my progress on my iPhone 4S and see number of steps so far, calories burned, how many hours of sleep I got last night and how often I woke up or was restless. So far it seems very accurate. I can also track the foods I've eaten and the calories, my weight goals and weight lost, check on the weekly number of steps friend's with Fitbits have taken and compare them with my own.I like that I can wear it 24/7 and only have to take it off to charge it once every 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to charge with a USB thingie that comes with it. I use a wall adapter to charge it but could also use a USB port on my desktop or laptop computer. I've lost too many pedometers in the past by dropping them out of my pockets or forgetting about them and sending them through the washing machine, so the wristband seems like a much better option for me. I also like that I can connect wirelessly with my smartphone and with the little dongle included that goes into my desktop or laptop, can connect with those wirelessly as well. Software downloads for all of these are free. I'm also able to connect on my first gen Kindle HD 8.9 although I can't see where it's shown as a supported device so far. But it works with the Android fitbit software in the app store.The step measurements seem reasonably accurate. Waving my hand slowly won't register as a step. Waving wildly will. Driving in the car won't register but reaching around quickly in the car sometimes will. Typing on the computer or Kindle won't register. I've heard that swimming doesn't register either but you can input the time and activity on your phone or tablet.  When I first got the flex I started the iPhone app and watched my steps register on my screen as I walked around the house. That, and watching my steps on the treadmill have shown it to be pretty accurate for me, although not perfect. I think that all pedometers have some inaccuracies. What I'm looking for is a comparative trend where I can tell how much exercise I'm getting. The accuracy is good enough for me.So I wake up in the morning, tap the wristband quickly a few times to tell it I'm awake. Then if I tap it twice I see one tiny blinking light, telling me I'm working on my first 2,000 steps. Later, when I've hit that mark and tap to check again, I'll see one solid light and the second one blinking. There are 5 lights total and each represents 2,000 steps (or 20% of my goal. I could set it up differently on my computer, using a different number of steps as my daily goal if I wanted to.) So I can see my approximate progress any time during the day.  When I hit my goal of 10,000 steps the band vibrates and all the lights flash. That means you done good!I can set up to 8 silent vibrating alarms on this fltbit. I have one to wake me up on weekdays (you can specify which days) and one at 8:00 each night to remind me stop eating for the day. The vibration gets my attention and is effective at waking me up. I set the alarms on my computer or phone.At night when I'm in bed and ready to go to sleep I tap the wristband rapidly a few times, it vibrates briefly, and goes into the sleep mode until I wake it again in the morning.So am I happy that I purchased the Fitbits for myself and my family members? Yes I am. It motivates me to walk or run more. I can connect to other friends and family with Fitbits to see everyone's weekly step progress but what really motivates me is just competing against myself. I'll find myself parking in the back of the parking lots at stores to log those extra steps or walking around the store longer because it's a good way to add even more. When I haven't reached my goal at night, I'll sometimes walk around the house several times just to hit a number. Now that can't be all bad, can it?Update 1/12/14 - I'll keep updating this review with comments and observations as I use this device. I noticed that walking at a rapid pace is counted as \"active minutes\". Someone on a message board suggested adding a touch of lotion to the clasp if you're having trouble getting it to clasp when it's new.Update 1/16/14 - A full charge is lasting just a bit over 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to recharge it fully.Update 1/21/14 - Some people have complained about this band coming undone and losing it. I haven't had any problems with it at all, even when pulling tight coat and shirt sleeves over it, brushing my arm against things or the dog pulling on it once or twice. (I'm sure the dog could have pulled it off if I didn't stop him.) The other day I had the dog's leash wrapped around the wrist with the Fitbit and even with the dog pulling against the leash the fitbit stayed on. We walked this way a couple of miles before I noticed it and unwrapped the leash from my wrist. But even with all that agitation my fitbit stayed put. It has stayed on through enough that I'm not very concerned about losing it. I've only taken it off to charge it. I have the band snug enough that I can only put one finger beneath the band but I can move it a couple of inches back and forth on my wrist.Update 7/3/14 - A new update that works with iPhones that use the Fitbit app was released a few days ago. I've used it with my iPhone 4S and really like the new upgrade. It adds a whole new dimension to my Fitbit app. With the upgrade, I just click on the exercise icon on the dashboard which takes me to a new screen showing the days of the week that I've exercised. (Meaning a walk, run or hike, something in addition to the regular walking in my daily activities.) This screen shows exercise frequency by day of the week, it puts a check on the days that you do some planned exercise. If I click the little stopwatch in the upper right-hand corner, it takes me to a screen where I can click Walk, Run, or Hike. I go back and can then click Cues which takes me to another screen where I can select whether or not I want to hear spoken cues. I can also tell it which cues I want including: Distance, Time, Average Pace, Split Pace, and Calories Burned. Then I go back again an can select the frequency of the cues from every .5 miles to every 5 miles.  Or, I can make the cues time based ranging from every 2 minutes, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 minutes. I can also select the volume of the cues. (Medium was perfect for me.) Then, back again to select a playlist from my iPhone's loaded tunes. Last, I allowed location services for Fitbit in my phone settings and I was ready to go. Now I see a big red circle with a Start arrow on the screen over a GPS map showing my location. I pop in my earphones, click Start and my music starts playing.As I walk, I can see a screen showing how far I've walked, rate per mile, time elapsed. Every half mile a voice interrupts my music telling me how far I've gone and all the other things I've specified in Cues that I wanted to know. Then it goes back to playing my music until it's time for my next designated Cue. How cool is that? It works seamlessly. At the end of my walk I tell it I'm finished (or I could also pause it if I stop to talk to a neighbor or something). When I'm finished (or even during the walk or run) I can see a little red line  showing my route on the map. The steps from my walk are added to my steps count, just as they always are. I love these new features. They add a lot to the Fitbit experience.For those of you who track calories and foods eaten in the Fitbit app, the update now includes a bar code scanner. So far, the things I've scanned have been in their database. If you don't see the bar code symbol in the upper right-hand corner of the Log Food screen, log out of the Fitbit app and then log back in and it should be there.Update 11/28/14 - If something happened to ithis Fitbit today, what would I replace it with? Another one just like it. If one of the new Fitbit models was interchangeable with it on a daily basis I might get one of those too, just because I like new technology. But this one would be my main fitness band. I would like having a watch built in, but then it would look kind of silly wearing a conventional watch on the other arm. And I have a lot of nice watches.Update 12/12/14 - I just noticed today that the Fitbit Flex is the #1 Best Seller on Amazon this holiday season. It does seem like when I see people wearing fitness bracelets, this is the one they're most often wearing. A lot of the competitors have lowered prices significantly on their devices which is probably the best indicator of all. It's nice to know that I'm not the only Fitbit fan after wearing it for nearly a year. :)Update 12/26/14 - My Fitbit looks all new for the holidays. This replacement bracelet took over 20 days to arrive but for about $2 it was worth the wait.",

            "Content": "  I'm really sad that this Inspire 2 is catching so much grief in the reviews here, but what I believe it boils down to is most people only leave bad reviews. If someone is happy with something they usually won't take the time to come on an write about it unless it is beyond brilliant. I wont go so far as to say this fitbit is that, but it is a wonderful gadget and personally I find no truths in what many here are complaining about. Firstly I would like to start with, if comparing to the HR and making a decision between the two, definitely go with the newer model. It does more; like the 24/7 heart rate monitor which is really great to keep an eye on, the active zones and a great battery life. So far I've gone 4 days with no charge and only gotten to 65%, that's incredible to me. Not to mention this new model includes a free year of premium which has a lot of great stuff in it like fitness guides and mediation exercises.When I was making the decision I read pros and cons comparisons and ultimately it was these and the sluggish touch screen on the HR that led me to choose the Inspire 2. I'm glad I did, I have zero regrets. And for some reason this is cheaper right now than the older model! (Edit: it looks like that was  pre holiday sale and it's more expensive now which does make sense, it is better) It's functioning flawlessly. It was a great price, is very easy to use, and really is a good little motivator.I love the gentle alarms, the relax exercises, and the little reminders to drink water and exercise. The sleep tracking is really fascinating and a personal goal of mine to work on, this is a major help to me in that regard. I love that it is swim safe as well, since I'm big on swimming.I have pretty small wrists, and while it sits off of it a bit, it's not overly bulky and is light, and by no means bothersome.Also the recommendation for wearing it is slightly loose, not snug, and I find the best position for it is just above the ulna.As far as people having trouble with it getting stuck on one screen and always showing their weight or constantly buzzing with alerts? That is 100% user error. I will say with confidence if you take your time to sit down and just read through and explore the app with patience, it is all very user friendly. These screens can be backed out of, changed, and alarms/ reminders set or cancelled.There was also a review that mentioned there's no way to view the HR on the main screen, and you have to swipe through 5 times or so to get to it. While that is one way, there is also the quick function on the home screen just below the clock, tapping this will cycle through which to display (HR, calories, active zones, miles, and steps) so you can have your HR and time visible anytime.My two biggest \"issues\" with it which are very minor, would be the band, which tends to irritate the skin slightly with constant wear. Cleaning, switching wrists or bands is a simple solution.The other one is that the steps aren't incredibly accurate, they give a rough idea, but I tend to halve mine based off of my walking routes that I know. This is a broad guess on my part, steps matter least to me but it's probably closer to 75% accurate.Keeping that and the relatively low price in mind, I think this is a wonderful all over health tracker and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality tracker at a reasonable price and healthier lifestyle. It is a small piece of plastic that I find quite incredible at what it is capable of doing for being so tiny, and am amazed at all of the extras in this!",

            "Content": "  I purchased this item from Target. I've owned a handful of fitness trackers in the past, but never one from the Fitbit brand. My Garmin devices (Vivofit 2, Vivosmart HR, Vivofit 3) served me well in terms of functionality, but they never seemed to hold my attention. That is to say, the user interface, while functional and useful, simply was not that...inspiring (excuse the ridiculous pun). It wasn't very fun. I know that's not important to everyone, but the Fitbit app and UI are so much more engaging and easy to use. The Garmin devices I sort of just wore and didn't think much about, but this device and the accompanying app keeps me interested and motivated all day and night long. It's also an all-in-one solution for me, as opposed to using multiple apps to sync all of my info together to create a complete picture that I can use to motivate myself to be better and do better.We all know the accuracy of all fitness trackers is highly debated and, to be honest, I've finally managed to accept that and just keep in mind that the info I'm getting is an approximation. I have found the accuracy to be perfectly acceptable for my needs—it is useful information to work with, regardless of the hyperspecific levels of accuracy of the device. The trends are what matters. The consistency of the device's info from day to day is ultimately more important than the fact that no, this is not a medical-grade device that will nail every piece of info to a T. And that consistency is certainly there. As far as I know, there are no user-friendly, portable, wearable devices out there that can tout perfect accuracy. The human body's mechanisms are far too complex to measure precisely. These trackers are motivational and informational tools. And, for most users, I think this device is perfectly suited to that. It's fun to use, looks streamlined and fairly fashionable (or at least unassuming), and comfortable to wear. It seems to be fairly accurate (at least as accurate, if not more, than devices I've used in the past—positioning of the device away from the wrist one and wearing it snugly helps out here). The app is an amazing companion.No tracker is perfect. It's unfair to expect that, at least at this point in time.This device is amazingly priced for what you get, looks good, feels good, and does its job well. I know it's only been two days, but it's already got me up and moving more than I would be otherwise. At a glance, I can see my steps, heart rate, calories burned, notifications from my phone, water intake, etc. AKA everything it is advertised to do. I have high hopes for the future with it. I do hope it remains durable over time. The fact that it is waterproof was a selling point for me; I simply do not wish to be concerned with a splash or a shower completely destroying the device.I would recommend it to those looking for a fun and functional tracker that won't quite break the bank. It does what it claims to do and it does those things well. Frankly, I love it. Some folks may find it does not meet their expectations, but I'd argue that those folks simply need to look to other devices with capabilities that are simply more in line with what they want to get out of the device. This is not a super-advanced device. But that's not what it claims to be. And for the average person like myself, it's perfectly adequate for fitness tracking purposes, and has met and exceeded my expectations so far. It gives that motivation and inspiration, and it gives the right information to work off of in order to make progress toward better fitness and health.",

I have owned 3 other Fitbit watches. I have owned the Alta without the hr monitor- which I loved the most because of its slim design, but also disliked because it didn't have the hr tracker. The band was annoying, because it would pop off when I did several wrist motions, or hit a corner. Due to that, I actually lost it. Then I owned the Fitbit Charge HR 2, it helped me lose 30 pounds! However I have extremely sensitive skin and no matter how much I cleaned it, I kept getting irritable rashes, and with no interchangeable bands- I gave the product to a friend of mine. Then I had the Fitbit versa, and it was just too large and dull for my liking. I left it in a friends car and it was stolen, thank god because now we're here. I preordered this watch, and watched reviews on it, and critics were saying the wrist band material is different, so I didn't immediately buy an interchangeable (only the IQ Shield, which I highly recommend if you're in the service industry, spend a significant time outdoors,or if you're as clumsy as me). And well the band is stunning. Matte black silicone, it's very light and smooth! I also have a ganglion cyst on my left wrist (reoccurring) that my physician says is due to lifting heavyweights (heavyweight lifter for 14 years). Usually these trackers would immediately agitate the cyst in this weird pulsing like way, but nada. For the price and function of this watch, I don't see how anyone couldn't rate it any lower than a 4. I'm extremely pleased and I hope the pedometer works better than the previous ones with my jogger (stroller). I'll update that after the weather clears. Also, after setup my watch had a hard time syncing to the app, if this happens to you just exit the app and reopen it a little later. Is it annoying? Maybe, but not as annoying as taking your watch off every time you shower, bath your kid, or aggressively wash your hands in the service industry. ALSO, this watch displays the date, which apparently the charge 3 does not, so exited!",

So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you're exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don't like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven't had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way.

            "Content": "  Ok, so at first I was really, REALLY hesitant about buying the Charge 2 because you never know what problems can arise with new, hot off the press tech. However, I've had wonderful experiences with Fitbit customer service in the past (as in \"Hey, my thing stopped working\" and they were all like \"Sorry about that, here's a new thing- no charge!\"), so I feel confident that if anything does go awry, Fitbit will take care of their customers. So, I took the plunge and ordered it.It came today in the mail and I scurried off with it like Gollum and his ring...My precioussssssss!Oh where to begin! Let's see- well it came in lovely, easy to open packaging. Opening up the box felt like I was arousing my Charge 2 from his slumber in his comfy, plastic bed. I immediately noticed that the teal color was more vibrant than its predecessor, and the larger screen gave it an all around sleeker look. The band is now longer, so if the large size from the old Charge was a bit big for you- go for the small with the Charge 2; I have tiny wrists myself, and I'm two notches away from the last ring on the inside! EDIT: I just realized my review was placed under the large size...my Charge 2 is a small. But large or small, only the band is different in length, NOT the screen!The charger was completely redesigned; the days of not having your Charge, well, CHARGE due to it slipping out are dead and gone. The new, blissfully longer charger clips onto the Charge itself, and as long as you align the hole in the charger with the button on the side of the Charge, you're good to go (see picture for reference)! Just make sure you clip it from underneath, and not over the screen or else it won't charge...not that I uh, made a silly mistake like that or anything. *cough*Setup could not have been easier. The entire process from taking it out of the box to having it fully synced and functional was less than ten minutes. Whoa. I was setting it up using the app on my Android phone, and I was expecting that it would need to be charged first but nope! It sprung to life and was ready to go!  After it was all synced I checked the battery and saw it was at medium power- right out of the freaking box!Onto features...do you like lots of features? I like lots of features and the Charge 2 has ALL the flipping features you could possibly want.I feel like Fitbit has been personally keeping tabs on me and my current interests. I just recently got into breathing meditation and interval training, and when I heard that the Charge 2 was going to include both these features I was pretty much like, \"Shut up and take my money!\"After playing with the Charge 2 for about 30 seconds, I came to realize that when you want to choose a feature, for example the breathing exercise, after pushing the button on the side to get to that function, you then hold the button for a second to choose to start it. With the breathing exercise, it allows you to choose between a 2 or 5 minute breathing session. It works by having you breath in rhythm with a ring that expands and contracts on the screen, and it shows your breathing in and out at the bottom with a continuous little graph (see picture to clarify if this sounds wonky to you.) If it comes across as confusing don't worry- Charge 2 guides you through it...it's much more talkative (err, textative?) than the old Charge, and I like it!So for once I was actually excited to hit the hall of pain- uh, I mean the gym, so I could test out my new buddy here. First thing I did was the elliptical; in the past I avoided it because my old charge wouldn't count it as steps. Now all you have to do is select the elliptical option from the workout menu on your charge 2, hold the button on the side and voila! Elliptical steps are now counted!Next I tried out the interval workout option! What's extra awesome about this feature is that it's customizable; the folks of Fitbit really outdid themselves with this one in my opinion. By going onto the app on my phone, I was able to set the intervals to one minute of workout, and two minutes of rest for a total of five sets. Then while I was on the treadmill, I went to the workout menu, chose interval training, and it started right away. Once the minute was up, Charge 2 gave me two little buzzes to let me know to switch to rest mode, and after two minutes gave me another two buzzes to pick it up again. The buzzes aren't very strong, but I still felt them just fine.Then I went onto strength training, and selected weights from the menu (this is all via the charge 2, not the app on the phone). Now the way I strength train is 3 sets of 12 reps, and then a minute of rest in-between. I'm honestly not sure if that minute of rest affects the readings or not, but my guess is no- that Charge 2 calculates everything based on pulse readings. And speaking of pulse readings, it feels like they've improved the technology in that department as well!FYI- I have pretty low blood pressure due to hypothyroidism, so the readings below may seem off, but they're accurate in my case. My resting heart rate is usually between 61 and 66 bpm (beats per minute)So that concluded my gym session. Upon looking at my readings later on, it was kind of neat to compare them. Now the weight training session showed that in 27 minutes I burned 99 calories and had 110 average of bpm. Now with the elliptical, I only did it for 10 minutes, burned 62 calories, and had a 130 average bpm going at a fast pace continuously. With the interval training on the treadmill (here's where it gets interesting folks) for 15 minutes I burned 122 calories with a 148 average bpm. Despite having two minute rest periods several times, I still burned more calories and had a higher heart rate than the continuous workout on the elliptical. Interval training all the way! Although...I wonder if you could do interval training on the elliptical and still have the steps count. I'll have to experiment with that... *EDIT* Yes you can in fact do interval training on the eliptical and have steps count!There's still so much to try! The connected GPS looks like a pretty neat feature, and it's a nice extra to include! I'm not much of a runner myself being bite sized, but you can still track location for other things like walking, biking and hiking. Then there's call, text, and calendar notifications (adding the calendar was a great idea). You can also change bands now, so if you wear out your current band (like I did with my old Charge- bubbling issues anyone?) or just want a different look, you can switch them whenever your little heart so desires. Oh! And there's lots of screen options that you can choose from like a dial watch,  extra bold print, and having time/date/steps/heart rate all together (which is what I ended up choosing)- and that's just to name a few!*EDIT* So they added a feature which shows your fitness level by going into the heart rate section of the app and then swiping left to get to that screen. I originally thought it was fitness test type thing, but I misunderstood. The app already calculates your fitness level for you based on several factors (resting heart rate, your bpm during exercises, and other information collected from your profile). So sorry for any confusion! No tests for you.Alas, there is but one problem I have encountered so far. I was walking while holding my phone in the hand that my charge 2 was on, and noticed that it didn't count my steps. So after experimenting for a bit (holding up my hands like I was pushing an invisible grocery cart, though it probably looked more like I was pretending to be A zombie) I came to the conclusion that if your hand is held up flat (palm up or palm down) in midair, like when holding a phone...the charge 2 doesn't register steps. However, it should be noted that when I put the charge 2 in workout mode, it DID count some of the steps, even when holding my phone, but it didn't seem to accurately count them all. I guess the solution is don't play on your phone while you walk? Or at least leave the hand with the Charge 2 on it by your side when playing Pokemon Go- you can play with one hand, right?Everything considered, this is truly an amazing piece of technology that is priced extremely fairly for all that it offers, including the best fitness app that is included at no extra charge. Thanks good guy Fitbit!In conclusion...This is the one fitness tracker...TO RULE THEM ALL!UPDATE: 9/20Yes yes, I know what you're all thinking- how could I possibly make this exceedingly long review even better? MAKE IT LONGER!Battery lasted from Wednesday afternoon (after fully charging it) to Monday night. It should be called Fitbit doesn't need to Charge all that often, amiright? Eh?Motivation Man! Every hour (just day hours, or you can customize which hours and days you want in the app) you don't move (or hardly move), Charge 2 gives you a friendly little buzz, and the animated little Motivation Man (as I like to call him) says something cute on the screen like \"Take me for a stroll?\" or \"97 more steps!\" (to reach 250). Do it. Don't let Motivation Man down.With the Fitness level tracker, my original score was placed in the good category and I was all happy that I was fitter than I thought. Well, the app suggests that if you want a more accurate reading, that you should go for a ten minute run outside with your Charge 2 synced to your phone for GPS tracking. So although I hate running more than kids who kick your seat continuously on a long flight, I did it. Upon looking at my fitness level thinking that my score was going to shoot up, it dropped down to fair, which is right after poor. Ouch. I mean in all fairness it's accurate but still...ouch. Went from feeling fitter to bitter.What's not accurate, however, is if you're at the gym and your Charge 2 syncs with your phone app for gps tracking. A few times while I was on the treadmill or elliptical, the GPS kicked in and gave me crazy readings. Now don' get me wrong- my step count wasn't affected in any way, the app just showed me a map of the wacky, non-existent trail that went though multiple buildings and over a river. You can just delete it of course, orrrrrr you could show it off to your friends and make stuff up...like I always teleport over rivers when I work out, doesn't everyone?The Fitbit app added a seriously impressive fitness game called Adventure challenge (it's in the challenges section) where your step count is shown on an actual map, like Yosemite Vernal falls to start off with, and the more you walk, the more you travel along the trail. Along the way you come across markers, and when you reach them, it shows you where you are on the trail with gorgeous panoramic pictures (hold up your phone, slowly turn left and right, and the picture pans out either way). There are also random \"gems\" on the map, and when you click them they either have a fun fact, a health multiple choice quiz, or a health challenge (like do tricep dips on a chair for a minute). You can collect them and earn a badge...or not-completely optional. However, I personally am having a blast with it, and I'm sort of stunned that they're including it in the app for free! It's like having an expensive dinner with Fitbit and when the check comes, Fitbit is all like, \"Hey, it's cool. I got this,\"...you sure do Fitbit. You sure do.",

Let me start with the negative comments that proved untrue and why:Myth 1: this Fitbit doesn't record accurate heart data, especially when working out. TRUTH: Yes it does record extremely accurately, including during workouts but you have to read the instructions!! When you workout the instructions say to tighten the strap one hole tighter than you usually wear it. Then you move the Fitbit 1-2 finger widths up from where your wrist meets your hand. After doing this I checked the Fitbit heart rate against my polar heart monitor every 5 minutes during a 45 min kickboxing workout. It was EXACTLY in tune with the polar heart rate monitor, always right on or within 5 BPM. The people who say otherwise are not following instructions or giving it a chance to figure out the best wrist placement.Myth 2: The light against your skin keeps you up at night/you can see the light as you try to sleep. TRUTH: No, you cannot see the blinking light that is against your skin. If you can then your band is way too lose. I wear it every night and never see the light blinking. I don't even remember I'm wearing it!Myth 3: it scratches easily. TRUTH: I've banged mine up pretty bad and to my surprise not a scratch in sight!Okay now for the negative comment that I discovered was true: It does not track steps when you are pushing a grocery cart or stroller. Sadly, this is true. Very frustrating when you have a child and you push them around the zoo all day in a stroller to later discover your steps barely moved. I solve this by letting my husband push the cart/stroller when possible. :) But this is the biggest negative for me about this Fitbit. I just learn to let the number on the screen go on those days when I have no one to push the cart and know that day I had a lot more steps than recorded.Things I love:1. The constant HR monitoring where you can see your heart health over time improve or get worse (in the Fitbit app)2. The sleep monitoring - this has been so eye opening! I can't wait to check the app in the morning to see how much deep sleep I had the night before. I now know based on my results how I'm probably going to feel that day.3. Getting texts and calls!! It buzzes when you get a text or call and will scroll the message across the screen or show you who is calling. LOVE this feature.4. Stays charged for a long time.5. LOVE that it shows you total calorie burn for the day. Like the calories your body burns just by sleeping or sitting to workouts. This was the biggest reason I got this Fitbit (besides the constant HR monitoring) so I could make sure I was truly burning the calories I thought I was burning to aid in weight loss. That helped me to I know exactly how many calories to cut to lose weight.Things I wish I could change/do but in no way a deal breaker:1. Rearrange which stat I see first when I tap my watch.2. Be able to set it so that I can constantly see my HR when I'm working out. It gets old tapping it several times while I'm working out to find my HR.3. I don't trust the calorie burn calculator. It seems really low. After a kickboxing workout where my polar monitor says I burned 300 calories, the Fitbit only recorded 130 calories. I'll keep looking into this and see if I can get something figured out. Thankfully you can add your workout in MyFitnessPal and it will sync up to the Fitbit app, including the calories you burned.4. Would be cool to have an option to add optional stats when you click through on your wrist, such as the weather.I recommend this Fitbit if you are looking to track constant HR, sleep, total calorie burn, and get alerted to texts and calls. I have learned so much about myself and my health.",

            "Content": "  I can't say enough good things about this fitness watch. This is going to be an in depth review so I apologize in advance for the length.First... THIS IS NOT MEANT TO ACT LIKE THE APPLE WATCH! I feel like a lot of people think, \"Well, for $50 more, I can get a refurb apple watch or an apple watch on sale at Best Buy.\" Having both watches, I can at least help with some differences between the two. If your goal is fitness tracking, this is for you. If your goal is organization with some fitness benefits, this watch is not for you.To simplify the product description, here is what it does. It continually tracks your heart rate, your steps, stairs climbed, calories burned, active minutes, miles, exercise, and sleep. It seamlessly works with the FitBit app, which can also help you keep track of your calories consumed (works with apps like MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, etc), water intake, and weight. You can also set a goal in the app that allows you to set how many hours of the day you want to take 250+ steps each hour, however it does NOT remind you to move to ensure your success with this (See10/19/16 update on cons section). You can also set notifications to come through from your phone to your watch, such as text messages, phone calls, calendar reminders, and control your iPod, iPhone, etc music from it. As of this review, photos and emoji's do not come through on the watch. As of this review, this watch has 4 different face options, the ability to set it to your dominant or non dominant wrist, silent alarms, all day sync with your phone, etc. It also has FitStar workouts built into it.Pros:-Continuous heart rate monitoring.-Easy to see in daylight (nice bright screen). Has the ability to turn \"auto\" light/dim based on sensing your lighting conditions.-Face turns on when it senses you've turned your wrist to view it. It is mostly accurate.-Charges quickly.-Charge lasts, realistically, more like 3-4 days, but if you don't have notifications on, I'm sure it could last for 5.-Sleek design looks like a nice watch. Many people have said, \"So how do you like your Apple Watch?\" and then I have to tell them it's not an Apple Watch. I do think that this watch is continually compared to the apple watch, however.Cons:-The band is somewhat uncomfortable, especially to sleep in. The buckle digs into my wrist on the side. I would like to see someone come up with a buckleless, soft silicone band like the apple watch.UPDATE: 11/26/16: I've had several companies reach out to me and send me bands to try. All of them have been the Milanese style bands and the ones that came from china caused major hives/break outs on my wrist, one of which required a prescription cream to resolve. I have no idea what they're using in their metals because I generally don't have problems with metals. One milanese band has worked consistently well for me without skin issues and no problems with the magnet slipping. It was one I purchased for around $30 on amazon. So be wary of that.Also, they finally started making silicone. Ands that do not have a buckle that are similar to the Apple Watch band. I ordered one and received it in the mail today. So far so good. It's much more comfortable than any other band I've tried. Please note this is NOT an affiliate link and none of the things in the post are sponsored.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01J0RAP3U/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1-As of the date of this review, the watch does NOT have \"reminder to move\" functionality. I feel like this is a basic essential to most fitness bands. Doing some reading, it looks like FitBit plans to have a firmware update in the future to include this, but as of now, it does not.UPDATE: 10/19/2016: Fitbit recently released an update to the Blaze with \"reminder to move\" however, I find it lacking. Essentially, it reminds you to move 10 minutes before the hour if you haven't gotten 250 steps in in the hours you have set to move 250 steps or more. What I would like to see is a reminder to move during hours that you set based on the amount of steps you want to achieve in a day. So if you want 10k steps between the hours of 6am and 8pm, let it remind you at a time you set (10 minutes or 15 minutes before the hour) if you haven't done 714 steps each hour in order to make it to that goal. I would also like to see something that reminds you to move if you've been \"sedentary\" for more than xx minutes. I had a fitness tracker several years ago that would buzz if you had been sedentary for 10 minutes. I liked that because it kept me active. This functionality would be great for people with office jobs that sit all day. It's nice to see Fitbit working at the solution of having reminders to move, but I don't think it's there yet.-The charger is somewhat annoying. FitBit has a proprietary charger so you can't just use any standard cord to plug it in. You have to take the face of the watch out of the band and put it in a boxed-frame like charger to charge. Given that the Apple Watch has a magnetic charger, I would have hoped to see something similar.This watch DOES NOT have an app store, it does not store music, you cannot respond to text messages, do facetime, send photos, etc from it. You cannot control your phone's camera from it. This watch is made for fitness and has basic smart watch functionalities, however it is made to be a fitness watch, not a smart watch.I have worked out with this on one wrist and my polar heart rate monitor watch (with chest strap) on the other wrist and got pretty much identical results.****YOU HAVE TO WEAR THIS WATCH JUST ABOVE YOUR WRIST BONE OR YOUR READINGS WILL NOT BE ACCURATE**** If you don't like wearing a watch on that area of your wrist, this may not be for you. I like loose fitting watches, so this was an adjustment for me.The face *could* scratch easily, I think. I haven't had a problem with it, but I did have a couple of glass screen protectors on it and they both broke within a day, but my watch face is still fine without scratches.I hope this review helps. I don't think I missed anything, but if I did, I will updated it in the future.",

I'm honestly surprised I didn't lose it sooner. While I loved the simplicity of the One, when I finally lost it the Flex 2 is the same price so I figured I'd try to make the switch.....I was nervous about a wrist tracker from stories about grossly inaccurate step counts. I have a very small wrist and found this to be thinner on my wrist than my Michael Kors watch. It is extremely lightweight, and simple. If you are \"gadgety\" and want more of a watch function, this won't be it for you. All it does is with 2 quick taps shows your progress on the buttons during the day. It will vibrate with calls and texts, and can remind you to move your 250 steps an hour. It has done a good job with sleep tracking, and I must say is pretty accurate with the step count.Pros:Extremely lightweight, not bulky and the lavender is a gorgeous color.Easy to snap on, and can be worn loose or snug.Water proof-I don't wear it in the shower but put it on right after and don't have to worry about unclipping like my old one when I switch from Pj's to work pants, to workout gear, etc.....Put it on and forget about it (unlike the dressing room I had to go back to 2 hours later after trying on clothes once).Vibrates with texts/calls/reminds you to move every hourEasy syncing/tracking on phone-you can't see anything from the band so you have to sync periodically throughout the day from the app. I have my phone all the time so that's not a big deal for me.Removable tracker pops out easily and can be used in other accessories.Cons:No watch/HR/caller ID functionNo stair climber function-for some reason I really liked that with the One. Kinda bummed.Overall I would say this is an excellent product. Since I have a watch and am not a hardcore workout person, I don't need the extra bells and whistles of other Fitbit models. It does the job, and is holding up nicely. Would recommend.",

This wasn't the fault of the Fitbit; I work in a cafe so I'm constantly washing either dishes or my hands. Even being careful it got wet a lot, and I suppose even water resistance has its limits.The difference between water resistant and water proof is why I went with the Flex 2, as opposed to just getting another charge  So far it's held up beautifully, I do try to remember to take it off at the end of my shifts and wipe it down, just to be sure.As for actual functionality, I'd say it compares well to my charge. I like the minimalism of the display, and the clasp on this band is MUCH better than on the charge, which popped off my wrist more than once.I especially like the various alerts, including the reminder to get up and move. It's motivated me to take laps around my kitchen island to get my steps a couple times. No shame! And as someone who regularly gets up before 5am, the silent alarm is wonderful. It wakes me up easily without waking my husband. That's a huge bonus in my book.Overall, this seems to be fairly accurate in terms of step count, although I'm not as dogmatic about that as some people. I just want to know that I am moving throughout the day, and that I have some accountability to myself when it comes to reaching my goals. The only thing I wish is that I could set the auto-detect for active minutes a little lower. My walk to work takes about 7 minutes, and if I forget to turn on exercise tracking, it doesn't always get counted. That's honestly my only gripe and it's a small one.This is a great tracker, it works well, charges quickly, and once it's on my wrist I forget it's there. It's been a great help in striving for my fitness goals.",

            "Content": "  I've had this little guy for over a year now - I wanted to get some mileage out of it before I reviewed it - and I'm still a big fan.First - I opted with the Fitbit One because a.) it had high reviews and b.) I wanted something that did both sleep tracking (so Zip was out) and I didn't have to wear in an ugly bracelet on my wrist (so pretty much everything else was out). I usually keep this in my pocket or clipped to my bra - works great in both places.ACCURACY: when I first got it (and a few times since then) I walked around counting my steps then checked with the fitbit -each time it's been within about 3 steps of how many steps I counted out of 50, regardless of if I wear it on my wrist, clipped to my bra, or in my pocket. just now I stuck it on my wrist and shook my hand back and forth vigorously 20 times and it added on 8 steps, so if you really want to cheat the system you can - though it probably will take more effort to shake on extra steps than actually just walk. I haven't had any problems with it adding on a lot of steps after car rides. I had a baby 6 months ago and have found that it counts bouncing up and down to calm a fussy baby as a step, but I'm cool with that - it's pretty much like jogging in place. the floors climbed feature seems fairly accurate - I haven't actually spent a day counting how many times I go up and down our stairs to compare it and it think it sometimes will count walking up a steep hill as a flight of stairs (once again, I'm cool with that), but on days i'm cleaning the house and thus going up and down stairs more often than usual my flight count is significantly higher.  whether or not it gets your distance correct depends on how accurately you set your stride length - I think the easiest way to make sure it's set correctly is to go for a walk and set the GPS tracker on your phone if you have one, then once you get to 1 mile on the GPS check and see what your fitbit is telling you then adjust accordingly.SLEEP TRACKER:  it's cool, it shows when you're \"asleep\" (not moving), when your \"restless\", and when you're \"awake\" - there are two settings sensitive and normal, apparently normal is if you're wearing it on your wrist and sensitive is if you have it in a pocket or something (because some pajama's have pockets - you know, for when you need to hold stuff while you're sleeping . . .) I set it on normal because I wear it on my wrist. I tried it on sensitive for a while to see if it worked better - it just freaked me out and told me only 1/2 of my time in bed was spent sleeping - I started wondering if I really was tired and not well rested, even though I never felt like I had trouble sleeping before. . . -  just read the instructions and don't freak yourself out.  Often times it will show me \"restless\" times during the night when I am definitely awake nursing - I guess there's a certain movement threshold you have to pass to be considered \"awake\", so it's not 100% accurate in that regard. it also doesn't coach you in sleeping well - just gives you the raw data on what happened during your night. (which has been super helpful with nursing  - it's nice to see the trends of how long the baby's sleeping, how often we're getting up, how long we really are up for, etc. without having to have the presence of mind to make note of it while I'm half asleep).  you can set goals on the app for how much sleep you're aiming for each night and set goal go-to-bed and wake-up times. putting the fitbit into and out of sleep mode is super easy (you hold down the button till it buzzes) and if you forget to put it in sleep mode one night or accidentally let it run well into your morning it's easy to go in and fix the times on the app. I love the silent alarms - I was skeptical that a little thing buzzing on my wrist would wake me up - but it works great and my husband appreciates how quiet it is. there is no snooze - which is good for me because I'm one of those snooze five times type people - this forces me to set a realistic time to get up and do it (though to be honest, I set a second alarm 10 minutes after the first one just incase. . .) you can set as many alarms as you want and have them go of on any day you want, so if you want to set alarms to remind you to get up an move around every hour or have an alarm that only wakes you up on  * Note: I'm not a big fan of the little sleep wrist thing that comes with the fitbit. after a few months the velcro stated pulling it apart. For a while I cut off the top of  one of my husband's socks and wore it folded in thirds on my wrist with the fitbit tucked inside-  that worked OK but some nights the fitbit slipped out - now I have a cheap 3rd-party silicone wrist band thing made to fit the fitbit in it - it works great.DURABILITY: I have accidentally washed my fitbit twice and dried it once. it survived. And it counted the spin cycle as active minutes. The charge still lasts for a week or more. I don't recommend forgetting the fitbit in your laundry, but it has held up well to the wet and the heat. I wear it while working out and sweat has never seemed to be a problem for it. It's been over a year and is still working exactly the way it did when I got it. Two weeks ago the little plastic piece on the back of the silicone clip broke - I super glued it back together and so far so good. the clip itself would still be somewhat functional without that little plastic piece - it would just have a metal part poking out that could be poky- but you also can buy third-party replacement clips for $5 or spring for the actual Fitbit replacement clip  for 3X more if branding is important to you.APP - i Like the app a lot. I've used it both on a Samsung tablet (android) and on an Iphone and both work great. you can set daily goals, see how much of your daily goal you've achieved, get weekly/monthly/quarterly historical graphs, track your weight, amount of water drank, calories, etc. I also like that you can get rid of things you don't want on it - for example I don't track my calories so i took that tile off my app and don't have it sitting there wasting space. in the settings there is a spot to mark if you are pregnant or breastfeeding - I don't know exactly what that does - my guess is it ups your daily calorie allotment - and maybe takes that into consideration when it tells you how many calories you've burned.  I don't do the friends and competitions part of it - but there's a platform to connect with people you know and set little competitions or group goals - honestly the idea of me seeing what everyone else is doing and everyone seeing what I'm doing isn't very appealing, but it could be fun accountability if you set a goal with a friend/familyIMPACT ON YOUR LIFE: Know thyself. Having this won't inherently make you healthier. I got this because I like tracking things and this gave me a way to gamify my activity - I set goals and I can see exactly how close I am to hitting them each day - which is a strong motivation factor for me - at 8PM if I see that I'm still 4000 steps shy of my daily step goal I'm much more likely to suggest we take an after-dinner walk in the evening. I've been drinking more water because I'm keeping track of it.  It helped me track my activity level through my pregnancy and is helping me see how getting back in shape afterwards is going, I'm also glad I'll have this archived so when I get pregnant again I can see how I track compared to this pregnancy. If you're like me it will be strong motivation for you. If your highly competitive getting one of these then competing with your friends on it might work, or having an accountability partner who can see your daily activity may help keep you motivated. If none of those things pique your interest this probably isn't a good investment, but it is a well made product.",

I think it's probably more adhesive (I even got the extra hold from good lines) and I think this stuck to me a lot more. With that being said, it's an absolute must to saturate with oil before removing because it does not want to budge. And I'd advise in investing in disposable nipple covers because mine got saturated in oil when I was removing the tape and I can't get it out lol. I sat in the tub and saturated with baby oil and gradually took them off when the adhesive started to lift.",

If you need to adjust it after it is stuck then you will need to remove it and throw it away since the stick will not be very strong after. Make sure you apply the pasties otherwise your nips aren't going to be very happy. The instructions has pictures of different options on how you can use this, but you can look online and see what other women are doing. Make sure you take your time because if you take the backing off the tape right away it could cling to the other side and you will be wasting it again. There is a learning curve with this so you will want to practice. Each end of the tape you won't be stretching and just push it down real well where you're going to have it and then the middle portion will be stretched to get your lift. The tape is pretty thick, so some of the options may not work for certain tops or dresses otherwise you will see it. One way I learned long ago is to basically lean over like you are touching your knees and tape them when they are like that. Back in the day we used to use duct tape lol. Overall, this works and it's nice to have but like I said you are going to want to practice or research it so you don't go through all the tape.

As such, I can't say how many flaws there are in this ball's performance, because there's enough in my own game to make it impossible to know when a bad shot might be due to an inferior ball.  That said...I lose golf balls.  A LOT.  So it's not worth it to me to pay the premium price for the top-of-the-line balls out on the market, even when I can find them on sale.  So price was a major factor in my decision to buy these in the first place.  The other was the color...I'm slightly colorblind, so I lose white golf balls FAR too often...they get out about 150 yards or so and I just can't see them anymore, most of the time.There are cheaper balls on the market.  I know, I've tried them.  I like the feel of these better...I feel like I get better response off the club and better ball flight out of these than anything else I've tried in this end of the market (after playing these, the other, cheaper golf balls that I used to play with feel like I'm hitting wooden balls or small rocks by comparison).  And the color is immensely helpful to me in my game...these are not just yellow balls, this shade of yellow stands out more than most for me and makes it a lot easier for me to track my shots and find my ball.  I get comparable results from these that people I've golfed with are getting from upscale, premium-priced balls, so I'm really pleased with them, overall.My only complaint is, they aren't very durable.  Pretty much any time I end up in the sand with one of them, that ball has a permanent scuff from the shot to get back out (the one place where the cheaper balls I've played with hold up better).  But I typically wind up losing a scuffed ball a few shots later, anyway, so it's not like that scuff mark gets a lasting chance to mess up my game.I don't see myself changing to a new brand anytime soon.

On this old pair, the velcro was right where his watch was and it would rub and get in the way. Also, these are a bit shorter in the wrist so they don't go the whole way up to where he wears his watch, which he prefers.He orders up a size in gloves (often will wear size L for winter gloves but buys XL in golf gloves so that his fingers go the whole way to the end). After wearing these a bit, they did not stretch out and become too loose in the fingers.Even though these are half-synthetic, half-leather leather, they feel soft and supple. The addition of Lycra makes them stretchy. They have a lot of venting in them from big holes on top of fingers to small ones on the underside. It helps with airflow (all golf gloves seem to get a little sweaty but these don't make your hand feel like you're in a sauna). The construction of these gloves is good - double stitching, no missed stitches.The gloves work well as far as allowing him to feel like he has good grip on his clubs.Overall, these are his new favorite gloves.

I went with the yellow ball because of my ball losing past, these are quite easy to see, even among yellow range balls because they are so bright. They generate a ton of distance with all my clubs and a lot of spin off irons to hold greens. Felt great off the driver and hybrids off tees and had a piercing long flighted baby draws. The only thing for me was that they added 10 yards to all my clubs vs. Titleist AVX 2019 which I was trying out and liked. But this is just better perfomance. I think this is pretty close to Pro V1x which is also about ideal for me performance wise. TP5 and ProV1 feels a little softer which some like,  but gives up some performance for me. For chipping it gets awesome spin and I can get it close to the hole on regular chips from missed greens because the spin helps it stop faster. I'm not afraid to put some spin on this ball hitting with a little more swing speed on chips and flight it a little closer to the hole.

After retiring that ball, the new ball in play promptly hit a concrete cart path and scuffed a little so they are not cart path proof, but are otherwise the most durable Tour Ball I have ever played. I usually buy end of season Tour Balls when they drop by $10 or more and stockpile them like the world's ending. ProV1s are my #1 favorite to play because they sound and feel so beautifully when struck right, but I have no hesitation at putting the TP5x in play during my golf league. Short irons and wedges I can usually one hop and stop or spin back, depending on the conditions, no matter the ball I play, and these TP5x balls are no different. For me, the reason to use Tour Balls is for the extra distance, less unwanted sidespin on straight shots, and more shaping spin when I want to work the ball (driver cuts on doglegs, big hook-draws on sucker pins, etc.).One thing I have to remember is that with the stop and drop Tour Balls, you don't get that extra roll-out like on the range, so on a 130 yard approach shot with the pin in the back, you better have your distances dialed in because you will need to land the ball as close to the pin as possible unless you like 80 foot putts.I like the Callaway Superhots for distance and supreme durability but I find that I can't work them as subtly as Tour Balls. Putting Tour Balls feel much better than anything else and TP5x fits that bill too.I don't know if Callaway and TaylorMade designate the \"x\" balls the same as Titleist's \"x\" because I prefer TP5x and ChromeSoftX along with ProV1 (not V1x). It's my understanding that the ProV1x flies higher with the ProV1 having a more penetrating trajectory which appears to align with Callaway's and TM's \"x\" line. Regardless, I don't think you can go wrong with the TP5x if you are used to playing a Tour Ball and would be a great introduction to Tour Balls if you wanted to make the switch. Buy them at the end of the season to save some money before they add new and improved technology to the next model.For reference, I usually hit my XR16 driver about 290 on the range and get about 305+ with Tour Balls on the course.",

It is a combination of a big \"T\" and a black line through the middle. The big white \"T\" allows you to easily see your aim direction and get a feel for how square your putter surface is to your ball. The thin black line allows you to dial it in a little more.I don't know the science behind copper being a better putting surface to strike from, but you can't ignore the fact that it looks and sounds amazing. The entire putting surface and three additional accent pieces are made from 100% Copper!The superstroke grip, combined with a no step shaft take out some of the variables that affect a smooth, consistent swing. The standard grip that comes on this club is a 1.0 Pistol Grip.The neck comes in different styles customized for your putting shape. The \"Single Bend\" is for golfers with minimal face rotation, the \"Small Slant\" is for significant face rotation and the \"L-Neck\" if for somewhere in between.Overall a putter that will help drop you putts and drop your score.

I have not yet used it extensively, so my review is based on only a few hours on the practice green.Since I have a slight arc to my swing, I ordered the L-Neck putter.  The L-Neck is supposedly designed for golfers with a swing like mine.  This is a good looking club.  Not that looks improve the game, but it does not hurt when the club looks impressive.  The included cover also looks good, fits well, and is soft.When using the club, the first thing that I noticed was the grip.  It felt comfortable in my hands, and since the grip was new, it felt very solid (sticky), with no tendency to slip either with or without a glove.Up until now, I have only used a blade putter, so this mallet putter is a first for me.  Wilson advertises this putter as one that looks like a mallet but that feels like a blade.  Since I have not used a mallet, I cannot compare this club's feel to a mallet's feel, but compared to my blade, it does seem somewhat similar.  This may be because of the putter's “FCG,\" or Forward Center of Gravity, design.  There is a bit more weight to the club head than I am used to, but not so different that I will need a large learning curve to become comfortable using it.  With the contrasting colors on the club head, the sight line is very noticeable and easy to use to line up my puts.I found the swing to have a comfortable feel to it, and not much different from my current putter.  The ball comes off the club stronger, and with a longer roll than usual with similar swing effort, which I will need to get used to. The ball seems to be better aimed than with my other club.  As for whether that is because the aiming line is allowing me to line up better, or because the club design is correcting some of my defects, only more practice will give me that answer.My initial impressions of the putter are very favorable.  I am looking forward to getting more practicewith it, and hopefully I will see an improvement in putting strokes.",

The laws of physics mean that it will continue in the same direction and will do so with less swing  effort.  That keeps club twisting at a minimum for most people.  Couple all that with the three inch center siting line and I think most golfers will find their putts going straighter and with a better line toward the hole.Of course the Spider does not read the green contours for you or determine how fast it is,  skills that take both aptitude and effort.Fortunately the Spider comes with a nice velcro cover because with a head this big it gets a lot more knocking around in my golf bag than the old Bulls Eye.",

But a few weeks ago, the band was feeling a bit wobbly, I unclipped it from the Alta tracker (for the first time ever, actually, as I wasn't sure how to correctly take it apart), and I decided to clean off the band. The strap seems to be two pieces fused together (there is the long portion that actually wraps around your wrist, and a smaller portion fused with it that actually straps to the alta). Well, the strap was coming loose from the portion that connects to the tracker, and I thought these two parts of the strap must come apart to clean it (they do not!). When I separated the inner section of the strap, I realized that it could not be attached back to the strap. Honestly, I think the strap would have broken on it's own in another month or two, as it had been wobbly for awhile, but regardless, it seems like the wristband itself is not very well made.All that aside, I love this plum color for a wristband. My original band still looked pretty great despite being worn practically 24/7 for several months. I highly recommend choosing the purple, as it is a dark enough color not to show wear or tear too much and it looks really classy.",

I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.",

I'm not a huge fan of smartwatches so I wasn't interested in the more fully featured Fitbit products. Seeing the Charge 3 released prompted me to consider it.Coming from an Alta, I was a bit concerned about the size. This has not been a problem. It's larger, sure, but it fits the wrist nicely and isn't heavy at all. I have not had any comfort issues. I ordered a different style band, however, more along the lines of what I'm use to using.The Charge 3 has a lot more power and features than the Alta, so my opinion of it may be a bit rose tinted compared to those coming from the Charge 2. The battery life is great. The usability is great. The features are much more extensive. I, especially, like seeing my estimated sleep stages, and my heart rate info. I'm looking forward to the update that enables the SpO2 functionality.As I noted, I'm not a fan of smartwatches. I disabled notifications on my Alta, and, even though I can see more details about my notifications on the Charge 3, I'm likely to turn that down or off. I'm the type of person that doesn't need to immediately see what my phone just beeped about, as I'd rather keep my attention on the task or event at hand. I will note that the vibrate is quite powerful, though.It's nice to have an altimeter again. My Fitbit One had this, but for some reason the Alta excluded it. As I've pushed myself to take the stairs more and more, I love being able to track it again.The one flaw I'll note, and it's enough to knock a star off, is the auto brightness doesn't seem to dim enough in low light. Just by moving at night, the brightness of the display has woken me up because it was right next to my eyes. As I saw one person put it, the brightness of the display burns like that of a thousand suns. I've noticed the auto brightness seems to do something sometimes, but it doesn't dim near enough in the dark and can be quite jarring when not expected.As this was just released, I'm sure all the software faults, that of the missing features in the watch faces noted by others, and the auto brightness issue, etc, will be fixed in due time. Overall, this is a nice upgrade from the Alta and will keep me on the Fitbit platform for another couple of years, I'm sure.",

A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day.

            "Content": "  Let me start by saying that I am first time Fitbit and Apple watch user. I couldn't find a lot of reviews comparing the two, so I decided to purchase both and return one of them. Which one is better? Well that depends on what you're using it for.A little about me: I'm a 29 year old guy who works out 3-5 days a week with weights and runs 2-4 miles a day at an 8:30-9:00 minute pace. I work as a Resident Physician in a busy ER and originally wanted a pedometer see how much I walk in a given work day.Appearance and build quality: Winner- AppleFirst up was the Fitbit charge 2. The packaging was great, very \"Apple\" like, but the build quality of the device left something to be desired. The band is made of a comfortable silicone and the display appears to be a \"cheap\" appearing plastic. While the device won't impress on looks, it is somewhat low profile and and comfortable on the wrist. The screen itself isn't the most responsive, but it works well enough. The display is bright and easily visible. I did not have trouble seeing the screen outdoors.The apple watch was everything you'd expect from an Apple product. Sleek, responsive, and user friendly. I'd stop short of calling it \"stylish\", but it feels noticeably more polished than the FitbitFitness: Winner- FitbitHere's where the two products completely diverge. I found the Fitbit to be an incredible fitness device compared to the Apple watch. Everything is streamlined for fitness with the Fitbit, while the apple watch is cluttered and optimized as a \"smart watch\". With a quick glance on the fitbit I can see the time, my steps taken, and heart rate. It takes just seconds to set up a workout and scroll the the menus. The beauty of fitbit lies in it's simplicity. The apple watch can also show steps taken, and heart rate, but does not give you continuous monitoring of heart rate like the fitbit. The fitbit can also track sleep, and give you an estimate of your cardio fitness score (V02 Max).Other features: Clearly the fitbit is not a smart watch, but the text and call notifications are great when you're working out and don't have quick access to your phone. Yes, you can't see the whole text, but i'm not using this feature to replace my phone, I'm using it to screen for important texts or calls that I would need to stop my workout for. The apple watch on the other hand can text, call, and use many of the same apps as your iPhone. If you have apple music you can also listen to music on Bluetooth headphones. The built in GPS and waterproofing are great features as well.Accuracy: TieI have no idea what the negative reviews are talking about (Maybe they received a defective device or have exceptionally hairy arms?). The fitbit is impressively accurate with resting and active heart rate. I've compared manual hearts and treadmill measurements with a variation of +/- 5 while active and +/- 2 at rest. I don't care if my real heart is 155 or 158 while I workout, I just want to know what zone i'm in. My run this morning was within .03 miles of my phone GPS, and the pace was spot on. Good enough for me, but i'm not a competitive runner. The apple watch is slightly more accurate when it comes to distance, and probably more suited for someone who runs at a competitive pace. Steps taken? I give the edge to fitbit. Apple watch skipped a lot of my steps and took a while to update. Yes, the fitbit adds 20-30 steps while I sleep, and another 20-30 while I drive. But I do these things every day, so who cares? I care about the trends. I'm not a competitive walker. Sleep seems accurate as well and is excellent for trending. I can tell when I have a restless night and the fitbit is great for quantifying that. You cannot track sleep with the Apple watch. No idea if the calories burned are accurate for either product, but again, trends.The App: Winner- FitbitI think this where the fitbit completely shines as a fitness product. The app is so user friendly, so streamlined, and generally fun to play around with. I love watching my cardio fitness score change and keeping an eye on my resting heart rate overnight. Apple has a ton of 3rd party apps which are great, but it lacks the complete integration of the fitbit.Final thoughts:The reality is that these are completely different products used for completely different reasons. I haven't decided which one I will be keeping yet, but if I were basing my decision on fitness alone, at a non competitive level, I would choose the fitbit hands down. There are other useful features that make the Apple watch appealing in my line of work, so I'll have to weigh those into my decision.Overall, the fitbit makes fitness fun. It's packed with so many cool features, and really is a motivator for daily movement. It is perfect for someone who wants to streamline their fitness goals and keep track of their life. It is a wear all day and all night product.The apple watch doesn't have the same coolness factor with regard to fitness, and really doesn't motivate me to workout anymore than my iPhone would. It is perfect for someone who doesn't care about tracking fitness goals, but wants to leave their phone at home during a workout. The ability to stream music, track distance with a built in GPS, and respond to text messages are wonderful. This is a take off during the day and never wear at night product. I would use this primarily as a smart watch with the added bonus of being incredibly useful for running.If you do decide on the fitbit, be careful with sizing! I have a 7 inch wrist and the large band fits me on the last 2-4 holes (keep it loose when not working out). In other words, the band runs pretty large.For reference, the Apple watch is 38 mm in grey.Hopefully that helps!",

            "Content": "  Is Fitbit Blaze still useful when many watch makers and smart watches are being pushed to the market daily? Lets find outI was a fitbit user before this, I owned the first gen Fitbit Charge HR. My wife and I both owned one. It was good, it does what it advertised till it broke down a few weeks back. I then start to look around for a replacement. What I needed were,1. A 24/7 heart monitoring2. A battery life of minimum 3 days3. Sleep tracking4. A screen5. Steps tracking6. Distance tracking7. Stop watch8. Not bulky9. Minimum rain and splash proofAdditional feature that will affect my decision1. Water resistant, so I can take it for a swim or shower2. GPS module included so I do not need to carry my phone when I jog3. Music ControlI started to look around, and ended with Garmin Vivo Smart series and Fitbit Charge HR 2, they both met what I wanted, and Garmin actually have the additional features that I would like to have. I almost go for Garmin, until I started to look into Fitbit Family of activity tracker. I found out fitbit surge will fit the criteria too, albeit with a mono display screen, which made it feels a bit of outdated.Long story short, I then chose Fitbit Blaze in the end and after receiving it and using it for 3 months now, I am going to pen down my thoughts on it.Fitbit Blaze is a squarish module tracker which is removable from the strap itself, allowing you to get creative with your watch strap. There are lots of alternative watch strap that you can purchase to suit different events that you will be attending.Build Quality (9/10)Default watch strap is made of silicon with diagonal texture strip. I like it because it does not get uncomfortable when I wear it for my basketball games and jogging session. It does not irritate my skin but for some, it might. The square module itself seems to be constructed nicely. It is a square and nothing more. Button are accessible and you will get the hang of it without reading the manual.Screen (8/10)No fancy technology on the screen used. From the specs it looks like a low quality screen, I will not disagree, the pixel that made up the digits can be easily seen when watch is put closer to the eyes. However on daily occasions, the distance from the glance we made to view the time, is far enough, and the screen do look bright and clear enough.There are four modes to the screen adjustment – Dim, Normal, Max, Auto.I used only Dim, in order to maximise the battery. It is hard to see under direct sunlight under the DIM mode. If needed you can always set it to AUTO. On daily usage indoor and most outdoor situation, I find the DIM mode sufficient.Touch screen is responsive, and there is nothing for me to complain about.Customer Service (10/10)They are top notch, upon receiving my Fitbit Blaze, I only realised a small dent at the bottom of my watch and I contacted the Fitbit Support Team. After a couple of emails, they actually offered to send a replacement to me. It only takes 2 days for them to make the decision, and about 1 week for the replacement to reach me. I am happy, that they took attention to my enquiry and acted on it.I wasn't expecting them to make a decision so fast. They were above my expectations.Battery Life (9.5/10)Normal smart watches last about 24 hours. Even the latest fossil Q is no diff. Some tracker last 3 days while others which utilises changable battery last for months.Newer tech with kinetic energy will have a infinite battery life. For Fitbit Blaze, it last me usually for 4 to 5 days. This is inline with what they advertised and what I have expected.My bluetooth is on to PAIR mode 24/7, you can choose to off it if you want. And I am on DIM mode for brightness of my screen.It got a score of 9.5 because in comparison with garmin and apple watch, it triumphs over them. I am satisfied with the battery life.But of course, if they eventually adopts the kinetic energy tech, it will definitely be 10.Features (8.5/10)Fitbit Blaze is one that function like a smart watch and activity tracker. The features include- Smartphone notifications. You can choose what kind of notifications to receive via the Fitbit App- Music control via Bluetooth, however it does not work when your music playing device is connected to another device via Bluetooth. For example I connected my phone to my Bluetooth headphone to listen to my music. Fitbit Blaze will not be able to use the music control function, even though it is connected to my phone as well. However notification still comes in.- VO2 matrix- Breathing under the Relax Mode- Linked with Fitstar for different exercises- Exercise mode which can help you track different kind of exercises you are doing- Sleep tracking which will separate sleep stages into – Awake, REM, Light and Deep Sleep. There are also benchmark and 30 days average for you to compare the quality of your sleep- 3rd party app which can be connected to inject “Fun” into your watch. App like Wokamon, a virtual pet app, which will take the steps taken and convert it to experience for you to level up your own pet that you are raising in the app.This section did not get a higher rating because of the loss of music control function when my music playing device has got another Bluetooth device connected to it. I also look forward to a GPS module included and a waterproof rating so I can safely take it to swim.App (9/10)Apart from the need of switching on my GPS on my phone, the rest is good. The interface is easy to use, and it is easy to change the settings around. You can arrange the positions of the stats that you want to see in the Fitbit App. You can connect with your friends and with all the badges, it can act as an extra motivation to keep you going.Final wordsWhat I would like to see is probably an integrated mic, so I can do voice note to my phone and reply voice messages, however I do understand that it will then move the tracker towards a smart watch. I do think fitbit can excel well in that field too!Well, thankfully, I guess I made the right choice. Albeit some features I wanted like GPS module and water resistant aren't there, it still make a good day to day tracker and a semi smart watch. I can change the strap anytime I want. For sports and for work. I am happy with their customer service even though some will disagree.I will never know if the heart rate monitor is the most accurate, but I do know at this current moment, nothing can be 100% precise, so I use it to see abnormal heart rate activity in me which is useful. If you are a previous fitbit user, this will make a nice upgrade. The app is as good as before too. With the price tag, the value is hard to beat.I do think that this is meant for people with moderate exercise activity and is not meant for hard core trainers. It is meant to monitor your well-being and encourage a more active lifestyle, it is versatile in its outlook and enough features to make it a semi smart watch.

It tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this! Thanks!",

            "Content": "  I was provided Fitbit Surge from REI at no cost to test 6 months ago. Here are my thoughts after 6 months of use:I have been using it every day along with the Fitbit app on my iPhone 6 and the Fitbit Dashboard on my Macbook Pro. Here are my observations:░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░❖ The app on my iPhone allows me to easily enter the type of food I am eating and the amount of calories, and calories from fat. The app is synched up with a HUGE database and allows you to scan a barcode on a package and it automatically shows you the pertinent nutritional information. I have used this feature on about 40 items so far, and about 70-80% of these items were in the database. The others I added manually, but then you can pull the up easily the next time you eat that food item. You can also type in the name of a restaurant and it will pull up items on their menu. It has worked on 100% of the these with 95% of the items listed.❖ Setting my weight loss and gain goal is wonderful! It asks your current weight, your target weight and how long you want to take to get there (It shows you the date you should achieve your target weight in 3-4 categories ranging from Easy to Difficult). I have lost  5lbs in the last 6 days. I have been rather ambitious! Other goals can be set and tracked!❖ It's a great motivator to get in shape. If you're the type of person that likes to track data and finds that seeing your progress helps you to get going, then this is a GREAT product. This tracker has greatly enhanced my motivation by allowing me to see my progress in multiple areas. The app and dashboard not only show you your workouts (so you can compare and see your progress), but they also allow your to track your calories in and calories out. You can also record your water intake. These elements have been literally life-changing for me.❖ The dashboard gives you badges and motivational \"splashes\". Fitbit also will send you a weekly email showing your weekly stats and progress \"at a glance\". All very helpful and encouraging.❖ The tracker itself is VERY comfortable. The sleep tracking has been helpful in showing how many times I am \"restless\" during the night.❖ The tracker charges very quickly. I have docked it while taking a shower with half battery life and after my shower (10-15 mins) it looks fully charged. I have had no issues with better life whatsoever, and considering all that it does - the battery last longer then I would expect.❖ The workout variety is great and it allows you to customize your workouts, so the tracking possibilities are endless. The dashboard gives you very detailed information on multiple areas including (for a walk): Elevation, Pace, Heart Rate, Heart Rate Zones, Calorie Burn and Impact on Your day. The GPS works flawlessly, and as long as I'm outside, does not take long at all to hook up (5-10 secs). I have used the Exercise area for: Running and Weight Lifting❖ The face of the tracker is very nice, the displays are less then \"dazzling\", but I realize this is probably part of the reason for the long battery life. I don't mind not having the \"glitzy\" face of the MS product. This is much more effective from what I have read. The build of the device is strong and I expect it to last a long time. No issues with inadvertently swiping the face, it does so easily but not often accidentally. The back light works really well. I have left mine set to \"auto\" and it seems to come on just at the right time.░░░░░CON'S░░░░░❖ The HR Monitor does drop during high intensity workouts. I usually start my workouts with cardio so if I am on an elliptical it works just fine. I literally can grab the HR monitor on the gym elliptical and watch my Surge and they almost always change simultaneously! I would say that 90% of the time they are matching perfectly or 1 beat off. That's pretty amazing! So, after my cardio I move quickly to weight training on \"selecterized\" equipment. This is where the HR tracking can go haywire. Because of the rapid arm movements, and possibly the level of sweat that is being generated - the tracker can go from 130 BPM to 98 BPM in a second. Now, I know that my HR is not doing that. I tried all the suggested fixes: sliding up my arm further, making sure it was loose enough, tight enough, etc. and nothing seemed to work. I even called fitbit. They recommended I try it on my other arm. I did, really no difference. In this area, it just seems like the technology has limits. They also have their limitations and if the area that reads becomes dry - it also will drop out or get irregular readings. I don't' think Fitbit is going to be able to change this inconsistency through firmware or software updates due to the \"anatomical limits\" of the technology. The good news is, if you take a min or two and reposition the device it can go back to an accurate reading and overall, your workout should be close to the correct amount of calories burned.❖ The only other gripe I have is that the device can record \"faulty\" steps. Now, if I am out on a walk or \"walking\" it does just fine. BUT, I can sit (just did) and wave my arm around and steps will be recorded. I just logged 5 steps sitting and writing this review by waving my arm around. If you're a person that talks with your hands, this can problematic. The floors climbed is also cool and seems to be very accurate.░░░░░BOTTOM LINE░░░░░I give the Surge 4 stars. I really would like to see more consistent readings of the HR monitor during intense workouts and find a way to not have the device pick up \"false\" steps, but I realize that the technology is still young. The many pluses that come with the Surge (to me) outweigh the negatives, so I am happy overall with it.***If you like this review, please mark this review as helpful!

For $6, we have had so much fun, the kids are rocking their math and are getting a boatload of exercise.Here are the two main ways we use them:1️⃣ Throw some in the pool (they will sink unless sitting perfectly on top of the water) and have a race to get 10 hearts, all even numbers, numbers divisible by 3, etc.2️⃣Throw only the numbered cards (2-10) into the pool (you can do all numbered or only red or black, for example) and then have the kids race to bring back cards which make an equation to make a certain number.  The kids absolutely love this!!!  We also make rules like: - your equation must be at least 3, 4 or 5 cards - we exclude the 10s - we exclude \"double digits\"...  meaning you can only get one of each number.  No 2x2, for example - If I'm feeling like a softie, we'll even include the Aces to use as ones. But that makes it soooo much easier so beware! - We throw in more or less cards.  We tend to do one suit per person playing but including more would make it easier to find that one card you are looking forI love how you can tailor this to your child's level.  It has been so fun to see the equations they come back with.  They literally beg for us to do this and I love how they are working on quick math recall....  and simple equations!The ink on the cards is starting to wear off in some places  but we've already used them so much we don't even care.  They have been well worth the price for what we've used them for.  Cheaper than a math workbook and much more fun!As other reviewers have already stated, they are stiff when right out of the package but they do loosen up and become easier to play with outside of the water.  Just realize these are more plastic than paper so will feel different than traditional playing cards.",

The tape is pretty stretchy so you don't need a lot. Underestimate the length you need and it'll stretch to exactly where it needs to go.

As you position the tape over your breast, gently remove the protective paper.My only complaint but more so on my part, I fell asleep with the tape on after a night of partying and woke up with some skin irritation. I removed the tape too quickly and a piece of my skin came off...ouch. I'd recommend removing immediately when you get home and maybe some baby oil to lubricate your skin so you don't get bruises when taking them off. Definitely ordering another roll though.",

They have a sticky adhesive but it's not super strong so  doesn't hurt to take off. - Lines on the back of tape so you know exactly how long to cut for each strip to be even - Held up to dancing and a night on the town (6-8 hours) Could definitely go longer. - Does not hurt to remove. It's not completely painless but it's easy. Like a band-aid.Cons: - Leaves a slight sticky residue after removal - I was able to get 4 uses out of the roll. Again, I have D cups and each strip was long enough to cover about an  inch under my boob to around an inch over my shoulder. I used 2-3 strips per boob per use. Make sure you  order more than 1 if you plan on using often. - This isn't really a con but you have to be very careful when applying. The adhesive is very sticky and if you  peel the back of the tape too fast or don't apply slowly, the tape stretches so it will retract and expand,  sticking to itself.",

I take my Fibbit out while I take a shower and gently wipe them both off afterwards and let them dry.  The reason I do this is because the opening where the Fitbit goes can smell due to moisture getting into the opening.  I discovered that shortly after receiving the Fitbit and didn't want to take a chance of it smelling again. I charge the Fitbit about once a week.  When removing the device and putting it back into the band, I'm extremely gentle since I know how they split.  Five months is not very long to be wearing these bands and having them continuously break.  I love my Fitbit Flex but am considering buying a different device with the hope the band lasts longer.

I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.",

            "Content": "  Pros:__________• It's very comfortable. When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn't bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.• The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it's almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.• I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.• The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.• The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).• Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you're able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.• I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.• The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you “actually” have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it's within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.• The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn't new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You'll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.• Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It's hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit's friendly visual graphs, you don't have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.• Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.• One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I'm a huge fan of this because you're not wearing the watch every second of your life. It's nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.• Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don't use Uber, but it's good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.• Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It's also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.• Yes, you can swim with it. Haven't tested this out though.• Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I'm using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________• There is a connectivity issue that I'm dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it's doing this  but I've noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.• Another issue with the connectivity is you won't know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.• On the display, I felt Fitbit's main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don't use this device often you're going to be lost in there OS.• You're paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly “Premium” services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don't want to pay a monthly payment then you're stuck with the “basic” software of the watch.• No idea why Fitbit did this but you can't stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can't even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.• Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you'll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa's answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.• To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon's Alexa's app on the phone and have an account with it.• No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.• No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn't find it to be that much off, but it's enough that I think you should know.• Has some thick bezels around the screen.• If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.• I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it's a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.• Currently I can't respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.• I notice that Fitbit doesn't have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you're going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn't an issue but it's something to note in the long run due to security reasons.• You can't even store your favorite apps for quick access.• Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.• When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you're going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you're not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.• Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It's not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It's a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you're only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it's one of the few devices that can visually show you that you're improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it's not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn't. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium “monthly” services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn't useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn't in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you're looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn't.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer",

Nice.1 star for everything else. #1 complaint would be the lack of jokers. Pretty inexplicable and annoying.Beyond that, I'm not a fan of the packaging/housing. I like to carry playing cards in my bag, but space is at a premium so I was hoping to find something that would occupy a little less real estate than a standard deck. I have tried those \"mini\" cards which are normally proportioned cards, but miniaturized to around a 50% scale. Those are fine in a pinch, but I found the full-size height of these cards very appealing. So I was disappointed to discover that both of these slim-packs are designed to live together permanently in the plastic case they come in -- I guess I assumed they would be packaged in individual cartons inside this case, but in fact the cards are loose inside and the 2 decks are separated by a (slightly too short) plastic divider. The plastic case is actually slightly LARGER than a standard deck, so definitely not a space-saver.So this 2-pack concept is not what I was looking for, packaging-wise. Which is fine -- not everyone's use case is the same as mine -- but I still find the design disappointing and impractical in general, because once you've removed the shrink-wrap that keeps them tightly bound, the 2 slim packs don't actually tuck very easily into the case. The process of trying to seat them neatly into their respective compartments and then close the case is just more fiddly than I'm willing to deal with (hur hur) on a regular basis -- not the biggest hassle in the world, but more annoyance than I would want to encounter from a deck of cards that sees regular use.All that said... I DO like the card design quite a bit, so what I'll probably do is DIY my own little box for one of the packs so that I can carry around a single one of these \"skinny\" packs. With that done I'll be pretty satisfied.Update: Google \"Super Deluxe Tuckbox Template Maker\" to find a very convenient generator that will help you make a custom tuckbox to fit this and other odd-sized decks. Huzzah! (Thanks to Craig Forbes & Elliott Evans)Final note: the box claims that these are easy to shuffle, so I'll briefly comment on that -- I'm a merely-competent shuffler but I can confirm that riffle shuffling is indeed easy with these. Hindu shuffling is more awkward, requiring a modified grip to keep from dropping cards, but that's just a matter of practice and building some new muscle memory.",

The different band colors are great for mixing up colors.  I think it is SOOOO cheap of Fitbit to market a 3 pack of bands with one clasp.  The generic, aftermarket brands use watch clasps which makes them unattractive.  I was happy to pay for the brand name at $10/band or $30 for a 3 pack.  For that amount, each band should have a clasp with it.  The clasps are very difficult to remove because they are supposed to stay in place.  So the bottom line, Fitbit produces 1/3 of the cheap clasps, saves themselves money, but still sticks it to the consumer with a high-priced 3 pack to buy their product.  It states it in the description there is one clasp, but it's still really, really bad business.  Consumers will pay for the brand name.  Don't be so cheap that each bracelet isn't ready to be used with its own clasp.  It takes enough time slipping the Fitbit in and out of the band.  Really, really disappointed in Fitbit sticking it to the consumer.",

I called FitBit, and they led me through a process to remove the device, reset it, then add it, and this worked....for about an hour, then I once again got the 50% progress bar showing on the display. I called FitBit back, and they said there is nothing more they can do - the product is broken. They offered me a 25% discount on a new device, but how inclined do you think I am to buy a FIFTH FitBit product, based on the absolutely horrible quality I've seen with the first four?The tech support dude said they've improved the quality....WELL WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG, and IF YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH QUALITY, WHY AM I GOING TO HAVE TO BUY YET ANOTHER BRAND NEW PRODUCT?Original review: This is the fourth FitBit I've owned. The previous three were FitBit Flex's and all three suffered the same fate - the electronics detached from the band. In each case, FitBit replaced the faulty unit with a new one.All in all, I like the way they operate and how the FitBit's work, so I've remained loyal. In October of 2015 I decided to buy another one, and this time it was a Charge HR. Unfortunately, the back of the electronics case popped open last week, and I'm going to have to Super Glue it together, in much the same fashion as the last 3 Flex's I've had.How hard is it to make a product that, when used as designed, actually last longer than 18 months? Yes, I wear it every day, and most nights, but I don't wear it swimming, or in the shower, or while washing my car, doing dishes, etc...in other words, it's on my wrist but not exposed to any harsh conditions...and still, it's falling apart in the same way as earlier versions.It's out of warranty, so I'm stuck fixing it myself, or buying a replacement.Oh, and BTW, why is the Charge HR the ONLY FitBit that doesn't have the ability to show the battery level on the device's screen? You need to get this info from the app. Ironic that the Charge does not SHOW its charge, no?",

There are no buttons just to turn it on, you just finger touch both sides.  Obviously you flex your wrist all day.

(read cons for why I still can't go without my phone) The GPS lost signal during a portion of my run my run..... My phone still had good signal, so not sure why the Versa lost GPS signal. It wasn't for a long period of time (maybe a 0.10 of a mile?), but still disappointing.* SpO2 % - Pretty cool that it can track this....but it only gives a range from when you are sleeping. No way to spot check this. Cannot figure out why they didn't make this possible.* The flat back - the Versa line is the only fitness/smartwatch I have been able to tolerate. I despise the raised round backs of so many others. The back of this watch causes no discomfort.Cons:* No music storage - wth Fitbit?!?! So you added GPS, but took away music storage. Major design flaw. It can only stream music when connected to a phone via Bluetooth, so I *still* must take my phone on runs with me. This is the reason I am returning the watch.  ***EDIT*** - So....you can store music for offline use *ONLY* if you subscribe to Deezer or Pandora. So, It will cost at $10/month to store music. Spotify will only allow to to control the music from the watch, but doesn't allow for offline music. You can't upload your own music to the watch.* SpO2% - like I mentioned above, there is no way to spot check this. I would love to see what happens with my SpO2 during runs, when I go up to higher altitude and workout, etc. But, nope, it only tells me about the values from when I was asleep. *eyeroll*I am going to try the new Garmin Venu Sq Music Edition and hope the back of it is not as uncomfortable as I have experienced with other similar watches. It is about $20 more but can do all the things that the Versa 3 can do PLUS the things the Versa 3 can't. Onboard music storage, and spot checking SpO2. I'll miss the Fitbit communities and my familiarity with the Fitbit platform.",

Not the end of the world but worth mentioning. In addition, the charger connectss but I am have to disconnect and reconnect several times in order for it to charge. There has been at least 2 times where it wouldn't and I threw it in a drawer and gave up. Second, the stupid proprietary band keep failing. I have gone through at least 1 set every 2-3 weeks because the weird connecter fails and the band no longer works. It seems Fitbit is still almost a good watch after my ionic and versa experience. Hopefully the Google acquisition will correct the remaining issues...Background:I had the Ionic for about 2 years and we all know how that went. When it worked it was great but it had its flaws. My first Ionic lasted about 5 mons. and Fitbit sent me a replacement that lasted another 18mons. That Ionic died at the end of July 2020. So I made a big upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 which with tax set me back almost $500. After a month I absolutely hated it and was sick that I spent so much. I couldn't get more than a day of battery life, it was uncomfortable and honestly I just don't see what extra value it adds over a Fitbit type smart watch. What was worse was after 1 month the watch was marked down about $75 and the resale value was only around $275. So I lost my shirt on that watch....Review:So after dumping the GW3, I opted for the Versa 3 over the Sense as I don't think the extra sensor is worth the premium for my use case. Still has built in GPS which is great and everything I know and love from fitbit. In spite of all the negative reviews for this watch I think it is amazing. The display is bright and smooth, its comfortable, and there may be a tiny lag in the OS but its a FITBIT so honestly, it isn't like it freezes constantly it is just a small infrequent hiccup. Which my $500 GS3 did as well. Most important, I dont need to keep a charger with me at all times as I can get a solid 5 days off of a charge +/- depending on GPS use etc. So for those fitbit lovers who want to upgrade or for those who want a reasonable smart watch or fitness tracker this is for you. Is it a GS3 or Apple watch, No. But IMO, it isn't trying to be something its not. You don't need a bunch of Apps of games on your watch. That is what your $1000 phone is for. A watch is a tool to complement your phone. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy it.",

Basically, if you are lying awake, but your heart rate and breathing are slow (which they tend to be if you were sleeping and then wake up), it thinks you are asleep. So I can lie in bed awake for hours but the Versa says I got 8 hours of sleep.Running is a disappointment too. There is no quick button to pause your time (if you are at a stoplight, crosswalk, etc) and so you have to get the display on and then try to swipe down to get the right screen and push pause with your sweaty hands (which doesn't always work).Also, there is no interval tracker like the Garmin. You can set the Garmin to run any interval you want, and the default interval is 1 mile. So every 1 mile (or whatever interval you have set, and you can also set in km), it lights up so you can see it, beeps to let you know to look, and shows your mile pace, whole distance, whole time, etc. Really helpful!!! There is no way to do this on the Fitbit. You have to swipe through multiple screens (again with the sweaty fingers) and its very small type to try to see your details.Wish I had bought another Garmin. It may be okay if you're not a runner, but as a runner, this is NOT the smart watch to get.",

The adhesive ends are similarly flimsy, thin material, and it shreds into many smaller pieces when you attempt to remove the \"band-aid\", such that you're forced to scrape them off your skin one by one.  I've never encountered a \"band-aid\" this laughable in my entire life.  These things are unusable - all 5 boxes are going straight into the trash.I can't believe these are made by Johnson & Johnson.  I think they're just one more cheap Chinese knockoff we're seeing so much of today.  Box says \"Made in Brazil\", but so what?  Would a knock-off artist lie?  Duh... SMHI also question the legitimacy of all the glowing 5-star \"reviews\".

The device I bought stopped working after 6 months. [Update: Fitbit sent me a replacement product, which  stopped working after less than five months].Customer service is terrible:- replacement for products under warranty take weeks to arrive (minimum “5 to 10 business days”)- Fitbit replaces defective products not with brand new items, but with refurbished pebbles (which won't last very long, given that even brand-new products break down after 6 months)- The warranty on the replacement items is only for the duration of the warranty left on the original product, rather than a new one-year warranty, which is standard practice for other companies. (this show the very poor confidence Fitbit employees have in their own products!)- It takes days to receive answers from customer support.- There is no compensation for customers who have to deal with defective products. Not even an apology.Overall, Fitbit's policies are excellent at protecting themselves against the poor quality of their own products, but they are much less effective at protecting the rights of their customers.The only good thing I can write about this product is that the Fitbit Alta HR is discreet and relatively elegant, and it gives the time accurately.But given that that this tracker fails to perform appropriately all of the basic functions for which we may decide to buy it, including step tracking, heart rate tracking, and calorie tracking, we're be better off with no device at all (more discreet), a standard watch (more elegant), or a tracker from another brand like Garmin or Omron (more accurate).",

This is contrary to what online support says regarding the few extra steps that may be recorded. So there was always a question of how many steps I had taken in a day. I discovered also that it would not record my stationary bike activity. I ride it daily since my hip replacements for 10plus miles. If there was a way to manually add the activity, I could not locate it in the Inspire on line app. And after searching on line help, I discovered the limitations of this Fitbit model. For example, with more expensive Fitbits, spinning is a menu selection, which can be used to imitate stationary bike activity. Unfortunately this was not a menu selection for the Inspire I had.  At $80.00 it was too expensive given the difficulty I was having with it.  Spending more for a fancier Fitbit with a band that was easier to close didn't appeal to me. So I returned it.",

The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It's supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I'll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won't make the same mistake.",

You have a defective watch band and this units are failing at an alarming rate.I've been a long time Fitbit customer, so I really want to say good things here.  I've bought other Fitbits before (starting with the Fitbit one) as well as many other models for most of my family, but this model is defective.  The bands either break, crack or the newest problem is they bubble and then peal away from the main body.  Your expensive smart watch won't last a year.  I'm on my third Surge now, which Fitbit has sent to replace the first two.  Which would make you think, hey they're making this right.  Well you'd be wrong.  The Fitbit has a one year warranty, which does not extend when they send you a replacement.  In my case, they sent me a replacemention just a few months ago and now it's strap is pealing off!  But they won't replace their brand new three month old watch because the original warrranty is now expired.  That means if that watch is defective you have to hope that happened soon or you'll be stuck with $300 smart watch that won't stay on your wrist.  And again. Three months, third watch.  There is clearly a design problem with these.In short: don't buy.  Your watch will last about a year, then fall off your wrist and even the support people at Fitbit know to just send you a new watch.  But only within that first 12 months, and your watchs strap will fail I'm afraid,  When it happens with the replacement watch they send you, Fitbit won't do anything about this design flaw.  Seriously, how does a watch strap fail?  I've got watches from 30 years ago that haven't broken.  This is just shoddy.  Check the Fitbit forums, it's filled with owners complaining about this and again, you're stuck with it.  And to add insult to injury, if you ask for their help, they'll \"helpfully' offer you a discount on a different Fitbit (Seems like they know these units are defective).  Very very frustrating.",
