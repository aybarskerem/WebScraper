So, upon examining I noticed the pump belt had burned out. So I ordered this product via Prime - it arrived promptly, and in excellent condition. Belts were sent in a simple envelope. I ended up replacing both old belts on my PROHeat, because the other belt that had not yet busted was pretty stiff.This belt change should only take you 15-20 minutes, maybe even faster. I attached a \"how-to change the belts in a PROHeat Cleaner\" video for my review, so you can see the actual packaging, the belts, and the actual changing of both belts. If I had had the video I made, I could probably have changed this in 5 minutes or less! Great product so far, and my Bissell ProHeat now functions perfectly!\n"

I had a dog and over the years that thing cleaned up mud, urine, a wine spill, aquarium leaks,  my own blood after a nasty gash that required stitches and so? I loved the first one so much? I bought a 2nd one when that one wore completely out. So to my horror after about 3 years? It quit on me I was really mad because I spent about $200.00 on the new machine. I was just about to take it to Goodwill when I realized that MAYBE it had a belt on it that wasn't turning the brush (just like my vacuum cleaner doesn't work when the belt breaks) So? I got on YOUTUBE and found that YES it quits working when the belt does break.  AND not only does it have ONE BELT? but TWO belts and it's good to go ahead to replace both at the same time. SO! I watched YOUTUBE a couple times and ordered a couple new belts AND got out my trusty screw driver and got to work. I am just a middle aged woman that really doesn't  have any mechanical expertise at all, but I watched the YouTube one more time and got that sucker's belts changed and turned it on.and yep! works like new! So I give 5 stars. Especially since I paid about $6.00 for 2 belts vs. $200.00 for a new machine! No complaints here!\n"

I purchased the two belts here on Amazon for the lowest price I could find.  One belt drives the water pump and the other belt has grooved teeth and spins the sweeper.  Installed in under 10 minutes.  Fired up the carpet cleaner and it works like new!!  I almost threw it in the trash thinking I needed to spend $300 for a new model.

In hindsight, I know it just needed a dang belt.Anyways, these are just as described. I can't vouch for the belt that's not the brush belt (the brush belt is the one with teeth on the inside) but the brush belt is perfect and my scrubber is back in commission. Be careful when you put this on though. Bissell didn't make these things very durable to begin with, so it wouldn't take much to break it if you don't put it on just right.If it's belts you need, these are great!

When we clean doggy messes, sometimes the steam cleaner gets clogged. Nothing fits in those crannies: wire, wire hanger, brushes, nothing. This tool made removing clogs simple, easy, and FAST.

When 1 thing is bad it's not that hard to fix but when 3 or 4 problems exist at once  it really becomes quite a task. You'll be pulling your hair out after putting it together and tearing it apart over and over  you can't test them unless they are put back together.

Most simy just aren't worth fixing. None are worth paying to have it fixed, but I think the repairs are beyond most owners capabilities unless you have dealt with them quite a bit. Even after many years of fixing these I find myself thinking that I shouldn't even waste my time fixing it since they are so problematic that the repair will be futile or might not matter since so many other problems can pop up overnight.

Here is another tip. if you need new belts,...well its time to clean the red nozzles too. they should unclip from their hoses (under the main tanks) and then drop them in a very hot bottle of water (filled 3/4) and shake the bottle. you will likely see calcium scale come out of them.

After further inspection I noticed the red gasket had  disintegrated.I noticed the detergent reservoir had a funny smell, I then found out that after my neighbor had used up all the detergent, they used vinegar instead, and they put the carpet cleaner away with vinegar still in the reservoir.Thankfully It was an easy fix, thanks Amazon having this part available.I just hope that I don\u2019t find out later that something else in the carpet cleaner has also been compromised by the vinegar, so I\u2019m crossing my fingers.The moral to this excruciatingly long story is to don\u2019t be neighborly, lol.Im happy with my purchase, I\u2019m definitely ordering another one for backup, thank you.\n"

For under $10 and 5 minutes of time involved, it's fixed. The install requires you to remove the 4 screws on the top of the unit that are under the tanks, which allows the entire top panel of the unit to come off.

He gets right down to the nuts and bolts with a few helpful hints in taking the machine apart and putting it back together.  It can be done in 5 minutes or less.  Apparently this flow indicator has a tendency to fail (mine failed after 5 yrs) due to using burning hot water that causes the indicator to crack or come apart at the seams, which is exactly what I had done to damaged my indicator.

The filters, while working well, are poorly designed. Here's what I mean:  as you can see in the photo, the filter comes in two parts, a mesh screen and a thick accordion filter.  The screen can be washed in warm soapy water and likely would last for a good time.  The white filter, however, cannot be washed.  All you can do is wipe it clean and that leaves something to be desired.  I suppose that, if I was only using this thing on pet hair and spots, it might be fine.  But the vacuum is such a little powerhouse that I've also used it to vacuum drapes, upholstery and crevices.  Lots of fine dust, which seems to breed in my house.  As a result, I've had to replace the filter assembly more frequently than I had originally thought.  Bissell should consider selling the two pieces individually.\n"

It is. The vacuum is cheap, and it works; just try to take care of it. Once is starts being different than usual, look for the problem; you don't want to render it entirely useless because of some extra melting in there.Brush: 5 starsVacuum: 3 starsP.S. - The cause of the melting was a little metal piece that turned fast enough to melt the plastic that wasn't turning with it because of too much hair clogging.

It actually smells really good and has just the right amount of intensity though that smell does start to fade about 20-30 days of heavy use but this seems more to do with the fact that we have dogs and odors that come with pets. I believe the smell would last longer without it having to filter dog odors.If I had to come up with a true con it would be the fact that you can get 4 non scented knockoff filters for the cost of this Febreze filter. So if you don't care for a scented filter, you can certainly get cheaper elsewhere. If you do want or need a scented filter, this one is hard to beat and works extremely well.\n"

Over time, barely any air blew out the bottom of the canister and suction performance decreased significantly. After installing this, my vacuum works like new again. The airflow is back to its original state and suction power has returned.

To minimize the amount of dust this filter collects, you should wash/replace the pre-motor filters. I have 2 reusable/washable pre-motor filters for my vacuum and I clean them out once a month. However, I seldom vacuum so if you clean more often, you should maintain the filters frequently. I believe this filter should be replaced at least once a year, but you should look to your respective owner's manual for specifics.Like an older review mentioned, it took some effort putting the filter in because it may be a little warped but it did fit and now it's a tight seal so dust does not sneak out. This filter is great so far, and for such a good price. I ended up buying a few more. Also, I posted some pictures of what I got. Apparently it's not made by Bissell, and I could not find any manufacturing information on the packaging or on the filter itself. It doesn't matter much to me so I won't dock any stars from this.\n"

You open the filter housing, pop out the old filter and pop the new one in.  It fits snugly, but it is easy to install.  It is important to remember to also pull out and clean the sponge-type filter located on the front of the sweeper under the dirt canister.

What always gives out is the hose, it tends to develop a hole either up by the handle or down by the connection to the unit.  This of course is is you use the hand attachment a lot like we do. After using the auto clean feature, I like to use the wand to suck up the excess water the auto setting misses.  The carpet drys a lot quicker if you do.  The install of the new hose is pretty simple.  I've added some photos to help you out. You will need a Phillips screw driver to remove 4 screws to take the top off. After the screws are off the top lifts up but be careful there is a ribbon cable attached to the control panel.  I just unplugged it and set the top aside.  Next, with some pliers or similar, pinch the spring clamp from the small hose and slide it up the hose.  Pull the small hose off the fitting.  I found this to be the tricky part, it's on there pretty good.  I ended up cutting the hose up a few inches and tugging it off with some pliers.  (save the little spring clamp you will need  to transfer it to the new hose)  Next you can lift the large hose's plastic end up a little and tug it out of it's holder.  It's just pressed in place.  Now fit the new part right where the old one was, remember to put the spring clamp on the small hose before fitting it on the barbed connection. Plug the ribbon cable back in and place the top part on and screw it back down.  Pretty simple and good as new.  A lot cheaper than a whole new unit for about 15 minutes work!  See photos they should help (I hope)\n"

Then you pull the old hose up and left-out of the housing. There is also a small rubber feeder hose attached. For that you have to pinch a metal clip holding it a little deeper in the bottom body and then pull the old hose off. Then slide the new house on and pull the clip over it to hold it tight.

The hose broke off almost completely -- dry rot (I live in the Mojave Desert and stuff dries out). The only thing holding it on was the water supply tube.I started pricing out a new Spot Bot (cha-ching!) and decided to try to fix it myself.  Other than the hose, almost everything else looked fine. (The dirty water tank was gross so I replaced that as well.)  I bought the parts here on Amazon because when I shopped around the prices were about the same, considering shipping (I have Prime). Make sure you get OEM parts.There are several YouTube videos that show you how to make the repair. I used the video by Performance Reviews entitled \"Bissell Spotbot 33N8 Hose Replacement Repair\". You need a flat surface, Phillips screwdriver, needlenose pliers, a bottle of 409 and a bunch of paper towels. Might as well do a good clean of the unit if you're going to have it all apart. And I needed to remove dirty water around some of the screws anyway.The new hose works great.Tip: When you have it all torn open and you're trying to squeeze the new tube onto the nipple, dip the end of the tube in some warm water to make it a little more pliable (or chew on it a little in your mouth -- it's brand new and clean).\n"

The latter two help with removing the little clamp for the waterline, and then the waterline itself. I googled it and that's how they did it in the YouTube video.Took about 10 minutes to replace from start to finish.Thanks to the other posters for the tip to NOT wrap the hose around the Spotbot for storage. I always found that nearly impossible with an extremely tight fit. So I never used the hose for cleaning, because it was cumbersome to put it back, plus it had gotten stiff over the years. It never occurred to me to just leave it loose. Now I use the hose for cleaning all the time. Great timing for hairball season.Now I make it drink a clean glass of water and rinse out the grey tank immediately after use. Since I also replaced the grey tank, all the stinky smells are now gone and it's like having a brand new SpotBot.\n"

Add to my hair, we have a black lab/Shepard mix whose fur could make a litter of puppies every day. Yes, that is after brushing. I also have an almost 3 year old and a 1 year old so crumbs and messes are a constant battle as well as hawaiin red dirt. Our floors are also grooved, not our choice, so dirt and crumbs get in there and are hard to get out. This brush, so far, functions better than the original in the no tangles sense and it gets in the grooves better as well.Cleaning it is easier without having to get hair off of it and slightly easier than the original. At least for me. I am going to start replacing my extra original brushes for these though! Total mom lifesaver!\n"

It fits the vacuum hose & the few tools I have, snugly although it's a push-on fit.  So far (a week or so) it stays extended when tightened in that position, though it is a bit difficult to tighten well enough.  It does what it's supposed to do, and it's super-cheap.Extended, this is not quite as long as I expected, for some reason:  it's 27.5\" end-to-end when fully extended.  And I have no idea why neither this seller, nor Bissell itself, provides that critical piece of information in the product description.But 27.5\" turns out to be just long enough for me to reach the blades of the ceiling fans when combined with the vacuum hose.

Unlike a pump that's a pain in the butt on your hand, and sometimes can fail. I've tried plenty of other products, and I might as well have put my money in the shredder. If you drink coffee or red wine, do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get this. Inevitably, you get what you pay for, and you end up using less because the formula is so effective. Bissell products in general I find to be very good. I used their carpet shampoo with a little cap full of  their Power Boost formula, and my carpeting looks a shade lighter after I'm finished!

I have had to use it more often than I would like (thanks, cat) but I no longer fear cleanup as much as I used to.  I follow the directions, and it works.  I do wish the spray were a little wider -- it's a narrow stream, so sometimes it takes quite a bit of spraying to completely cover a stain.  And the scent is stronger than I like, though I do tend to be sensitive to scents; if I get any on my hands, it lingers and requires a lot of scrubbing.

          "\n  It feels like I've tried EVERY pet stain removal product on the market. You can't even imagine how happy I was when I FINALLY found this one  . . . BECAUSE IT GETS THEM OUT! Stains usually disappear with one use.  If I have a really tough stain or don't find one until the next morning, I use the product twice, if needed.Years ago I purchased new carpet for my main floor & basement because I had no choice. The sweet senior Greyhounds I adopt have accidents sometimes and, before I knew it, the new carpet wasn't looking so good. That's because none of the products I used on them worked. Even professional carpet cleaners couldn't remove some of the stains! That left me thinking I would NEVER get them out (sad face). With use of this Bissell product, my carpets look brand new again! Later, when my sister & friends would visit, they couldn't believe they were looking at the same carpet. And, trust me, they would have said something if they saw little or no change. While I wouldn't have liked hearing what they said, I would have appreciated their honesty. And, I'd keep working on a solution.I read some of the reviews of the Bissell Pet Power Shot Oxy. I'm sharing my experience with it & giving a few suggestions that I hope you find helpful.- The solution comes out of the container FAST, UNDER PRESSURE & in a VERY narrow stream.  As you hold the container a bit higher, the narrow stream becomes stronger. This is done to GET THE PRODUCT into your carpet AND, INTO THE PADDING. ( a spray would not do this). URINE WILL SOAK INTO AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE CARPET STAIN & FURTHER INTO THE PADDING. APPLY THE PRODUCT IN THESE AREAS, TOO.  If you don't, THE REMAINING URINE WILL LEAVE AN ODOR. NOT GOOD!- The can is empty before you know it for reasons mentioned above. That's no problem for me because it is such a great product at, what I consider, a fair price. And, IT WORKS, unlike so many other pet stain removers.- When I first shopped for the Bissell stain remover, I went to Lowes & paid close to $15 for one can. I had been told how good it was, so I thought I should still try it. Later, I SHOPPED AROUND because prices can vary considerably in stores & on-line.- I purchase large amounts of this pet stain remover at a time. I want it in my house in case I need it, because local stores may not have it. And, I don't want to wait until it's sent to me the next day.~ THE END ~\n"

I almost welcome being woken up in the middle of the night with the rhythmic sounds of the dog gagging up his dinner.Seriously, if you have a pet, but a can of this for each year you expect it to be alive, just in case they ever change the formula or make something \"better.\" That's why I've now purchased 85 cans, since I assume my dog will long outlive me.Now if I could just potty train him so he doesn't poop on the bathroom floor.\n"

Cats never use toilet paper when they have an...irregular BM. They (unfortunately for you, them and the carpet) end up using the carpet for the above mentioned things. And really, it's not like we can blame them. That's where this stuff comes in. It has gotten \"skid marks\"  (...oh, you know of what grossness I speak of...), vomit and hairball stains, AND odors out of our off-white carpet (not our color choice, we live in an apartment). I don't care if a can doesn't last very long. It's magic. You can't expect magic in a can to last a long time. You spray and grossness comes out. Stains burned in by stomach acid come out! This is how magical it is: you spray the super strong stream of foam on the stained area, wait 5 minutes and then blot, blot, blot. I have my husband dance on the spot. (Blotting by boogie.) It may take a little elbow grease - or in my husband's case, fancy footwork - but it comes out! Odor and all! Even on older stains, that we used the Bissell spot bot on previously, that didn't completely come out, this stuff worked! That's how magical it is! If you had a magic lamp with a genie and you rubbed it each time your cat/dog did The Scoot or threw-up, you'd only get three wishes, right? (And no wishing for more wishes or any of that stuff; or wishing for your beloved furry friend to stop using the carpet as toilet paper, because you know the genie would try to twist if around on you by having Rover or Fluffy use something else as toilet paper. Genies are just that way...) So, with this can, you still get more out of it! Definitely more than three uses - I think ours lasted for a few months - and no genie trying to play tricks on you. See?

So look at your serial number. Mine was 152xxxxx and the change happened at 160xxxxx, so I used to older one. The newer one say's \"deeper grooves\", but since you don't have them side by side to compare, you need to use the serial number.My belt started smoking, and upon disassembly, discovered the roller had seized up. The part that was supposed to turn freely wouldn't budge with channel locks. The new roller turned easily, but the belt was damaged beyond repair and broke.Part two: New belt.Dear Bissell, it doesn't help to say, \"Uses style 7,9,10,12,14,16.\" when my vacuum has no indication what \"style\" it is!  How about you add a mark on the serial number plate that says \"style 7 belt\"?After an hour of research and a trip to the big box store I had two new belts for under $5. (sorry, Amazon, I wanted to get it back together quickly)While I'm on a rant, why can't manufacturers use standard sizing? Many vacuums use common 1 1/4\" accessories, not Bissell or Shark.

But the machine came with a small bottle of the same type cleaner that was 4x, while this is 2x, so I figured it should work.It's not real clear how much to add so I sort of went on the low side to use for cleaning a recliner chair that was generally dirty with a few spots/stains which you can see in the pictures. The chair came out great. I needed to go back over it a second time once it dried to get the stained areas cleaned, but that is more about not being able to tell how well it looked when it was still wet. The chair came out great though. I also used it to clean some spots on some low pile Berber type carpet and it took them out too no problem.I give a lot of the credit to the machine itself which is awesome, but it need to be paired with the right solution to get the job done and I am confident this stuff worked it's magic. And I did not need to use very much so this big bottle will last me along time. I really can't say much about the \"Oxy\" supplement as I did not compare it to the non-Oxy type cleaner.Overall though it was money well spent and now I have a good supply to last me a long time. If I run across some stains that this does not get out which it is supposed too, I will update this review. For right now though and based on how I used it, I can recommend this cleaner for use in the Bissell SpotClean Professional  Portable carpet cleaner and probably other supported machines too.\n"

My Mom recommended trying Bissell brand, as that's what she uses on her carpets, so I ordered this one with the Oxy Clean additive. I was super impressed with how well it actually lifted dirt and stains out of the carpet, especially in my step-sons room. It seriously revived our carpet.Several months later after purchasing it, right before I went into the hospital to have my son, my step-son fell asleep with a jumbo chocolate caramel strawberry and banana smoothie full right next to him. My curious cat decided she wanted to try some of it, and literally dumped the entire canister onto the floor. It seriously looked like someone had an accident on the carpet. I pulled out my trusty Bissell cleaner, and after 3 separate cleaning sessions, it pulled all of that nasty brown stain out of the carpet! I couldn't believe it!

The only problem (and it's one I've learned to live with) is the filter system, which gets easily clogged with dust and grime.  You have to clean the filters regularly, and they have to be TOTALLY DRY before you replace them in the vacuum.

I tested it in front of a mirror, so I could see which way picked up the most water.To all the people who complain about their green machine not picking up enough water, do not push down hard thinking it will pick up more.  You have to let the head lightly go over the carpet, and don't be in a hurry.  Trust me, it works!  I use one tank of cleaning solution, and I get 3/4's of tank of dirty water back.Think about a regular upright vacuum, do you push it hard into the floor when using it, or do you just let it glide over the carpet...Unless you want forearms like Popeye, use it like you would a floor vacuum & it will pick up a lot of water.\n"

This is the best steam Mop I have ever used and I have bought 2 different types of Shark steam Mop from Target , 2 different types of Hoover steam mops and an Oreck steam Mop online. This particular Bissel steam Mop, steam cleans the floors better than any of them, it is so easy to use. I didn't find the water cap on the Mop to be flimsy as other reviews have said. I like the clean but not overpowering scent from the scent disks that you insert inside of the Mop too. I bought this model because you can use it as a hand held steam cleaner for counter tops, etc. The steam coming out of this as a floor Mop is more powerful and better evenly distributed than the other models I have used in the past, including as a hand held steamer too. The long cord can be awkward at times as a hand held steam cleaner, but I prefer the longer cord, you don't have to keep plugging it into different outlets as you move around the room you are cleaning. It is so light and easy to lift as a Mop or hand held. I have linoleum floors throughout 1/2 of my home, the linoleum is made to look like wood floor panels and although it produces a strong current of steam and really cleans the floor, it does not damage the linoleum.\n"

I prefer white and either solid colors or very simple designs (I don\u2019t need wild and crazy prints or neons... I actually enjoy when the colors blend in with the style of my home) and these deliver on the looks front as well. Having the extras means that when one is in the wash I have a back up in case of an unexpected spill or accident (bound to happen with a baby, pets and a husband!) or when I do a deep clean of the whole house I can designate one for the bathrooms, one for the kitchen and then one for the other rooms.

After cleaning the carpet on my stairs, where the Proheat accessory tool was used, the cleaner worked fine.  About a week later, I decided to clean my living room carpet.  Neither the accessory brush nor the floor unit would spray.  After some aggravating time taking the unit apart, including the water heater, I decided the water pump was the culprit.  After the installation, no joy.  Turned out that the spray nozzles on the accessory and the floor unit both clogged up at the same time.  Cleared them out and the unit was fixed.  Before ordering parts, meticulously clear your spray nozzles and open your water heater to clean out built-up deposits.  These little units are really quite simple and easy to fix if you use your head and go from simple fixes and work your way up (unlike what I did this time).  I hope I have helped someone.

Don't saturate your carpet with shampoo or the carpet will end up looking good for just a day and then attracting dirt and stains with a vengeance.We would clean the carpets of a Fortune 500 company headquarters monthly, and mostly with nothing more than hot water, relying on hot water, residual shampoo from previous applications of shampoo and spot application of cleaning fluid to specially dirty areas to get carpet shiny clean. A very slight use of shampoo is recommended. Better to use shampoo every second or third cleaning (once a year at most) if possible, and only spot clean dirty areas with hand-sprayed shampoo or spot cleaner between shampoo cleanings. Otherwise, stick with hot water. It will do wonders for your carpet\n"

(The most likely culprit is a failed flow indicator, but since I just replaced mine, I knew this wasn't the defective part.)  The solenoid/valve, over time and thousands of actuations, failed to fully close, so that shampoo solution sprayed any time that the machine is turned on.  This was an easy replacement requiring removal of bottom plastic plates, two small hoses, and three wires.  Replacing the valve took about 5 minutes, and it works perfectly: no leaking whatsoever, and full blast when the trigger is pulled.\n"

The BissellAir 320 uses two different filters, however this review and the accompanying photos are referring specifically to the High Efficiency Filter.  The review for the carbon filter is posted separately. This high efficiency replacement filter is a genuine Bissell filter and came in a sealed box from the manufacturer. It was easy to remove the old filter and replace it with the new one.  As soon as both filters were replaced,  I noticed significant improvement in my air quality.  Being that filters have to be replaced approximately every six months, I feel the price is reasonable.  I do recommend checking your filters periodically to get the most benefit out of this purifier.  As you can see in the accompanying photos, this filter does a great job of trapping airborne impurities. I hope my experience, along with the photos, help you out a bit with your choice.

I'll get a stain on it and it won't get cleaned for quite some time until I'm ready to clean the carpets and it comes right out.  On really good stains,  I'll shoot out a little extra cleaner onto the stain and let it soak in a couple minutes and then go over it.  My Carpets almost look NEW even though they aren't.  I'm seeing some of these other pictures and the carpets are nasty.  I would never let my carpets get in that condition.  I'd be embarrassed for anyone coming over and seeing that.I normally go over each section a couple times.  Do my whole house.  Then start all over and just use water.  I always use HOT Water also.  Just using water, I still get more dirt out.  In the end, the carpets are nice and clean.  I make sure I go over them a few times to make sure it sucks up as much water as it can as it'll dry out faster.  I think the Scotch Gaurd helps getting the carpet clean once again.  So you need to use this stuff before the stains are there so that they are scotch guard protected.  Depending on how dirty your carpet is, is what level to set the machine.  A hallway, for example, gets a lot of traffic.  Heavy use!!!  If it's not really that dirty, set it to normal.  Then you don't go through the cleaner so fast.Some people maybe should look at not wearing shoes in the house!!!  I don't know what you're doing to get your carpet so nasty, but this stuff is not a miracle worker.  You have to care a little bit about where you live.  Clean far more often.  Maybe use one of the small machines to clean right away just so the carpet doesn't look like a disaster zone.  Looking not as bad as before is not good.  If should look NEW when done.  If you take care of your carpet, it will last a very long time.\n"

The regular plush carpet in my front entry and living-dining room has been rehabilitated now also.  It had some recurring stains from my Cocker's early mistakes that had me cleaning that carpet about every two months for five years.

On close inspection, it was identical to the part I was replacing that had originally come with the machine.I find that using my Bissell with this attachment does get my tile floors cleaner than when using a mop alone, but it will involve a significantly greater investment of my time than mopping, so I don't use my Bissell to clean my tile every time, just once every couple of months for a good cleaning, with regular mopping in between.As a special note:  While use of the Bissell with this attachment will remove light amounts of dirt from your grout, do not expect this to replace taking a grout brush to your grout lines.Small update: When I went back to look at ordering another replacement so I could have a backup on hand, I noticed the price for this part had increased quite a bit.. so do be careful to do a bit of comparison shopping.\n"

This was exactly what I wanted because I can use my Bissell to clean the entire house and not just my carpet. This really can make your investment in a floor cleaner even more useful. I have a 550 square foot apartment and this tool has made cleaning the kitchen and bathroom a dream. I used vinegar instead of cleaning solution and this mopped the floors better than any traditional mop and bucket. Also the floors were dry after I was done cleaning so my dogs would not track water paw prints through my apartment.\n"

I searched all over the internet - and found that there were replacement parts available from the manufacturer for the \"15-inch roller\" - but before I pulled the trigger I used a tape measure and realized the actual roller piece - though mine was slightly melted from my accident - was nowhere close to 15-inches - more like 14.5-inches. I then searched further - and I tell you this so you don't waste an hour - and found that the part number had been changed over the years along with the spec readout for the measurement. How can a part number change AND the size change AND still be good for the previous models? It doesn't make any sense.I work with part numbers everyday - and I know part numbers come and go - but the item at times can stay exactly the same. So, I took a risk on Amazon - which had the best price (as it typically does) - and it works perfectly. The spacers are correct for the bottom plate - and it runs without making any noise that it didn't make prior to the accident. Don't let the roller size (14.5-inches) confuse you with the size of the \"pick-up\" area the vacuum claims to have (15-inches) - it works.Criticism: My only issue at all is that the roller appears in the picture to be plastic - the one I received was wooden. Which might end up being a benefit FOR ME - since wood doesn't melt. It does however burn. Cross your fingers I don't find out which is worse by making the same mistake again.\n"

This not only does so, it's far more supple and slightly longer so it winds onto its holder far, far easier than the old one. Most heartily recommended!That said, replacing the hose is not at all for the faint hearted! The Bissell has to be almost completely disassembled as the cleaning fluid hose connects deep inside the base of the unit, requiring such disassembly. Fortunately, the Bissell service manual is available on the Web. Unfortunately, I had to drill out a half dozen of the many screws as they were rusted beyond recognition. On reassembly, I replaced them with stainless steel ones so that shouldn't happen again - well worth the dollar or so.At least while doing all this I was able to thoroughly clean the entire unit's interior, hoses, etc. It now works like new which is saying a lot.\n"

The negative reviews initially concerned me, but having used this item for several hours I am very glad I bought it.The word \"turbo\" in its name referrs to the turbine wheel that powers the mechanism.  Don't expect the brush itself to spin at super high speed.  There is a \"gear train\" that converts the high speed of the turbine wheel to high torque to turn the brush.  That is actually exactly what you want - a super fast brush could easily damage your carpet.It is possible to stall the brush, but that only happenened to me once or twice if I held the brush sideways such that the turbine mechanism filled up with water.  When used on a flat surface (stairway carpet) the brush worked flawlessly.  If the brush does stall, simply holding the brush horizontal for a few seconds clears out the excess water and lets it start spinning normally.There is a slide-switch on top of the brush that selects \"suction\" or \"brush\" mode.  In brush mode, there is still ample suction.  Here is what worked well for me:  For each stair step, I first selected brush mode, sprayed water/cleaning solution and moved the brush back and forth until the area appeared clean - most of the dirty water was sucked up in this mode.  Then I switched to suction mode to extract as much additional water and dirt as possible.\n"

You can also spray solution on the surface you\u2019re cleaning  from this attachment as well. Overall, It\u2019s great for spraying solution and loosening dirt  on surfaces, but the suction could be a bit stronger. I recommend having a separate type of attachment with stronger  suction power for better dryer results.

It should be noted that when job is completed, the supply tank is flushed with fresh clean cold water and pumped through sprayer. The suction hose is also subjected to chean water to flush out system. Hose is wrapped and no strain is present.

Makes sense to inject the cleaning solution underneath the mess and suck it up.  Works great even when the mess has partially dried.  The only complaint I have is that there are a couple of places inside of the head where the dog hair accumulates and I can't figure out how to clean it up without disassembling the head.

I\u2019ve used many shop vacs in the past, and have owned many different styles of vacuums in my house.  This particular model is sort of a hybrid of the two, so I took this into consideration.  You can\u2019t really compare it to shop vacs, as it\u2019s clearly listed as a drum vac.  It\u2019s basically a shop vac for people who don\u2019t have a shop.  The 2035M (this model) is exactly what I was looking for.  Not too big; not too small.  All of the important features I was looking for are there, so the pros far outweigh the cons.**PROS:-Not as bulky as standard wet / dry vacs-Thinner hose (I hate those huge hoses on other vacs)\u2026good for cleaning car interior-The assorted attachments (multi-surface tool, wet floor tool, crevice tool, dusting brush,  precision suction tool, upholstery tool, precision blower tool, & 2 detail tools)-The stainless steel retractable extension wand-The place to hook the extension wand onto when not in use-Carry handle for easy transport-Water-resistant cover for the power switch-Has an air flow regulator on the handle to reduce suction power for delicate fabrics-Has a blower function to air up air mattress, pool toys, etc.-Two stage filtration, and filters are easy to access and clean-6.5 ft. hose-19 ft. cord-2 year limited warranty-Great for cleaning vehicles, boats, garages, sheds, houses, apartments, etc.-Perfect size for my shed if I need to use it as a shop vac-It\u2019s stable, and doesn\u2019t tip over easily-Hose locks in place, but still swivels-Multi surface tool has switch to go straight from bare floors to rugs or carpet-Full tank indicator-Fabric storage bag for attachments**CONS:-Thinner hose (could get clogged easily, can\u2019t pick up larger debris)-No place to store tools on the base unit when not in use (only room for dust brush & crevice tool)-No automatic cord rewind-No clean filter indicator-The base unit drum is made of metal, so if it gets dented, the lid might not fit back on-No HEPA filter, so it\u2019s going to expel the really fine particles back into the airIn conclusion, I have to say I\u2019m pretty impressed with it overall, especially for the price.  It does exactly what I need it to do, and has so far exceeded my expectations.  I\u2019ve had nothing but great experiences with Bissell vacuums in the past, and after using this one, I see no reason for that winning streak to stop.\n"

You simply hold onto the top, which acts as a handle, and place them into the pitcher. Similarly, you just hold onto the \"handle\" when you need to remove the filters. Previously, I would struggle to place the filters in and I needed to tip the pitcher sideways in order to replace the filters.I also think that these new filters work better than the previous filters. I've found that I have a lot less black particles in the compartment where the filter is located in the pitcher. It also no longer \"pops out\" when I tip the pitcher to pour out the last drops of water, which had been an issue with the previous filter model. In addition, the water seems to taste cleaner : )The two filters arrived packaged in a small brown box labeled 'Replacement Filters.' I was surprised that they weren't sent in the usual Brita branded packaging, however, upon opening the package I realized that this was a more efficient way to receive the product.

I can drink Philly water unfiltered, perhaps because it's what I grew up on. Some FL water is okay. Iowa City wasn't horrible. But most other Midwest cities I've lived in, I have to go with filtered or bottled. Heck, Milwaukee water actually killed a few people (69 actually). Okay, I'm not paranoid about dying....it's just that the water in some places either has a weird and/or stale taste, or a smell that's off-putting. And if I'm turned off by the city water, I tend to drink way too much juice/bottled tea/soda. So Brita is my friend. I have the big 18 cup pitcher and love it. Drain it at least once a day, with all my water drinking.These Brita filters are a bit different than ones in years past. Same great filtering, just a different design. No need to let your filter soak before using, just rinse it under the tap. And removing it it is a thousand times easier with it's easy-grip top. The contents are (as far as I know), exactly the same, providing you with clean tasting, clean smelling, fresh water.\n"

Brita did succeed in getting water to flow through faster, but it's by no means free-flowing, and it doesn't remove as much as their traditional filters. But it probably does a good enough job that most people will still be happy.First, the flow rate. I'd call it a heavy trickle. It doesn't hold a candle to pouring from a regular pitcher, or the flow from a sink, but it's not bad. I'd say it's about on par with a refrigerator's in-door water dispenser, to give you an idea. It does get significantly slower as the pitcher is getting closer to empty, but that's not a huge deal since you can refill it instantly. I've also noticed the flow rate varies a lot from filter to filter, for what it's worth.As for the filtering performance, it's worth noting that this filters out chlorine, and not really anything else. Does that matter? Probably not. Chlorine is probably responsible for most of the unpleasant taste in municipal water. If that's all you care about, then this will probably do the job (although the traditional filters seem to work slightly better in my experience). If, however, you happen to be in an older building, you might be concerned about other contaminants, like lead or mercury. In that case, this filter won't help you. (What you probably want is Brita's Longlast filter, their only filter that removes lead.)So, are these worth it? Well, if you are chronically forgetful about refilling the pitcher until you're thirsty (or if you have lazy roommates), probably.

The included basic filter fit perfectly (just have to line it up with the notch on the pitcher) after I followed the directions to rinse it under cold running water for fifteen seconds. I could see the carbon dust being washed away in about three seconds. The water tastes great and the pitcher is a good size for one or two people to use on a daily basis. The filter counter obviously doesn't really know how much water has gone through it if you open the lid to refill before the pitcher is emptied. I plan on using my calender as a guide since I know how much water we use on a typical day. I also figure if the water tastes \"off\" it will be time to change the filter. You take the entire lid off to refill, but it comes off and snaps back on easily. The water filters through quickly, but it will take a couple minutes and you will need to fill it up in two batches as you wait for it to filter. The red color goes with our kitchen so I was happy it cost the same as the plain white one after paying an extra $4 for the turquoise one for mom. We're all very happy with both of them.

It's based on the amount if time the canister is tilted to pour.  I had a larger capacity Purr and it was normally accurate based on the the amount of times it was tilted to pour.  I am a heavy user of my Briter (as was I on the Purr) I use the water in my tea pot, to drink or make lemonade.  Overall Brita does taste better, doesn't take forever to filterate into pitcher and it's smaller easier to store and to handle.  The purr was heavier, longer much longer time to filterate, bulky (taking up to much space in fridge) and a ritual to put in a new filter.

If you dropped this I feel confident it would break. That's something to be aware of. It's not as strong as I assumed it would be. If you add too much pressure you can hear the strain of the plastic. Although for $30, I still feel like I got a great deal. The filtering process is very, very slow. I timed how long it takes to filter it and fill it up and it was about 25 minutes. So beware, if you're looking for something quickly filtered and refillable, you might be disappointed. However, I think it's easy to walk away and come back to see it filled. The nozzle pours the water out quickly though. It's just the filtering that is slow while you refill the container. It's fully worth it though and worth every penny. I am satisfied with my purchase. It also fits in my fridge and didn't take up as much space as I assumed it would. I highly recommend this.\n"

Simple as that!First and foremost, THE RESERVOIR DOES COME OUT. It's tight, and it feels like you might crack the plastic if you really start yanking, but it does come out for cleaning. The way I removed it was by tucking the pitcher under my left arm, and with my right thumb and forefinger, I gripped the little recess in the reservoir and wiggled it back and forth while pulling outwards. If the assembly is dry, it will come out just fine. If it's wet, it'll take a little more effort.For people complaining about the filter, I grant that you may have had a lemon, but from what I can tell, most of the issues experienced will be avoided by FLUSHING THE FILTER WITH WATER BEFORE USE, and DISPOSING OF THE FIRST FEW PITCHERS OF FILTERED WATER, as instructed.Follow the instructions, keep it refrigerated, clean it periodically, replace your filters when your water stops tasting filtered, and you are unlikely to have problems.

As for not filtering the water, let me say my sink is underneath a window looking out at my pool.  I very often fill a glass with water and hold it up to the sunlight and the water is crystal clear with nothing floating around in it.  To make the filter work and light to work you have to let it run for 5 minute to blow out debris caused in the manufacturing.  Another problem for no light is probably low water pressure.  The bottom line is I've used this product for the past 10 years and never had a problem.  I tried the Pur system and it kept falling off my faucet.  It worked but it would fall off.

New has the lid moulded  as part of the reservior [both old/new have flap in lid you lift to fill reservior with water]3) Physically smaller & lighter so fits in fridge easier [sorry, forgot the exact measurements of old but empty was ~20% heavier]With old pitcher, due to 1) [slow pour] then tended to tilt pitcher to a steep angle to try to speed it up,resulting in 2) happening even more!The old had one advantage - it has larger capacity [new allows easier overfill to partly mitigate]Compared to some of the other current Brita pitchers, I like that this has a cover over thespout [to prevent debris getting in] and the curved sides look nicer than my old boxy 10 cupperFilterI switched to the blue Brita Longlife filters - unlike the Standard white filters, these claim to filter Lead/Benzene/Asbestosfor the same running cost [they are 3 times as expensive but last 3 times longer].

It also pours with a clean stream of water that makes it easy to fill things and that stream doesn't fall apart as it did on both of my previous pitchers, including the Grand. Finally, there were reviews which warned that the water ran through quickly and so they assumed it wasn't filtering well. I suspect that those users did not line up the notches. When inserting the filter, you have to be careful to line it up correctly, then push it in snugly. Of course, if it's not in all the way and doesn't seal, then yes - it won't work well, but it's easy to do it correctly if you're aware. I recommend this pitcher without reservation!

I've had it for a week and I'm very happy with my purchase.One word of caution, if you put it near the edge so that the spigot is hanging over a shelf, making it possible to hold your glass underneath, be sure that when you close your fridge door, that nothing, such as a door shelf is hitting the spigot. I thought it only worked if you pulled the spigot down, but it also works if you push it back. About 30 minutes after I filed it and put it in my fridge, I came into the kitchen to find water all over my floor and the dispenser was empty. I have a french door fridge which has shorter doors, but deeper door shelves. When I closed the door, I wasn't aware that one of the door shelves was pushing against the spigot, causing the water to come out.

If you do this, you shouldn't have issues removing it later.I've owned several Britas, from the traditional style to the Stream, so I knew what to expect as far as fill time.  I actually replaced my Stream with this as the Stream only seems to filter chlorine.  The longlast filter that came with this pitcher produces as much cleaner tasting water, as do the original white filters.This pitcher does have a wide pour spout with no restriction, but I've had no issue in filling even ice trays.  It just angle it to pour out of one of the corners of the spout.  I do also hold it with one hand, with the other hand on the front of the pitcher, thumb on the lid to keep it secure.  This is especially helpful if there's water in the top filter reservoir.My only con is that it doesn't have an indicating lid like most other models to.  They do supply a sticker for the top with a moveable indicator to remind you when yo change, but I would have preferred the lighted reminder.  I'm not sure why they skipped it on this model given that it's priced the same as the Monterey.

This filter removes a lot of the particles and odor out of our water, so we can enjoy it once again. The only downfall I have is the stupid lid that holds the battery that guesses the months between use.  It keeps falling to the floor, so I removed it as we do not need it anyway.  It measures the time between pushing the reset button approximately  every two months.  We process a lot of water, more than the average family, so we measure by gallons approximately 40 gallons per filter, instead of days.  The quantity of water, this pitcher holds works out better than my last smaller filter, and the filter part does not fall back into our water.  This pitcher has a lip over the filter for better filter placement.  We have used a Brita filter for over 4 years now and they do make long lasting, hard working filters.\n"

Pretty simple.  I went to the local store to check out the selection of command hooks and see which would be best to hang my particular grill tools.  Each command hook has a different shaped and sized tip, and I found the medium wire hooks to be the most adequate for my grill tools.  Problem is, all command hooks come in white and they can stand out like sore thumb against a different color wall/product.  I decided to try and paint the command hooks to match and it worked perfectly.  I simply taped off the metal hook part and sprayed the plastic with two coats of black spray paint.  The paint applied evenly and has stayed on well without any chipping over 3 months outdoors (under a grill cover) and have had no issues peeling off due to the heat.These were great and a very simple solution to hanging grill tools at a total cost of about $5.  Similar char broil branded grill hooks run $15-$20.  Check out the pictures to see how they turned out.\n"

Most of the brooms, hairdryers, bags, towels are all under 3 lbs (which surprised me). 2. The metal tip of the hook is narrow enough to fit most things (including hot water bottles). 3. The (mostly) straight shape of the hook allows the handles of all of my brooms to go on and off easily, without me having to tip the broom to lift it off a hook. 4. The size-large hooks are longer, which means, to take off the top part of the hook assembly (or to remove the hook), there must be at least \u00bd\" of space above the hook assembly. In certain spaces (like in my closets), the bigger hooks simply can't fit.\n"

Be sure you get any dust, dirt, oils, or grease off the wall or, just like tape, they will stick to the adhesive strip and make it less sticky and more likely to come off the wall.When I first tried to hang my spice rack, it fell down within a minute of installation and adding the spices.  When I felt the adhesive, I found spots that seemed less sticky and seamed to have dust on them.  I used straight isopropyl alcohol on my granite back splash to clean it before hanging my spice rack again and this time, they have been up for 2 months without falling!  I did the same thing on my travertine tile inside my shower and use the hooks to hang our Loofas...2 months, even in the shower that sees daily use by two people, in a place that gets wet every time the shower is turned on, they are holding firm!On my walls that had any texture what-so-ever though...they fall right off within hours no matter how light or heavy the load.

Even though this is a behavioral issue if you're a cat parent and the wall behind your litter box has seen better days, throwing up these and a pee pad might be a great option to prevent further damage and stains.I see how these would work great with photos especially in an apartment or a dorm room and if you're the kind of person that likes to hang up fabric on a wall to dress it up then I think these would also work splendidly.

I rent, and living in an old house with plaster walls makes hanging things up a huge hassle.And full disclosure: I *know* this isn't a classy solution but when you're desperate you're willing to try anything :)I use these jumbo slate hooks in my bedroom to hold up a curtain rod! You'll have to get a pretty thin rod for it to sit securely inside of the hook area - the one I purchased was from IKEA and it works great. I wish they made these jumbo hooks in a style that didn't look so... warehouse-y... but honestly I'm so grateful for them that I'll take what I can get.Excellent stick quality, reliable, and have/will buy again.EDITED TO ADD:I wanted to add a little more info on the type of rods that will work with these hooks. In my bedroom I use the IKEA R\u00c4CKA Curtain rod, which is 3/4\" diameter. It sits easily inside of the Command hooks. I used this solution in my living room as well (see second attached photo - don't judge as I'm in the middle of redecorating, ha!) but because this rod was much longer, I used 3 hooks to hold it up. For my living room, I used Threshold\u2122 Industrial Cage Curtain Rod from Target. It is listed as 1\" diameter and fits in the hook, though it does sit a little higher in the hook.Something super important to note is that not many finials will work with these hooks since they sit so closely to the wall. I was disappointed that the pretty globe finials that came with my Target rod set wouldn't work - they were just too big. The finials I got from IKEA did work, however - they were much smaller and lay flat/flush with the wall.Edit 2/24/17: I attached a new picture - months later these are still holding strong with no issues. :)\n"

As you can see in the photograph it can hold fairly large object and has a big enough hook for hanging pretty much everything you want.

You can probably hang havier objects like potted plants or bigger decorations without any issue.

One I use to hang my bathrobe on the back of the door and the others are used to hang up wet towels.These look great! They match the brushed nickel finish on the door hardware in our rooms so they are great. You can feel that they are plastic before you put it up, but once they are up, no one would ever know that they are not more expensive metal hooks.The hooks are great for my bathrobe, towels or to hang up a pair of jeans, or anything really. My bathrobe is thick cotton and can be pretty heavy when wet. I have not had any of these come loose. I will be buying more to replace other hooks I have in the house. A great find and price!From top to bottom the whole thing is about 4\" long. Perfect for the back of a door or any number of places.If you have never used command strip hooks they hold amazingly well, and to remove you just pull down on the adhesive strip that hangs down. When you install them there are too parts. The hanger with the adhesive strip that you apply to the wall, and then once you apply it and hold it in place for 30 seconds the actual hook part that you see slides on it securely. To remove you just slide up to remove and then pull the adhesive tab straight down slowly until it removes the whole thing, with no residue left.The hook comes with an extra adhesive strip in case you decide to paint and need to put it back up, or if you relocate the strip.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks\n"

          "\n  I'd seen the commercials on television and come across ads in the papers, but didn't really believe that something  so light-weight could really solve my problem.  As one who collects photographs and paintings and needs a way to hang them on walls without doing too much damage--which is to say without leaving too many holes in them--I've recognized the need for a better way, but simply couldn't convince myself that that better way had been found.  Take it from me--it's been found.  Pictures do not fall down or rip gaping holes in painted walls.  And if measurements are off and hangers need to come down and be placed more accurately, Command's picture hangers can easily accommodate those efforts too while leaving no tell-tale trace of where the hangers were initially placed.  I love the product and recommend it to any thinking about giving their walls a workout too.\n"

We've used them for so many things, including hanging our backpacks, plastic grocery bags, and purses on the wall rather than on the floor. Even when bags are full, this jumbo hook supports the weight easily. I've hung my backpack with a full water bottle, laptop, and wallet on it and never had an issue. I've never had one leave a mark on my walls or remove paint, but on a door with a very dark wood finish/stain, they did take off a bit off the finish when removed. This didn't surprise me, because the finish was coming off on cleaning rags and stuff when I was dusting and cleaning. But still, use caution with dark wood surfaces.The smaller hooks are great for hanging washcloths, dishcloths and towels (rather than throwing them over the edge of the faucet or sink, or hanging off the oven handle... which is what we did before).Make sure you follow the directions. The surface should be clean and dry. They recommend that you clean it with alcohol first, which can strip off some of the paint or finish, so be careful and gentle when you do that. The first time I did it, I really rubbed with the alcohol, which removed some of the paint from my wall.\n"

          "\n  Have to tell you the truth....I never really put faith in any of these Command products.  How could you trust putting heavy, valuable items on a hook that is not screwed into the wall, but rather supported by adhesive?I needed to create a hook to hang my bathrobe on my closet door.  I really didn't want to resort to drilling and putting a screw in the door.  I took the chance and ordered one of these Jumbo Command Hooks.  It was really cheap and became an add-on item to the rest of my order.Installation was super easy.  You basically prep the area you want to stick the hook to with rubbing alcohol.  The instructions do advise you not to use any other household cleaning products to do that.  Next, you remove the red adhesive on the back of the stickers and place them on the hook.  Then remove the black stickers and place the hook on your desired location.  Of course, there's a few seconds and minutes of pressing into place for all procedures that are involved.  You also need to allow the hook to rest in place for about an hour before hanging anything on it.My bathrobe weights 5lbs.  This hook is rated for 7.5 lbs.  I am now going on day two of having this hook support my robe and it's doing an admirable job.What I really like about this hook is if I no longer need it, it easily removes without any adhesive residue -- at least, that is what the manufacturer is claiming.This product does come with an extra set of adhesives in case you make a mistake and need to start over.Count me in as someone who is very impressed with this product.  It really does seem strong enough to support its advertised weight capacity.  Additionally, I am just really happy I was able to put a hook on my closet door without having to drill.Highly recommended!\n"

I have several of these hooks painted classic bronze to match the ORB hardware in my bathroom. I have a couple that are painted chrome to match the 7\"-blade chrome fan that's hanging on them.The classic bronze-painted hooks are on my bathroom travertine walls. They serve as towel hooks. The adhesive hasn't failed yet (going on 6 years now). What usually fails is the plastic itself - i.e., the \"hook\" part breaks off after a few years. That's probably from people tugging down their towels. The hooks can hold 7.5 lbs but not when people keep tugging down on their towels.I have one hook (actually, the wall back part only, not the outside hook part) holding up a 21\" x 21\" wall frame that's ~5 lbs. The frame has a horizontal length of braided wire at the back that you're supposed to hang on a nail/hook. I didn't want to drill a hole in my travertine tiles so I just used the wall/back part of this 17004 hook to hang the frame.\n"

Humidity doesn't seem to negatively impact the hangers -- I was without AC for about three days when the temp was in the 90s; although my home got super humid/hot, it didn't cause these Command hangers to lose their grip on the wall.  Installation, as with any Command product, was super easy.  It was a little tricky balancing the level across the two hangers because of the shape on top, but other than that, no problems at all.Tip:  Make sure that you follow the directions in order to get the best performance from this type of hanger -- you really do need to let it set on the wall for at least 30 minutes before hanging the canvas on it.  I've learned in the past that if you don't do it that way, the Command hanger doesn't get a solid enough grip and can fall off the wall within a few months.  If you follow the directions, these types of hangers will stay up for years -- and when you do remove them, they don't peel paint.

They do say no-damage, and in my experience that's *mostly* true (they have ripped off a layer of paint here or there, but honestly to me it's worth it for the convenience of using them).  Things they eliminate:1) Pictures that tilt on the wall over time.  We have a picture on the wall next to a door, and when we hung it from a nail we found that closing and opening the door over time always made it tilt to the side.  With these hanging strips, it stays right in place.2) You know when you hang pictures from two nails (one on each side) and you just can't QUITE get both sides even?  Not a problem with this, since it works kind of like velcro you can just get the pieces stuck on \"close enough\" and then adjust a little with no problem.Hanging pictures with these things is a breeze, and if you live in an apartment / dorm where you can't put holes in the wall, they are definitely worth it.  No more of that stupid tacky putty stuff that leaves oil marks on the walls and falls off half the time - you got to get these strips.\n"

Pretty strong stuff.  I had to add another one a few minutes ago to my rack that I made for my very heavy mod box battery boxes that have two 18650 cells each (3 battery boxes x 2 batteries each) plus 3 other smaller batteries on the rack was just too much weight for two of the \"velcro\" fasteners.  Adhesive wasn't a problem just the \"velcro\" started separating from the weight.  A third strip along the top of the rack has done the trick.  Quite a heavy load but is working quite well so far.

I've had them for a few months now, and although I place heavy items in some of them, they have stayed on the cabinet doors with no issues.  My cabinets are cheap cabinets with the \"laminated\" coating on the front and back.  I cleaned the area where I was installing the caddy with rubbing alcohol and let it dry.  I did a \"dry run\" to make certain the caddy wouldn't hit the shelves and used a level to ensure the caddy would be straight and even. I marked the location with a pencil, then placed the strips on the caddy and stuck the caddy on the cabinet door.  I resisted the urge to fill them immediately; I actually let them stay in place overnight before filling them.  These were a great problem-solver for me.  Spice packets are easy to see and don't fall over in the cabinets.  My \"coffee cabinet\" is easier to use because the filters and stir-sticks are easy to reach but out of the way.

I would recommend measuring your cabinets carefully (not just the doors, but the inside frame of the cabinets and the location of the shelves to make sure it will fit).  I would order the largest size that would fit one's cabinets because they're sturdy and hold very well if the surface is prepared beforehand.\n"

I live in Texas where weather fluctuates and changes at the drop of the hat, and this hook has held strong in 100 degree heat as well as frosty 20s.I was worried about a traditional wreath hanger damaging the weather strip so this was a good solution. It's also a great option if you have a tall front door like mine and want to hang your wreath at eye level, which isn't possible with most over the door hangers as they're not long enough (or are long enough but have a huge metal/plastic stick visible).\n"

I hang different sized holiday wreaths year round on my wooden front door. I do a quick wipe to make sure the area I'm about to hang the hook on my door isn't dusty and follow the directions to wait a certain amount of time before hanging anything from it. Works like a charm! The wreaths I hang vary from smaller - less than a pound to approx. 3-4lb wreaths and these adhesives last for months at a time before I have to replace. The hook itself I received in this order was bronze in color, but plastic in feel and appearance. Just as an FYI because the previous hook I purchased in store cost more but was actual metal. They both have the same promise of being able to hold \"up to 5lb\" on the packaging so it didn't make a difference to me. I love Command products for no damage hanging!\n"

Do this again for the opposite bottom corner. (Just like in the picture.)2.) Firmly press both strips against the foam by pinching your thumb and fingers together for 10 seconds. You will not damage or alter the foam in any way by doing this.3.) Peel the other side of the command strips. Place it on the wall in your desired spot and press HARD against the wall for at least 10 seconds. Make sure you're applying that pressure right on top of the command strips. Again, this won't hurt the foam or your wall.Works great! I've had zero issues with the soundproofing falling or not sticking properly.

I didn't want to give the landlord any ammo for chiseling away our deposit, so when it came to hanging pictures and our holiday stockings, I insisted that we buy more hooks from the Command line. These are terrific, and perform exactly as expected.Be careful when you buy them: the engineers at 3M have done a good job of designing them to hold specific amounts of weight, and mark them accordingly. If you are hanging a heavy 5-lb. picture mirror, for example, then you need to ensure that you read the fine print and not just buy the first item that shows up after you type \"3M Command\" as a search string. I've even weighed items using our kitchen scale to make sure I matched our to-be-hung items to the appropriate hook.As promised, they remove easily from household painted surfaces in our kitchen, bathroom, and living spaces.

A couple of suggestions for anyone new to these, so you can benefit from my trial and error:1. Make sure the surface you're applying to is clean, especially kitchen walls which may have unseen residue typical from regular cooking. Otherwise, you may experience issues with adhesion over time.2. Choose a less humid day to hang these. If that's not an option, wipe your surface area thoroughly with a damp cloth, then run a fan on it for a bit until thoroughly dry. Keep fan running during application if possible.3. Use more than you think you'll need based on the packaging suggestion. I typically use two pairs of strips (top and bottom) for anything 8 x 10 or larger, or for anything with any weight to it. An extra strip may be more than you need, but trust me, you don't want to end up with less than you need when your cherished portrait comes crashing to the floor. In my many, many uses of these strips, I have fortunately only had this happen once. These strips are quite sturdy.4. It can be easier to hang items if you first press the strips together, then apply the sticky sides to the item you are hanging, and then finally to the surface on which you're hanging the item. A small level set on top of your picture/item will ensure a nice even look.4. When removing, pull the tab while applying mild pressure to the strip, holding it against the application surface. This will lessen the likelihood of a chunk of paint from being pulled off.Overall, this is a great, very useful product which will allow you to hang and change up your favorite decor without damaging your walls. Highly recommended.\n"

I followed directions for the latter, waited as instructed, and surprisingly none have ever fallen where you would expect\u2014in the shower\u2014when it's dry and esp when it's in use, and w/plenty of steam from hot water where the water doesn't actually hit.Some hooks on the side and the shower's other end are held on w/standard strips\u2014not water-resistant strips\u2014and nothing has ever budged, much less fallen.

I've made every mistake before getting the hang of using them. The first time I pulled a command strip, I ripped paint off the wall by not pulling them straight down to almost a foot long. I've put them on walls that have been painted a week before and when taking them down, removed that layer of paint (the say wait 7 days, but you really need to wait a month to get well established paint). But since them I've used the command strips successfully time and time again. I've even also reused the velcro part with regular command strips without a problem.\n"

          "\n  I'm a big fan of 3M's Command products and use their Picture Hangers in areas where nails or drilling holes isn't recommended. They were ideal for mounting the 3 long under-cabinet lights above the kitchen counter, and the most-recent use was installing small shelves for the gnomes to sit on above the living room curtains. Adhesive pads were provided to hang the latter but one look at the damaged wall when a user tried to remove the shelf hung w/them was all it took to find another method.As for pictures themselves, though, they aren't ideal unless you're very precise w/your measurements. Once you press the picture frame or whatever you're hanging against them and the strips lock into place there's no straightening or adjusting it 'just a tad' w/o a lot of bother.Note, though, that the strips do tend to dry out over time and for that reason removing them isn't always as easy as 3M would have you believe. So if you find it necessary to remove any of them pull down VERY SLOWLY and you should have no problem.\n"

May not adhere to well to vinyl surfaces.DO NOT use for antiques, heirlooms, or other valuable or irreplaceable items.DO NOT hang items over beds.That really says it all, doesn't it? Don't hang anything of value and don't hang it in a place that will hurt if it falls on your head.These are easy to install and work great for collage-type projects, as you have the ability to place photos in an exact location. We have used them for things like smoke detectors, canvas art and smaller pictures. So far, they have worked well. It is very important that you follow the installation instructions. Be patient; make sure you wait the allotted 30 minutes before hanging your items. I usually wait longer, just to be on the safe side. The hanging strips come off cleanly and easily.Keep in mind when you are ordering these, the recommended usage for picture sizes are as follows:Small Strips:  1 set for a 3x5, 2 sets for a 5 x 7 and 4 sets for an 8 x 10.Medium Strips: 1 set for an 8 x 10, 2 sets for an 11 x 17 and 4 sets for an 18 x 20.I, personally, have never hung anything with only 1 strip; I've always used at least two.This package has 4 sets of small strips and 8 sets of medium strips.

I had tried another brand of adhesive hook that I had replaced twice because they let go. In doing so, they left a yucky, sticky mess of stuck on adhesive.So I decided to find another alternative and found the Command hooks. In this case, I used the medium hooks because they are supposed to hold 3 pounds and the cover I wanted to hang were just under 3 pounds. I cleaned off the adhesive left by the other hooks, cleaned the area with alcohol as recommended, and left the Command hook on the door for an hour as recommended. So far it has been a couple of weeks and the hooks are holding. I couldn't be happier, and would highly recommend these hooks. I also suggest that any area you use the Command hooks is clean and smooth. This will help them to stick more permanently. I also love that these can be easily removed when you no longer need them.UPDATE 3/30/18:The hook that I originally installed on the back of a cabinet door to hold my silicone casserole covers in April of 2016 is still holding strong two years later.\n"

We first discovered these when I noticed how straight the picture frames were in my sister-in-law's gallery wall. They hung all of the frames with Command picture hanging strips. Our crooked frames were already hung with nails, so we used Command Stabilizer Strips to keep them straight - they work great!Once the stabilizer strips were taken care of, there were some other items to hang on our walls. We used the Picture Hanging Strips to hang wooden letters, a foamcore posterboard, and 11x14 canvases.The canvases are not the kind with a wood frame on the back, but the canvas is wrapped around something thin. They are maybe 3/8\" thick. My son has painted several of these at painting parties. It would probably be best to use two strips with them, in the top two corners, but we just used one in the center near the top. They are fairly lightweight and so far it has been fine.The reason we just used one in the center was because we wanted to hang then on our kids' doors part of the time, but we already had a Command hook there for holiday decorations. I ended up removing the hooks and putting a Picture-hanging strip on the back of the Command hook like it would go on the back of a picture. Then a Picture-hanging strip on the door. Now we can hang our Command hook on the door for lightweight holiday decorations (things like a Christmas stocking or felt jack-o-lantern). Or we can remove the hook and put my son's paintings up. It's great to have the versatility. We did have to trim the picture-hanging strip a bit to fit on the back of the hook, but that of course would depend on the size strip and hook you used. I also wouldn't stress the hook too much so we've only used lightweight decorations.As far as using them the normal way, we have been pleased with them. If you don't get it quite straight, remove the picture and try again. We used a small level on top of our frames before pressing the strips together.We had recently repainted our doors, so we made sure to wait a week before applying the strips.

As soon as I got it, I immediately ripped into this, read the directions & placed the holder above all the paint ripped areas  After I let it on the wall over an hour to adhere, I finally placed my canvas print & it\u2019s been hanging, w/o falling even once! I didn\u2019t know COMMAND brand had specific holders just for canvas prints. This was a picture of a lotus opening in the morning when I was in Hawaii so this picture was so precious to me, getting it printed onto canvas & hanging it in my LR so I see it all day, every day, & no more falling  It was just too heavy for even 2 regular COMMAND hooks to hold it. I use these COMMAND brand hooks etc to hang all my pictures or actually canvas prints, most what I call 5 series canvas pics because it\u2019s a series of 5 canvas boards in varying sizes to progressively get smaller at the ends. These are light & easily can be hung by using 1 COMMAND hook since they\u2019re very light. When u get into bigger pics though, this is what is needed & this brand makes them.

I haven't had an issue with items sliding but if I do I'll wrap a rubber band around the handle.\n"

          "\n  I ordered one of these broom grippers to hold my kitchen broom off the floor (to keep the bristles in better shape) and hung up on the back of the closet door.  Been a couple of months now and it works well, so I ordered two more.  I did clean/dry the surface well before adhering the strip to the closet door and waited 24 hours before hanging the broom up (in the gripper).  I used one to grip my cane upright and keep it from falling on the floor when I am working at my desk.  Worked so well I put another gripper for my cane on my nightstand too.  I have arthritic hands so I had to practice using the gripper effectively (roll the handle in and out rather than jamming it in) to allow me to use it easily (without hand/wrist pain).I tried to use one to hang up my aluminum snow shovel but the diameter of the handle was too big for the gripper unfortunately.  Shovel might have been too heavy too?  Specs say: will hold up to 4 lbs and 0.8-1.0\" handles.  Not sure what a 0.8-1.0\" handle is.  My cane measures 3.5\" around and weighs a little more than 1 lb.  The kitchen broom handle measures 2.85\" around (OD?) and weighs about a pound too.\n"

          "\n  I got these because I was not a fan of the white EZ-pass in the window that sticks out like a sore thumb. It is very comparable to the ones that came with the pass but is definitely wider. It has a few pounds of retention so no worry of it falling off when you don't want it to but unlike some of the other methods of \"blacking out\" the EZ-Pass this adds no additional girth and can easily be removed if i wanted to use it in another car for a night. This and some black electrical tape around the EZ-Pass and you would never notice it unless you were really hunting for it. Let me know if this helped anyone.Update: 03/16/16 I am not sure if it was the strips or them being attached to electrical tape but on a pretty warm morning I came out to my truck and it appeared the adhesive attaching the strip to the EZpass had failed and would not stay attached overnight. This time around I removed the tape and gave the EZ-Pass two light coats with some black high temp spray paint. (some I already happen to have on hand) You can still read all the textured writing on the back and I placed a small sticker over my ID numbers so I could remove later and still see them as they are flat and would be hidden by paint. Everything feels rock solid and I will update again if there are any problems. Also the strap that was originally attached to the glass has never come off and is still holding incredibly strong.\n"

          "\n  I've always been a fan of all the Command products and am a loyal user of all of them, but, I have to admit these are my favorites for anything that I want to anchor, either vertically on the wall or horizontally on a surface.  My biggest use so far has been in the RV.  We own a 5th wheel and I use these for mounting clocks and weather gauges on the wall along with lamps, computer printers, alarm clocks and coffee makers on the counters and table tops.  Nothing moves and yet a good pull and the item comes off easily for changing batteries or cleaning.  Compared to the relatively short life span of Velcro (they always seem to lose their \"grip\" over time) these last forever.  They use little \"mushrooms\" that interlock.  The mushrooms are plastic on both sides (no fabric to mat or fray) and I've never had a set get damaged or lose their ability to mesh and hold.Any time I've got something that needs to behave like it is nailed down, but, is removable when necessary, I go to these little gems.  As good as all the Command products are, I find myself using these the most, in the RV and around the house.  Even in my computer area; you know those USB hubs that seem to always be in the way but necessary?  I've got two of them stuck to the back wall of the computer desk I use.  They won't fall down, the won't tug down when I plug and unplug USB devices and being on the back wall, they are out of the way.  If one fails, I can pull it down and put up another and if necessary I can use that wonderful Command feature of pulling the strip on the strip and it removes cleanly.\n"

One thing I hope for the future is that it doesn't rust, I have not had it long enough to so if it does or not, especially since I have it in the shower which is a very wet area of the bathroom.

The white clips also don't accommodate large-diameter wires. Overall, those older style clips proved lacking. These 3M Command clips do not suffer from these shortcomings. Prior experience with 3M Command adhesive suggests that these clips will be there until they're no longer wanted. Pull the tab and the clips will come away cleanly. The supplied clear plastic clips are not nearly as visible as the older white ones and they accept larger-diameter cords. Time will tell if they're sturdier. However, these clips are for lead dress or cable management, for keeping wires in their place. You should not get these clips if you intend to put much of a load on them.

Then, just put up some new strips wherever you'd like to move the picture to.I'm amazed at how strong the adhesive is, I was able to hang some decently heavy paintings and after doing a bit of tugging, I'm confident they are secure (I'm not good at estimating weight, but the strips I bought were for pictures up to 16lbs).These are perfect for people who are renting (or just don't want holes in there walls); as well as, those who are not very handy with a hammer and nails (like myself).These strips allow anyone to hang a picture quickly & easily. Now I can cover my walls in art & photos ... not holes!\n"

A word of advice: Make sure you use them correctly or they WILL rip the paint off your wall. If you put one horizontally in a corner or up against something that cannot be moved, make sure you put the tab AWAY from the corner (or whatever) so you have enough room to pull the tab when removing. It's super stretchy and you might need to pull it 2-3 times the length of the strip. I find myself pulling the tab then grabbing and pulling farther up the sticky part as I'm removing to be sure no paint is removed. I've also sewn these into tapestries and other fabrics to hang and it works beautifully!\n"

One reviewer had trouble getting it to stick to tile. My shower is very typical glazed ceramic tile and it stuck very securely . Another person asked about drain holes. The cup is made of a fairly soft plastic, probably to prevent breaking if dropped. I easily drilled 1/8 inch holes from the bottom, then lightly counter sunk them from the inside to improve drainage. The holder leans slightly out from the wall so the water moves toward the front edge of the cup. I am very happy with the product, I only wish they would have included an extra set of Command strips.\n"

My bedroom is very small and there is only room for one tall dresser and no nightstand so I have been purchasing 3m command products to try to allow myself some storage where a nightstand would normally be. I actually took the cup it comes with out and I use the metal frame to hold standard sized water bottle and canned beverages. So far it has not fallen and does not appear to be getting loose due to the weight. I will be sure to update this if it falls. but I think it might work out. Basically if it can hold up a bottle of water it shouldn't have a problem holding make up brushes or a tube of toothpaste and a few toothbrushes.UPDATE: I\u2019ve been using this daily for roughly 6 months now and it\u2019s still holding strong.

I\u2019ve owned a shower mirror held up with the Command strips for over two years and not had any problems. Some of the other shower shelves are held up with suction cups and I\u2019ve had bad luck with those in the past. (My old shower mirror was held up with suction cups and every few months it would detach from the wall and leap to the floor.) Others are attached with adhesives and I wasn\u2019t sure what residue they would leave when removed; the Command strips remove cleanly.Secondly the shelf is made of stainless steel and not prone to rust; and the wire design means water won\u2019t pool on the shelf. I do wish more thought had gone into its design though. The open front allows shorter things to fall out and the spacing of the wires on the bottom is wide enough to allow a razor to fall through if it\u2019s not placed at an angle across a couple of wires.When hanging the shelf the instructions say not to use household cleaners to clean the surface. Ignore that. First clean the surface VERY WELL with whatever it takes to remove all dirt, soap scum, and hard water scale, then RINSE WELL to completely remove all residue, dry, and finally clean with the included alcohol pad. Once the alcohol has completely evaporated install the shelf. You should also clean the back of the mounting base with alcohol and allow it to evaporate prior to applying the Command strips. Then follow the rest of the manufacturer\u2019s instructionsOctober 2020 update:Still firmly attached to my fiberglass shower enclosure.\n"

The porch overhang does not cast a shadow on this hook, so exposure is near naked. Additionally, up here in Montana the annual temperature range can be from minus 20 to over 90 in summer. Yet still, Command hangs in there.I almost always have some sort of decoration hanging from this hook. Nothing heavier than 3 pounds, but the point is, it's getting good usage.The hook is showing no signs of weakening, and I so happy with Command Brand as it lets me be creative without punching or drilling holes all over my house.If there's any significant change is this outdoor hook lasting though winter, I'll write an update. But my experience tells me this hook is up until I pull the strip for removal. :-)\n"

So I figure why not trying to find something for the kitchen as well?The hooks are super easy to use: you just detach a strip, peel off one side, attach it to the plastic hook, then peel off the other side and attach it to whatever super face you want, after having cleaned it well with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Done!And the best thing is that there is a little tab that is not sticky and that can be used when you want to remove them, making the job so much easier than the nail-scraping that is often required to remove adhesive!I've not had the hooks for long so I can't vouch for their durability, but so far so good.

I've even used them to hang backpacks behind a door (great if you don't have a lot of storage) and it works well for that too.***Make sure you don't hang more weight than these hooks are rated to hold! These hooks say on the package they can hold 2 pounds. The small green empty backpack (on the top) in my 2nd pic weighs 1.5 lbs. About a month ago, my husband put a 2nd heavier bag (probably 3-4 lbs) on the hook along with the green backpack, and after a few hours the hook came crashing off. However, that was user error, because these hooks are not rated to hold that much weight! After I realized what he did, I just put the hook back on (I even used the original adhesive strip) and the hook has been fine ever since. People who are having issues with the hook falling off are very likely hanging more weight than it is rated for. 2 pounds is not a lot - if in doubt, measure what you are planning to hang or buy a command hook rated to hold more weight.If you have any questions, let me know, I'm glad to help!

They will, with enough time and pulling or weight, just pull the paint layers with them as they fall off.

I spaced them a foot apart for no more than aesthetics because the clips can certainly bear more weight than I placed on them. The rail overhang was perfect for tucking them up under it and out of the direct sunlight.I paid attention to other reviews stating the white adhesive trips to hold them in place were highly unsightly since the clips are clear, and by the photos, I agree. So my plan was to be prepared when the clips arrived and have a clear adhesive conducive to adhering to wood, which I did.A small smear on both the wood railing and the back of the clip was all that was needed. After allowing the adhesive to set and dry, the lights were easily snapped into place and give the perfect ambience at night.While the adhesive may be fine indoors, using them outside for this purpose truly requires a different type of sticking factor.\n"

The fairies, big and small come with loops on the back so they can hang on any wall. Some of our customers live in rental homes, so we needed to find something that wouldn't damage walls. We used the white ones at first, but when these clear ones came along, that was even better. I was surprised to see some negative reviews out there, so I too conducted a test. I cleaned the wall with isopropyl alcohol and let it dry before hanging the hook. After a 2 hour wait I hung up the fairy - she weighs 5oz - and she's been there ever since; about a month. The wall has minimal texture and I did press the hook very firmly against the wall. Perhaps those having trouble with these hooks have walls that are more textured. Now we can enter this year's craft shows confident that these clear ones are just as good as the white ones - and you can't beat Amazon's price when you purchase the 72 pack!\n"

We live in a mobile home & it can be difficult to hang items with nails/screws, and even then the nail holes etc are always visible if you remove them. I wanted a small, simple shelf for my 6 year old son\u2019s room to display some special keepsakes, photos, etc. Assembly took me less than 5 minutes but I\u2019m very familiar with Command brand items. The most time spent waiting for use is to allow the adhesive to bond to the wall before adding weight to it. I always give it 24 hours. This particular shelf is meant to hold 5 pounds, but that\u2019s plenty for my intended use (I plan to switch up which pictures are displayed etc). Read the description carefully to see if the weight limit and size-including depth- fit your needs. This was the perfect solution for what I wanted. The package contains enough adhesive strips to hang this twice- meaning I used 5 strips to hang it here, now. If I want to move it in the future, I\u2019ve got 5 strips left from the kit to allow me to remove the shelf, and hang it elsewhere with the 5 other strips that came with it. You can also buy size medium Command strips on their own. I\u2019m so happy. I plan to order another, as well as the other configurations available such as the set of 2 smaller shelves.\n"

They work better than I expected, each set is advertised to hold 4 lbs and they do the job.  Using these I have hung paintings, pictures, a very small mirror, a key ring/rack, and even a coat rack.  I did not clean with alcohol or anything like they recommended, and I've had no problems so far.  For hanging the coat rack I used 5 sets of these strips to be extra safe and it is surprisingly sturdy, even as it gets tugged and pulled from coats and backpacks every day it doesn't budge.  In fact, the grip is so strong I can't separate the velcro to detach the coat rack from the wall, so I'm not sure how I'll pull the adhesive's tabs to remove these at the end of the lease, but we'll light that firecracker when we get to it.  Word of warning however to anyone who may find themselves in a similarly odd situation, the building I am in is quite old and has been painted an absurd amount of times, and for one heavier picture frame (a vinyl record display), the adhesive of these strips held strong but the many layers of paint it was stuck to actually peeled off the wall and down went the frame.  The command strip never let go of the paint, but it was too much weight for the paint to handle and the paint left the wall.  Who would have known that could be a problem.  If you're in an old building as well, keep in mind to add more strips to spread out the weight so this doesn't happen to you.  Overall, I highly recommend these for anyone doing damage free hanging, these are quite effective.\n"

I searched Amazon for products that can help hang the portraits without nails. That\u2019s when I came across these hanging strips and thought of giving it a shot. I was able to place portrait of last supper in the dining room using these strips and they are very sturdy. Per my experience, two strips should be able to hold 3 - 4 lbs. If you want to hold more than that, I would suggest going for 4 strips. It\u2019s very easy to use with one part getting onto the wall and other part on the frame, just place strips against other and apply pressure to ensure frame is secure to the wall. It\u2019s also easy to remove with just lifting the picture off the wall, just that we need to pull up at an angle, not straight out. I have tried this strip on the wall that has normal paint, so not sure of its performance on glossy paper or wall papers. Per product details, approved surfaces are pained wall board, painted or vanished wood, glass, metal and tile. It specifically mentions not to use on wall paper. During usage, I did not use any cleaning materials and the strips has worked fine for me. I\u2019ve had no problems till now.

          "\n  I have a few cables (video, Ethernet, etc.) draped around my house and used these cord clips to help hold them up. In the past, I used the white ones, but I was excited to see a clear version so it would look neater on my non-white walls. Here are some things I think are most important: * SIZE: These can comfortably hold a Cat 5e Ethernet cable (the reason I originally got them), plus maybe another very small cable if you need to (3.5mm audio? never tried). It can also hold one Monoprice Cat 6 Ethernet cable but with no room to spare. I couldn't quite fit in my coax/RG6 cable in, but that will depend on the wire gauge. A thick DVI cable was also too big for these, but it does fit in the medium size.* STICKINESS: The white strips do stick more strongly than the clear ones. I've only noticed this when trying to run cables around corners, which I've solved by loosening up my turn radius a bit--something I probably should be doing for the sake of the cable, anyway. I don't think this will really matter for cord clips because I can't imagine someone using them for anything heavy enough to matter in the first place. In either case, you'll probably also want to follow their preparation instructions, including cleaning the area with alcohol first and allowing it to try, as well as having some \"rest\" time after installation before use to allow the adhesive to work better.* REMOVAL: I've changed my mind about where I want my cables and how I want them organized a few times. I've always had the clear strips remove without damage as long as I follow the instructions. Crucially, you need to pull the non-adhesived tab on the strip straight down--very far down. As it stretches, the adhesive holding the strip to both the hook and the wall will loosen (so hold the hook with your other hand to avoid projectile hook injuries). You *cannot* just pull the strip off the wall normally. That's the only time when I've damaged my paint, and it's only when I accidentally pulled the hook and strip off the wall during a cable-routing accident, and that was long enough ago that I can't even remember if it was a white or clear strip (I suspect the white ones are more likely to cause damage in this situation).* PRICE: These are hard for me to find locally, but on similar Command products, Amazon always seems to have the best price. Amazon also has a good price on the clear refill strips, which I can't even find locally. The hooks themselves are reusable. The pack comes with a couple extra strips, but since I've done a lot of rearranging, I've had to buy more.* OTHER: With both these and the white hooks, I've had the tab that the \"arm\" of the hook is supposed to latch into break off. This prevents the hook from working as intended, but with larger cables the \"arm\" still holds the cable in enough that I can barely even notice. I've had this happen on a few hooks (total--I've gone through several packs of these) and can probably blame at least a couple of those on me pulling too hard trying to put too much in the hook.In general, I think these clips work well and are priced reasonably. I'd recommend them to anyone who wants to organize cords or cables without doing anything permanent or wall-damaging. Just be sure to follow the removal instructions if the non-damaging part of this product is important to you (it is to me--it's why I bought them).\n"

First, make sure you wait until any new paint is completely \"dry.\"  Latex paints take a full month to completely cure.  Then, use the proscribed cleaner (I use denatured alcohol) before applying the strip to the wall.  Then, wait at least the suggested one hour before hanging the picture.  I usually wait until the next day.  If the picture is heavy, use more than one hanging strip.  Most of my paintings in wood frames require two strips.  Using two strips with a wire hanging painting helps to keep the painting level anyway.  I have some large paintings in heavy frames that I have used four strips to hang.  For the large, heavy paintings you have to figure out a semi-circular pattern for the strips on the wall so that each strip carries a portion of the weight - if you just put them in a straight line, only the two outer strips carry the weight.  So far, after two years, even these heavy paintings are securely attached to the wall.  I've used more than 200 of the command strips - my wife has quite a collection of artwork - and so far, all the strips have worked reliably.Best source is drugstore dt com - beats the price of any on-line or retail location by about 20%.Enjoy!\n"

You snap the two sides together, apply to your frame, take 30 seconds of pressure to get the wall piece to adhere and then, if you wish, you can snap off, snap on, swap out, reorganize your layout to your heart's content. Depending on the weight of your frame (mine all weighed much less than the max. recommended per strip), I've found there's even a little play in how specifically you line up the connection. Need to move a frame about half an inch or so in any direction? Just pull it off and line up less of the little teeth. I'm sure that doesn't make sense, but buy a set and experiment for yourself. I also love that there's no annoying -daily- straightening of frames required when you use these. Your picture will stay securely locked at the angle you chose to hang it. And no nail holes!!!!

I have a big household, a family of five with two dogs, our daily water need is quite high. The water flow with filter 1 is time-consuming to fill a cup of water, especially when everybody gets home around the same time and all want some ice water. Therefore, I recommend any household over four to purchase a water filter system rather than rely on the filtered water through the refrigerator. We recently switched to an under sink Waterdrop reverse osmosis water filtration system. Though it is pricy to purchase in the first place, the system definitely satisfied our water need and the replacement filters are also affordable considering the filter life and replace frequency. The system is also quite stylish and only takes very little space. I use the filtered water to make coffee and fresh OJs for my family in the morning and they all love it. I think the major reason is that the system reduces a great percentage of TDS in the original water, which the water after filtration is not that \u201chard.\u201dI used to find those ugly white scale deposits pile up on my kettle, but I do not have to deal with it anymore with the help of this RO system.\n"

I had a hard time figuring out whether this filter met the standards, as the information I could find only said it was NSF certified and did not list the specific standards or claims under each standard.  This meets NSF/ANSI 42 for taste (\"aesthetic effects\"), 53 for \"health effects,\" and 401 for \"emerging contaminants.\"  I'm attaching a picture of the NSF certification on the package that I received, but you can (and should) verify the certification and standards claimed by Whirlpool by searching for the filter under Whirlpool's old model number NL240V on the NSF website.  I was concerned about Atrazine (a pesticide that I found in my water) and lead.FILTER COMPATIBILITYSeveral reviews mention that this filter does not replace part #4396508.  My Whirlpool manual listed my replacement part as #4396508, and this fits.  I entered my model number on the Whirlpool website to verify compatibility.  The top of my filter looked exactly like the old one (which was a #4396508 left by the previous owner).  I don't know whether there are counterfeits or bad batches floating around, but I bought mine directly from Amazon and not from a third party seller.OTHER NOTES*Replacing the filter has really improved my water flow.*You have to flush four gallons--a lot--through the filter before you use it the first time.*Replace every 6 months.\n"

One of the magnets fell out of the bottom, but I can easily sew it back in (non-sewers could probably use super glue).It has taken so much abuse, between the hot midwest sun to the sub-freezing temps and three German Shepherds racing through it multiple times a day. I still highly recommend this for anyone wanting to keep bugs out of their house. It's such a practical alternative to a sliding screen door.

I just used the tacks & stuck them in a few key places. I started by holding it up to get it aligned & placed the top center tack. It\u2019s a little tough getting the tacks through the edge because it\u2019s reinforced really well, so if you\u2019re doing this method. It\u2019s probably easiest to push the tacks through first. I did the top sides next, then worked down the side to the bottom making sure the center could still close. I got a couple in the bottom sides & it was solid. I was able to push the tacks in a bit, but used a hammer to finish the job. They\u2019re pretty sturdy tacks.We\u2019ve got 3 German Shepherds and they were able to get in & our pretty easily & the screen closed pretty nicely behind them. I walked in & out several times carrying things and it didn\u2019t get tugged too much & sealed after I\u2019d walked through. We may even try replacing our sliding screen with this so we can open & close it.This was exactly what I wanted, it\u2019s working wonderfully so far and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it!\n"

Only took a day for all 4 dogs (2 of which are only 6 mths and 2 that are 5 yrs) to figure out how to push in and out of this screen. It's easy for them to push through, yet strong enough to stay closed, and close up right after they go through it. My husband was even more skeptical than I was (mumbled something about \"wasting money\" when he first saw it) and he even admitted that this was a really great purchase that exceeded expectations. The only thing I can maybe say in the negative is the bottom tacks on each side kept coming out from the dogs pushing in and out all the time so I just put 2 longer wide head nails in those bottom corners to hold better. Not really a design flaw, I just have 2 not so gentle 60 pound pups.\n"

There\u2019s a sensor that picks up any sounds/music and the lights will follow the beat of the sound/music. They are super easy to set up. Like literally all you do is plug in the wires and remove the tape from the lights and stick them to the wall! However, it\u2019s a 2 person job (for me at least). The lights are really bright and they look really cool in the room. Honestly, you\u2019ll feel like your in a club! :)\n"

They stick really well and she has had no problem using the remotes or getting the lights to sync with her music. My only negative comments are that 1. I wish you could attach more strips without having to plug in additional power cords and remotes and 2. it would be nice if the cords were longer so you don't have the power box hanging down your wall, attached to an extension cord. The lights in the picture are not actually that bright, lol. It's just the camera. The lights are actually quite pleasantly colored.\n"

For reference,  the picture above shows this brand (the red) and another brand (the white).  As you can see, the lights are more evenly spaced on this one.  My son has them up there kind of at random,  but if you were looking for precise results,  then this is important.  Although the remote is handy at times, I think it is best to buy ones that can be controlled through an app.  If you have more than one strip in a room, the remote can change those as well by accident.  With the app, you have more control over the exact color and pattern changes.  I also like that it can be set up to react to music or sound.

I didn't realize it and doesn't 10-15 minutes looking for directions in the description (which wasn't there lol) because it doesn't come with the instructions...Anyway it's very sticky which is good... Sooo simple to put on... Unravel it first, before taking off the red backing map out your route then start sticking to you wall... It is shockingly so cool lol.. I didn't know if I would be ok with the whole club vibe but I figured let me stop low key hating because we didn't have this as kids ha! I played with all the settings myself until me teen kicked me out \ud83e\udd23 It really went around his whole room and around and under the window... If your child's room is the size of the \"Head of the house room\" than maybe get two boxes... We bought the box that has 3 rolls inside and that was perfect. It really gets bright but you can adjust it and make it dimmer... The blue is so subtle and not as harsh on the eyes in my opinion... But then again I don't like bright lights and I can't do led lights because I'm a migraine sufferer.. But as my son said \"Um, I love you but it's not your room... so you can go now\" ...

          "\n  The tenmiro led strip for sure is worth the money. It is important to note that the density of these leds is roughly 15 leds/m, less than the average 30. Therefore in my personal opinion, these are better suited as underglow rather than directly visible. In this regard, they are absolutely perfect. I have them set up as underglow for my bed and LOVE them. I could also see these working great as underglow for a desk or dresser. My favorite effect is the rainbow effect which looks phenomenal under my bed.The ability to control the strip in 3 different ways has to be my favorite part. All three methods, the controller, the remote, and the app, worked flawlessly for me. The app has the most options of the three, giving names for all the different modes and more precise control over things like color and speed. However, just about anything can be done with the remote and even the three button in-line controller as well, which is just spectacular.Another huge feature of this strip is the fact that it is powered via usb. No need for and huge power adapters or anything fancy. I plugged them in to a samsung brick and it worked great for me. This makes the whole setup much more reparable in the case something breaks. Absolutely love that.\n"

When selecting a color or pattern, the same color and pattern goes across all 4 strips.  These LEDs are NOT individually addressable.  If you want to have that functionality, like light chasing patterns, or each LED to be of a different color than its neighbors, then you need to look at a different style of LED Strip (look for DREAMCOLOR or \u201cChasing LED\u2019s\u201d in the descriptions).The lights are NOT WEATHER PROOF or WATERPROOF.  These lights were designed to be in an indoor configuration as the diodes for the LED are simply surface mounted and exposed to the environment with no protection on a carrier strip.  So behind a TV, under inside cabinets and molding, and accent lights for a room or under a bed would be a great place to put these.The adhesive on the strip looks to be \u201cjust barely strong enough\u201d to hold it in place. So if you intend to have it mounted for a longer time, I would suggest looking into adding or replacing the adhesive that comes with the strips or using some mounting hardware or dedicated LED strip mounting channels. If you want to beef up the adhesive, 3M makes great adhesive tapes for this need.The strip itself is basically a flexible circuit board where the diodes and other surface mount components are affixed.  The LEDs are 50x50mm and each LED carrier contains separate diodes for Red, Green, or Blue in the physical package.  While this configuration does give great color for the 3 primary colors, giving combinations of colors (like an orange, or a yellow, or a white) is not as pure as what you might be expecting, but all in all still pretty good. The strips have cut areas about every 6.5\u201d so you can trim the length of the strip to match most desired lengths.  Each section has 3 LED packages on it, giving an equivalent of 3 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Blue LED\u2019s per strip.  There is no additional \u201cwhite\u201d LED (cold or warm) on this strip.If you do choose to cut and splice, make sure you get the 4 conductor connectors for LED strips. It is possible to buy extra connecting hardware to splice back in cut lengths together \u2014 however, I would suggest keeping the total length of one powered run as what was provided by the factory \u2014 unless you can engineer in more +12V power supplies.  From what I have seen as \u201cstandard issue\u201d, a 12V 1.25A supply should power 1 leg of 5M (16.5\u2019) of LEDs.The Remote is Infra-Red \u2014 you have to point the remote at the IR LED that comes off the controller.  If you don\u2019t have a clear line of sight between the remote and the controller, you won\u2019t be able to control the lights.  If you want to have it so that you can control it via Radio signals, look for a replacement controller that does support RF operations.This controller is NOT MUSIC / SOUND sensitive.The Power supply is sufficient to power the four included rolls of LED Strip lighting with no apparent issues. The power supply cord from the wall to the power brick is a little on the short side ( about 18\u201d ) and the length from the power brick to the barrel connector was about 3 feet \u2014 and is as usually expected for a generally sourced 12v 5A power adapter. It is 2 pronged which is typical for the US power grid, and this version did not have interchangeable power connectors in case you wanted to install these in UK, FR, etc.So, again, these strips function as specified, so no issues there.  Just make sure that these give you the ability to get you the quality of light you need and only use these indoors in an average humidity environment.\n"

These Febreze Kenmore C Replacement Vacuum Bag do the trick every time.  They are great and trapping and keeping the stinky dog hair and carpet fibers in while releasing a fresh (not \"perfumy\", but actually fresh) scent into the air.

Also, the hose should be a bit longer--so as not to strain it. My hose did last several years: From now on, nevertheless, I'll let the hose hang loose--courtesy of the expert advice here.Amazon's Logistics:Shipment was lightning fast--Amazon has decided to obtain a fleet of handsome vans for deiveries--in response to the gutting of the USPS. (This reminds me of Rockefeller's using pipelines--in order to foil Vanderbilt and his trains.)Preparation--you may need it:Before delivery, I did remove both hose-end fittings from the torn hose. Detaching the interior fitting allows for invoking the cheaper model hose--that with the simpler, yet incompatible, internal fitting--to facilitate later replacements. (Undoing the fittings proves somewhat tedious and difficult--you may simply drill or Dremel those carefully free, if necesssary, though.)Frustration returns for DIY:I wasn't totally certain that the interior fitting of this new hose would fit--some idiot ambiguity does exist. It seems that my machine's model doesn't exist, either! Frankly, Amazon's search engine, too often, is practically worthless for parts like this: Multitudes of idiot irrelevancies pop up--new machines, incompatible parts, competitor\"s parts, untelated accessories. You may need a valid part number, or something close--in order to \"glean\" the correct part from those vended....Scrapping and scavenging:I accidentally broke the connector for the brush-end fitting conector on the broken hose: I took that apart. You get an extra tubing clamp and some screws. Pull out the 1/4\" tubing--it's the same type as the interior tubing. Then, you end up with the main hose--that may prove useful later. If not, stripping out that tough wire inside will prove useful--that's something that's hard to find--and pricey then. (That sort of thing inevitably proves useful--later on....)\n"

Once removed, place the posts on this piece into the designated slots in the vacuum bottom, then lift it up so that the bigger, pointy bit on the part tucks under the rotating brushes.

Yes, it does not come with instructions, but there ARE instructions in the Model 1986 manual.  That said, figuring out how to attach it was not intuitive.  Simple once you learn how!2.  It did a pretty good job picking up water; my LVP (textured wood) floor dried about as fast as it does when being mopped with a Libman Wondermop.  Likewise, my tiled bathroom floor dried reasonably quickly, though there clearly was more water left in the grout lines than on the tiles.  But I would definitely NOT complain like I have seen others do!3.  YOU MUST USE THE \"EXPRESS CLEAN\" SETTING!  Or you will get far too much water!  Perhaps that was the problem for other reviewers who complained?I truly do not know how well it cleaned, as my LVP floor is dark and never looks dirty!  The tile looked pretty good, but it had been pretty clean before I cleaned it.All in all, it seems pretty good, but I am not convinced it saves any labor over my mop!!\n"

I was not even able to turn the brush by hand.  Well, I could have just given up at that point and threw it in the trash or asked for a refund.  Instead, I ended up taking the thing apart.  I noticed the large grey wheel, which generates the suction to spin all the gears, was bound up.  I worked that thing loose by spinning it by hand until it turned freely.  I reassembled my brush, and I tested it with a Shark vacuum (I had finished using my carpet cleaner and put it away before I started messing with this attachment).  The brush spun very fast, and kept spinning when I placed it against my hand.  I think I will save this for the next cleaning project.  It is too bad as I was looking forward to using this on my carpeted stairs.I will update as to whether or not my fix worked.Update:  Whatever was wrong with the brush is apparently fixed.  The brush worked great agitating my medium piled carpet on my stairs, and it did not bog down at all.  This will be handy for the next time the dog tracks mud into into my house.  I also upped my rating from three stars to four stars.\n"

It was easy to replace and comes with large instructions with pictures. It took me ten minutes. It took a couple of minutes to get and keep the small belts on the brushes as I mounted them onto the spindles. Works great.

Let me tell you - that's not how a shop vac works. The good news is that as I screamed and ran, this shop vac WAS very effective at pulling hornets out of the layered sweatshirts I had on. I was absolutely amazed at the suction power of this shop vac when a hornet is repeatedly trying to push its stinger past two layers of thick cotton.That said, I use this shop vac to vacuum my garage and parts of my house and it works wonderfully.

NOISE; about as loud as most canister or shop vacs I have used.  I would not describe as quiet.  My cell app measured noise from 5\" away at 80dB, similar to a noisy street or an alarm clock. HOSE;  Hose diameter is about 1 1/2\" OD.  It is much easier to work than typical shop vac.  The best thing is the ability to reach every corner of 20x30' workshop with ease.  Workshop is heated to 50F in winter.  Hose did not get stiff at that temperature.  A concern was small diameter hose clogging.  Cleaned workshop that was a mess without issue.  SUCTION  Is adequate but not impressive.  About the same as a good small canister vac.  One reviewer said vac was as strong as his car wash's vacs.  This is no where near as strong as my car wash's vacs, but again I find the suction adequate for most jobs.  If your expectations match the machines capabilities, you should be happy.

My suggestion is to invest $4.95 and go to Home Depot and purchase a Suncast \u201cHose Hangout\u201d made for a garden hose. It has additional space to wind up the vacuum hose making it way easier.

Excellent if you\u2019re trying to get rid of odors.\u2014 Has silent mode and automatic night mode.\u2014 The air quality indicator (and its auto fan speed adjustment) is useful and interesting to see the numeric display when the dust kicks up (during vacuuming, cooking, construction).It\u2019s not perfect though, here are some minor things I don\u2019t like:\u2014 It makes an annoying electrical humming sound that is somewhat audible, which defeats the purpose of the quiet mode.\u2014 The air quality sensor doesn\u2019t auto-adjust the speed when it\u2019s on quiet mode (but it does on my RabbitAir).  It would be better if there was a way to make it run on auto mode during the day, and quiet mode when it is dark in the room.\u2014 The air quality sensor is not sensitive enough, even when I kick up some dust in the room it's always hovering around 002 or 003.\u2014 The air intake is located on the side opposite from the air quality display, so you can\u2019t back it up right next to the wall and need to leave a bit of a gap next to the wall so it can breathe.  As a result, the air circulation for gathering dust is less than ideal (vs. a front facing intake).\u2014 The fan has a wobble (not sure if this affects the function or not).Overall, I recommend this air400 if you want to be able to filter a large amount of air with excellent charcoal odor filtering in a relatively compact form factor, and something quiet with night mode.I recommend the RabbitAir if you want something really compact and stylish that is dead silent (it's even quieter than the air400).Here\u2019s a peek inside the grille for an interesting look at the fan blade when it\u2019s powering up and down.\n"

The twist knob is much harder to use and I have a fear if I twist too hard it will break or the whole attachment will fall.2. This new design is much smaller, but much louder to use for plain old faucet water. You can practically wake up the house.3. The way the filter dispenses filter water is no longer stream line.

After the battery dies it cannot be replaced since it's in a sealed compartment. This does not bode well for a company that brags that you will be saving the landfilled approximately 1800 bottles a year, if you use their product. Supposedly you can still use the pitcher after 5 years but the indicator light will no longer work. This also makes me think Britta is probably figuring their pitcher will need to be replaced every five years.The pitcher is able to use the standard filter as well as the blue long last filter. Using the blue long last filters cost a few dollars more, compared to buying enough of the standard filters to last the same amount of time. However they don't need to be changed as often and you'll save the planet from a little extra waste.Overall I think the pitcher is adequate. But I would like to see a more durable pitcher as this one is made out of cheap plastic. Several years ago I had one that dropped and broke into several pieces. They're not exactly durable. It seems like after several years Brita would have came out with a better quality product. But like all things in business they're designed to wear out in order for business to make more money.

In each model I ever had the top level-- pre filtered-- would hold about a quarter as much water as the bottom level, so you'd have to wait for water to filter through the top into the bottom and then refill the top at least 3 times before the bottom was full. I rarely had the patience for that and just wouldn't bother, so I never ended up actually having enough cold filtered water.This filters the water as you pour it out of the pitcher rather than as you fill up the pitcher, so you can fill it to the top very quickly and easily and always have cold water in the fridge ready to go into a bottle or glass.It does still have to filter the water, so you're moving the waiting step to when you pour it into a glass or water bottle. It does take less time than the old style pitcher, and most importantly you aren't stuck over the sink waiting for the process to finish.Even though this costs more than the other type of pitchers it's much more affordable than the type that attaches to the sink. The replacement filters for those are painfully expensive, and personallyI think the water from this style of filter tastes better.This does have a light on the lid to indicate when the filter needs replacing, which I think is a helpful feature.One thing I've found is that when there's not much water left in the pitcher it filters much more slowly, so it's helpful to refill it before it's empty to save the frustration. It also took me a couple minutes tofigure out the instructions for how to place the filter, which turned out to be very, very easy when done correctly, so if you're struggling to remove the filter cover you're most likely doing it wrong.\n"

          "\n  Not long ago, there was only one brand of pitcher-style water filter certified to remove lead. Now there are many, including this one. I used to use that other brand, but was prompted to change because their filters were only lasting a month each, and they were quite expensive - not to mention the rotting fish flavor they added to the water at the end of their life.So, what about this one? First, I love that it's a stand-alone pitcher. If you're a renter or have specialized fixtures already in your kitchen, you'll be glad you don't have to install anything permanent or temporary to use this filter system. You unpack it, install the filter, rinse the filter and you're in business. The convenience is terrific!I ordered the long-last filter, but received the standard filter instead. The merchant has already satisfactorily remedied that problem. But, please note that I'm actually writing about the standard filter. (I'm sure the long-last will be comparable.)The flavor of the water is great. Water in my neck of the woods can vary considerably from one day to the next, so this is a real plus. I went for a few weeks without using a filter and in that short time I started getting a lot of deposits on glasses and my electric kettle. As soon as I put this filter into use, that buildup stopped. So, I know it is removing stuff from my water.I had to ding it one star because if there's any water in the top (unfiltered) reservoir, it is a real mess to pour any water. It dribbles out through the non-existent seal around the top, runs down your hand, across the countertop, onto the floor, etc. So, you have to wait until the top reservoir is empty before pouring yourself a glass of water - or clean up the mess if you don't. It seems this could be easily remedied with a small redesign of the pitcher.I'd recommend this filter system for sure. It removes lead and a lot of other impurities. It makes the water taste great and stops deposits in your glasses and kettles and whatever. It is pretty economical (especially compared to bottled water), easy to use, doesn't require anything to be installed and doesn't add the flavor of rotting fish to your water.\n"

I have been reading the various reviews of this product. This has been my experience:-the filter lasts for about 2 1/2 months (we use it a lot) and then I replace it. It has an indicator that is pressure sensitive. As the pressure increases with usage (the filtration system gets clogged with sediment, etc), a little window mechanically turns from green to half green/red to finally all red which means one should change the filter.-After 2 filter replacements, I replace the bottom unit (the filtration system).-the engineering is not the greatest but it performs satisfactorily. It does develop minor leaks probably due to poor seals.-Also the selector handle gets harder and harder to turn due to the poor seal design and solute deposition but changing the base unit periodically solves that.There are 2 important variables here: water pressure and degree of sediment/particulate/solutes in the local water system. If it had been available, I would have rated this product as 4 1/2 stars\n"

          "\n  The concept is great, a large-capacity Brita filtered water pitcher for the fridge with a handy spigot so the whole thing doesn\u2019t have to be removed for each use. I\u2019ve always seen the convenience in that idea compared to the Brita filtration pitchers I\u2019ve used for years that take up space in my refrigerator door and have to be refilled after each use.Once I got this dispenser home I began to realize that there are pros and cons to its design, some of which may be difficult to overcome.Here\u2019s a brief outline about what I like and what turned out to be not so great about this dispenser:PROS1. The unit seems to be made about the same as most Brita filtration pitchers, which is to say, it is made well. The plastic is a hard polycarbonate that does not alter the taste of the water, is easy to clean and is relatively safe from cracking and shattering.2. Part of the top is hinged and folds back to refill the dispenser (using another container) so the whole thing doesn\u2019t have to be taken to the sink.3. There is a drainage trough molded in to the bottom of the dispenser (one of the reviewers who didn\u2019t like this product is not accurate about not being able to fully empty the container, the drainage trough permits the dispenser to drain almost fully empty. Look at their photo of the product \u2026 it is for an entirely different product that doesn\u2019t even look like the one being sold here, apparently the dispenser has been completely redesigned).4. It uses standard Brita filters which are available almost everywhere.CONS1. The #1 negative is the actual height top-to-bottom of the dispenser is about 10-1/2\u201d. It is impossible for me to arrange my refrigerator to accommodate something that tall. Checking with family and friends most of them said their shelves don\u2019t adjust that far apart either.2. The hole in the spigot is about \u00bc\u201d from the shelf the dispenser is placed on so there is no way to actually use it without pulling the spigot out over the edge of a shelf each time.3. The idea of the hinged refill lid sounds great until you learn that it takes up about eight more inches above the dispenser (even more to allow room for the container you\u2019re pouring from), so in reality you need almost 20\u201d between the shelves in your refrigerator.4. Removing the entire lid (like to replace the filter cartridge) is awkward. The best way to do it is to open the hinged filler lid to grab the lid for removal. That puts a lot of strain on the hinge.5. There are no real carry handles on the dispenser, which can get heavy when filled with water. There are only two very small plastic handles at either end which are difficult to grab and make the dispenser difficult to carry.I still like Brita pitchers and I actually still like this large dispenser, but with the caution that you will need a space to put it that is almost 20\u201d tall and that you can hang the spigot over the edge of the shelf without it getting in the way (if I were to hang it over the edge of the shelf in my refrigerator it would hit the door shelves which are spaced the same as my interior shelves).  I did find a handy alternative location but I would rather have been able to use it at reachable level on my refrigerator\u2019s main shelf.\n"

My friend had this same unit at his house and once I had a taste of the water I was pleasantly surprised that I've been wrong all these years. Prior to buying my water pitcher, I always purchased those 2.5gal water jugs. They were such a pain in the rear to lug. Not to mention it took up lots of valuable kitchen space.I was reluctant to order this model because of the reviews regarding the lid. My friend said he never had issues though. When I made my purchase, I had to send mine right back! My unit had the same lid falling off issue a lot of people complained about in their reviews. I later decided to take my chances and order a replacement though, being as how much I loved the taste of the water, the size of the pitcher, and the cost.  Lucky for me, my second unit hasn't given me any issues. The lid sometimes may budge a little but it doesn't completely pry open or fall off. Just don't overfill it and watch the lid when you pour.I've been reading that this unit actually doesn't filter out lead, or maybe not at the levels where they can legally advertise as so. That's the reasoning behind the minus 1 star. I live in an old house with old pipes which I'm sure probably has lead. I'll need to find a solution for that, but that's another issue.Another note about the filter...make sure it fits in properly! The first time I used it I didn't realize I was putting the filter in wrong. I thought it was snug in it's place, but turns out it wasn't!! So I was drinking just partially filtered water. You can tell if it's seated correctly by the way it fits, but also when you fill the pitcher with water, the water should come out from the bottom of the filter a bit slowly. If it's filling up super fast, it's probably not seated properly!\n"

          "\n  We are pleased with the pitcher, but did run into one design issue that may explain some of the conflicting reviews. It turns out that the top for this pitcher fits tightly when placed with the hinged flap over the pouring spout, as shown in the picture. But fits 99.99% of the way when turned around so that the hinged flap is resting on the handle. As we discovered, if you take the lid off of the pitcher, as you will do to wash the pitcher or put in a new filter, it is quite easy to pick it up and put it back on the wrong way around without realizing it. This has never been an issue with other Britta models.Because we were alert to the \"top doesn't quite fit\" issue for this model from other reviews, we had two people testing it at various stages, with one person saying the top fit tightly and the other saying it didn't. We brought in a third person, who said, \"Doesn't fit.\" The first one said, \"You just press it down,\" tried to do so, found either the front fit or the back did but not both, and then we all three suddenly realized the hinged flap goes in front, not resting on the handle. And then it was fine for everyone.Although the right way round is obvious once you know to look for it, we found that all three of us were mostly placing the top by feel--our eyes tended to be on the container we were going to be pouring into. It was just automatic to scoop up the top, slip it in place, and start pouring. We didn't stop to check the alignment until we knew we had to.I checked our two older Britta pitchers, and on both the top fits either way round. If any Britta designers read these reviews, I suggest they change the future shape of the Grand slightly so it's really obvious by feel that it doesn't fit when placed incorrectly.I like a lot of things about the pitcher. It's much larger capacity than the Slim, but still fit easily on the refrigerator door. It was well balanced. No plastic smell out of the box, unlike some other brands we've tried. The water tastes noticeably crisper than tap. Frustration free packaging. The filter fits tightly and fills pretty quickly.But I can only give it 4 stars because of the top design. It is just a little too easy to get it wrong until you know exactly how it fits, especially if, as all 3 of us did, you're directing your attention to the next step in the process.\n"

During the past 6 months or more when I noticed the PUR filtered water didn't taste as good as at my other home, I was buying 4 cases of bottled water a week defeating the purpose of a faucet filter and relegated the filtered water to making coffee and cooking.Thus far I'm satisfied with Brita and happy not to have to spend money on bottled water anymore.

You must clean the wall surface with alcohol to remove any dirt and let dry which should be quick.  Then adhere the hanger and press and hold for 30 secs.  Then let it sit for a day BEFORE you hang your frame.  I think this allows the adhesive to bond with the wall surface for a tighter grip.

One thing to be aware of - since these gripper hooks sit right up against the wall, they work best for things that are flat and don't stick out too much. For example, if you have a mop with a large bulky head, it may not work as well as a broom that's more flat. I am able to use it for my Rubbermaid Reveal mop, but it requires a bit of manipulating to get it to hang properly. But otherwise, they feel very secure on the wall, and I am very happy with them!\n"

Keep in mind when installing upside down that you will be sliding down to remove the shelf (to push on the adhesive) and putting it back on from the bottom as well, so make sure you don't have anything directly under where you are putting it.

Technically, they're much more heavy-duty than the weight of the board calls for.... which is probably a good thing since it was impossible to follow the application directions! Specifically, the directions call for you to apply the strips to the frame, then to press the frame against the wall for 30 seconds, then to \"temporarily remove frame from wall to reinforce strips\" by pulling the frame off of the wall at an angle (see step 4 in the picture I've provided for an illustration) and then pressing the individual strips to the wall and letting them adhere without weight for an hour. But pulling the frame off at an angle did NOT work! I followed the directions exactly, but the velcro-like strips would not separate. In fact, the strips just came off of the wall itself. I tried everything to get the strips to separate as expected, to no avail.(I've actually had a related experience with these same strips before, so it's not a fluke: They had been used to hang framed posters in an office where I used to work and, when I needed to replace the posters, the velcro-like strips would NOT separate from each other and I ended up pulling the strips and some paint off of the walls.)When I couldn't remove the frame, I just REALLY wanted to get the dry-erase board installed and so I decided to improvise: I pushed the frame against the wall as hard as I could for several minutes in hopes that it would adhere well enough to stay. So far, it's stayed for over 24 hours and shows no give when I try to wiggle it. Good enough for me! I just don't get to benefit from the velcro-like qualities and I think it's pretty darn likely that paint will come off of the wall when I eventually remove the board.I'd say you should consider this product if you have something heavy to hang, but ONLY if you're OK with permanent attachment!\n"

So, I had to improvise and attach cardboard to make a thick piece to hang the strips on, but getting that to stay attached to the frame is tricky.  Many of those pictures keep falling off the wall because they tear off the back of the frame.  Even super glue and gorilla glue don't hold, and these are very light pictures, the kind you get at dollar stores.  The only solution I can think of is for Command to make thicker strips for frames that are not flat.  These work great for my wall hangings that are flat on the back.. even the heavier ones don't fall down.  And, naturally I love that there are no holes in my walls.\n"

The instructions were somewhat unclear as to the connection of a series of strips. For those as bamboozled as myself: cut the end off the first strip, cut the beginning off of the second strip, and use the included plastic snap connectors to create a continuous strip of light. Make sure the strips are in the correct orientation with the contacts matching on both sides. You can bend the metal arms on the inside of the plastic connector if you have difficulty getting the ends of the strips inserted.Otherwise, these are more or less your typical basic LED strips. They provide excellent mood lighting but aren't sufficiently luminous for visually intensive tasks. These particular strips are somewhat lacking in features, with four non-customizable color changing modes and no Bluetooth support. The remote and receiver have enough range for any standard sized bedroom, but the control box must be within line of sight due to the use of infrared. This small issue is exacerbated by the unnecessarily short power lead. The cord is barely able to reach my outlet from 10ft ceilings.One last thing worth mentioning is that these go further than I would have expected. I only needed about two and a half of the four strips included to line the perimeter of my ceiling. Ultimately, I think that these are plenty functional for the price, bearing in mind the caveats previously mentioned.\n"

You have to replace both side pieces where it attaches as well. The side pieces for this set have little notches in them for a small bar that is on the sides of the new nozzle. I triple checked the manual, the Bissell itself, and Amazon to find a match for my machine. This was the only one I could find and I am a little disappointed because it did not have a spot for my cleanshot to go through or attach even though it is listed as a replacement for my machine and does fit otherwise. I ended up having to curl the cleanshot hose down into the side piece and I will not be able to use it.So while this is a replacement set for the 9500 and does fit, if you have the cleanshot attachment you will never be able to use it again.

I jury rigged this by adding a tiny hair rubber band to the end of the hose fitting and doubling another over the formula fitting. This got me halfway to the suction required to actually remove any liquid from carpet or spin the bristles. Now the formula comes out as it should (although it\u2019s not going to soak anything well, more like spraying from a squirt bottle once), and the bristles turn slowly enough that you can see them spinning. I added a patch of electrical tape over the push button where it snaps into place, and that further helped the suction, but the bristles are not going to seriously agitate a major stain. Recommend pretreating and agitating a deep or greasy stain with another brush and then using the head to suck up the gunk.The suction is pretty decent and leaves carpet just as damp as the main vacuum does.

It is big enough for the two of us, though only just. I care about filtering suspended particles only in that I do not want them in my coffee maker. In so far as I can tell the pitcher does what it is supposed to do and in doing its thing, we have no indications that our coffee maker is becoming fouled with suspended solids.Among the features that play out for us, the locking lid can be tricky. It pays off in reducing spills, esp when we have water in the reservoir while we add water to the coffee maker. . I know that it is filtering at least some of the suspended solids because when we finally changed the filter is had more than doubled in weight and we could see some of the particulate backed up in the filter.This brings us to the feature I do not trust, or have found trust worthy: The indicator light. Exactly how it senses the status of the filters is unknown. I suspect and have some reason to that it is a simple counter that counts down based on, perhaps the number of times you press the on button. Otherwise I suspect it is designed to promote sales of replacement filters more than designed to track the condition of the filter. When we notice that it was taking more time to filter water and look to see the status of the filter is when we change the filter. Our way takes no electronics and gave us the result we wanted. I have never seen the indicator light be anything but green.Disassembly is very hard. If you are picky about having the ability to clean in detail, our experience has not been positive. We can clean it sufficient for our sensitivities.Overall we like our Brita Large 10 Cup Water Filter Pitcher. If that is all there was to say; it functions mostly as promised and is deserving of four stars. However I am suspicious of the electronics; do not believe they are needed and cannot witness to its reliability.\n"

          "\n  \u00a0We've been using Brita pitcher systems since 2012 and the promise of the new Stream pitcher system was pretty attractive to us at first - Cut the wait times associated with traditional pitcher filter systems and have instant filtered water. However in reality I was actually left underwhelmed with what it offered and there were too many compromises, with what was I was okay with, in order to achieve a flow that is only a moderate at best and unuseable at its worst. Here's why I feel this way :FILTRATION & CONTAMINANT REMOVAL- The whole point of any filtration system to remove most of the harmful contaminants in the water we drink and here's where I feel most of the compromises were made to achieve a 'fast' flow- I've included a pic taken from Brita's own website comparing the contaminant removal from their own filtration systems. As you can see the stream filters *only removes* the Chlorine taste from your tap water and if you cant notice the Chlorine taste in you water in the first place (like In my area)  then there is really no difference drinking straight from the tap or through this filter- Unlike standard pitcher & faucet filters, It *does not* filter out harmful chemicals like Mercury, Nickel , Copper, Zinc , Cadmium etc- The Stream filters are only good for 40 gallons and at the time of writing this review cost about $6.46 a pop ($19.39 for a 3 pack).  Compare that to Brita's own regular pitcher filters which cost about $4.89 for a filter ( $14.69 for 3 Pack). The regular pitcher filters are also good for 40 gallons- You can see where I'm going about the Value proposition for the Stream filters - They are about 30% more expensive than the regular filter , yet they remove only 1/5th (20%) of the contaminants the regular pitcher does ( 1 v/s 5) . I mean why pay top dollar when you can have better filtered water from the same brand for lessWATER FLOW RATES- So the whole point of all the above compromises was a faster water flow , however as you can see from my video that the flow rate from the pitcher (when its full and has the most pressure against the filter) is only moderate at best- This flow rate gets progressively slower as your pitcher empties and slows down to significantly once the pitcher is half empty and the water level looses contact with the filter- Once you reach the last quarter of the pitcher , the flow slows down to almost a trickle making it a test of your patience and forcing you to refill the pitcher again. This makes a 10 cup pitcher more  like a '7 cup actually usable' to meTHE GOOD- The pitcher is good looking and looks great on any table- Fits your fridge door easily and can filter iced water- Tight seal , the pitcher does not leak no matter how high you tilt it- Better than drinking tap water alone (That is if the water in your area has a strong chlorine odor/taste)THE NOT SO GOOD- The value proposition just doesn't cut it for me , When compared to Brita's own regular pitcher filters , it removes 80% lesser contaminants for 30% higher the cost. And I'm not even talking about faucet filters or other brands here.- On top of that the water flow rate did not turn out to be the redeeming quality I sought it to be as it gets progressively slower as you empty the pitcher making a 10 cup pitcher more like a 7 Cup oneFINAL THOUGHTSIn the end, though the Brita filter not bad by any means, but I feel there are too many compromises and that you can do so much better for both in terms of cost and quality of filtered water. So there you have it . At one end, With the Stream Pitcher you have \"fast\" filtered water which is more expensive and has fewer contaminants removed and at the other end you have Cheaper, Healthier filtered water for less with a regular Pitcher with the only caveat that you have to wait ~5 mins for the water to filter. And that was an easy decision for me ...\n"

This sat on the counter for a few days while we tried to figure out how to get it apart.  The instruction booklet is a total fail.I finally found a YouTube video that showed how to put soapy water into the clear bin, then turn it upside down (in the sink!).  Let the soapy water run between the two layers of plastic; it will allow you to carefully separate the pieces so you can wash it.The spigot handle feels very flimsy, and I suspect this will be the first thing to break.  The spigot is set in quite far, so you'll have to drag the dispenser a few inches over the edge of your countertop or refrigerator shelf.We do like the large size.

I am withholding that 4th star because it really takes too much effort to get the filter to stay put.___________________________Original review.I've been using a PUR pitcher for several years but decided that I wanted a larger pitcher so that, when I'm cooking, I don't have to wait for more water to filter on through. I had a Brita years ago, and so, when I got a deal for some dollars off (don't remember the exact amount), I opted to give this pitcher a try.The pitcher holds a good amount of water which is fabulous, sort of, when I'm cooking. The sad truth is that, while there is certainly more water in the pitcher, I cannot access it all because the filter falls out when I tip the pitcher over to pour out the last half of the water. This is a huge flaw and defeats the purpose of having the larger pitcher. It seems to me, that in days past, the filter was given a bit of a turn which locked it in place.That flaw aside, the water tastes much nicer than straight tap water.\n"

          "\n  This is a review of the Command Outdoor Refill Strips.I bought these strips to use to affix a 4 oz Blink Outdoor camera to the new vinyl siding on our garage.  The Command strips are rated to hold up to 3 pounds.Two days ago, I used rubbing alcohol to clean the area I intended to stick the Blink camera mount to.  I stuck the non-wall side of the Command Strip to the Blink\u2019s lightweight plastic mount. Then, I pressed the mount against the vinyl siding and held it there for one minute, to assure a secure bond between the mount and the siding.Yesterday, I attached the Blink camera to the mount.  The Command Strip seemed to be holding everything securely in place.  So far, so good.This morning, I discovered that the Command Strip had almost completely separated from the vinyl siding, leaving the camera only moments away from crashing to the concrete below.  But, the side of the tape attached to the back of the camera mount remained securely in place.The temperature in our area ranged from approximately 59\u00b0, down to approximately 30\u00b0 F, between the time I affixed the camera mount to the vinyl siding, and the time I attached the camera to the mount.  The tape is rated to be applied between 15\u00b0 & 125\u00b0 F.I\u2019ve been successfully using 3M Command products for years, but this one failed the test.\n"

They really do hold their designated weight well, are easy to use, and come off the surface leaving no marks.I got these hooks for various small hanging tasks, among which are lightweight pictures. They will work for such, though the instructions that came with them insist they shouldn't be used with pictures, at all. I'm not sure what difference it makes in the long run.One thing that was annoying is these hooks are the anti-fancy. They are plain, to the point of being best used in service spaces. They will always be visible above whatever you use them for.Also, if you use them for something that you will often remove from the hook, such as keys, the hook isn't stationary. It' isn't attached to the wall in any way--only the white base is. So every time you lift something off the hook the hook lifts too, creating a bit of a tangle to get the thing off the hook. I'd rather the hooks be fully adhered to the base and not move.Also, I did not receive the correct number of hooks and adhesives in my box. I only received 14 hooks. I would get Command hooks again, though not from this vendor, and not this style.\n"

From what I have read, it broke the way most people report: the plastic piece that attaches to the wall, door, etc., breaks off of the dryer holder.Now, how to fix it:You need to have more Command strips, but they need to be the \"velcro\" kind.You also need superglue, or whatever brand you prefer.Glue the plastic part that attaches to the wall (or whatever) to the part that holds the dryer. Make sure you follow your adhesive's advice on how long to let it set before proceeding.When the glue has dried, attach two Command \"velcro\" strips to the back of the glued together holder. Let them set for a minute or two, then attach two more Command \"velcro\" style strips to the ones you just attached (you just push them together so that the velcro sticks).Peel the backs the of the Command strips that you just velcro-ed to the holder so that the adhesive is exposed and hold it firmly against whatever surface you are attaching it to. After a minute or so, you should be able to peel off the holder leaving the Command strips attached to the surface. Let this be for several hours or overnight.After setting you can re-attach the holder to the Command strips and you are done.The advantage of this is if you accidentally cause the holder to come off of the wall (say by pushing too hard) you simply push it back onto the Command strips.Also, this fix allows you to completely remove the holder if you decide you don't want it after all. The \"velcro\" style Command strips have the same blemish protection other Command strips do.\n"

          "\n  These strips are a nice alternative to putting nails & screws in the wall, and an even greater alternative when you have a surface that you are unable to nail or screw; they are perfect for normal weight picture frames.  Although I continue to purchase this product and use them, I only give it three stars for two reasons:  1.  They are not consistently safe for painted wall surfaces.  I have quality paint on my walls, but these strips still sometimes take the paint off when I remove the strips, so it's a risky hit or miss in this area.  2.)  Even though the adhesive holds up 95% of the time, I am not confident enough to use them to hang something valuable on the wall, because occasionally they do fail, but again they are great for your average weight picture frames.Sidenote:  Even though they sometimes peel the paint after they've been in place for awhile, i've never had them peel the paint when i've had to immediately remove them to reposition when i've accidently hung them crooked, etc.  So rest assured, there is room for error when you need to immediately peel off to reposition, and it does't seem to affect the strength of the adhesive for the most part.\n"

          "\n  We just remodeled our kitchen and I didn't want my sponges sitting on the new counter top for all to see so I ordered these for the inside of the cabinet doors under the sink. The directions were a bit hazy on how to put the tray back on the holders because it looks like they tell you to slide it on but I couldn't and almost broke the first one. Seems you need to put it part way on then slide it up into place. I didn't take any changes with the second one and just left it in one piece when I attached it to the cabinet (I still was able to push where the tape is through the thing, it is plastic)  since the part that slides into the 'clips' that hold it up are thin plastic and as I said, I almost broke the first one just trying to get it on. They do come with a sponge (scrubber part on other side) which is nice but those trays can't hold much else but the one sponge the long way. When I tried to stand the sponge up and stick a second one in the tray and close the cabinet door, the sponges just toppled out. The tray is too shallow to let sponges stand up in them as you can see in the photo, it don't even come half way up. (The second photo shows where it comes up on the sponge the long way which still isn't that high but I didn't have any problems with it falling out.) While these are okay for now, I will be looking for something a little more sturdy and I can fit a couple of sponges in. I really didn't want holes in the inside of the cabinet but these (even the one I put on as directed) are a bit wobbly and I don't expect they will last that long. (Good news is they do give you extra set of strips so if it does fall off, you can put it back on.) With all this being said, the item does what it claims (at least so far) so I won't take stars off for that but I did take some off because of the problems putting it on and the wobble.\n"

The first few quarts dispensed by the in-door dispenser at first appeared cloudy, but when allowed to stand, quickly cleared since the cloudiness is actually very fine air bubbles.Flow decreases gradually as the fiilter loads with use as is expected of any filter doing its job. Our water in Palm Bay, FL has possibly lower particulates than average, so I was able to 'reset' the automatic reminder on our fridge (by removing and immediately reinstalling the same filter) several times before replacing the filter with a new one when flow decreased roughly by 50%.The filter itself consists of a thin cloth-like outer membrane surrounding an activated compressed powdered charcoal core. (See uploaded photos.) This might be compared to a 'finishing' filter in an RO system. If your fridge is connected to a reverse-osmosis system with such a filter, you might be able to skip replacement of this filter and only change the RO filters as needed.)I'm not sure why this filter is so expensive except that it's form-factor is quite specific to this model refrigerator and would be difficult to bypass or replace without considerable effort. Hence the 3 stars. This seems to be Whirlpool's attempt to tap into the 'subscription model' of continuous revenue after the sale for the life of the fridge. <mutter, grumble, grumble> :)\n"

          "\n  Last Spring I purchased a magnetic screen for my  96\" by 36\" patio door.  It was easy to install; basically just adhering the Velcro tape and using a several tacks to reinforce it. A few months later we hired a painter to paint and refinish all exterior doors. This required taking down the Velcro tape holding up the screen door. I ordered the 20 feet new installation kit to reinstall my screen door. It was fine except IT WAS ONLY 17 FEET, not the 20 feet it was supposed to be. I needed a total of 19.5 feet for my installation. I literally had to salvage several small pieces of the old Velcro tape to make it 19.5 linear feet that I needed to reinstall my magnetic screen door. The kit itself was fine if it had actually contained 20 feet, rather than 17 feet. Now I have the worry that instead of using three long new Velcro pieces, I have three new long pieces and three reused short pieces of Velcro holding up my screen door. I hope the used pieces last but it would not have been necessary if they had not shorted me 36 inches of Velcro tape.\n"

The original tool held up for a couple of years of light use, then eventually cracked around the spray nozzle, resulting in a drip/stream of cleaner running out the bottom of the tool rather than the nice wide spray.I purchased a replacement directly from Bissel, and they had clearly altered the material with a different type of plastic.  The new brush suffered the exact same problem as the original after just a couple of uses.  I ordered another, thinking that I was being too rough with the brush.  The second replacement cracked in the exact same way after just 2 or 3 uses, despite my being particularly gentle with it.  Since I'd ordered twice from Bissel, I contacted them and they sent me another replacement free of charge.The 3rd replacement suffered the same fate, though I'm not sure after how many uses (maybe ten?).  Obviously, these things are pieces of junk, so I figured I'd try to find them cheaper and \"stock up\".  I ordered a couple from Amazon...yes, these are the OEM Bissel tools...and as expected, the first one I used only lasted a couple of uses.Generally, I will continue to use the tool until the spray nozzle is cracked so bad that it sprays formula all over my hand, then replace it.  The suction is unaffected, so I've gotten used to just drizzling the spray onto the area to be cleaned, sometimes even removing the brush tool from the handle to do so.Anyway, these aren't crazy expensive, but they do have a pretty short lifespan.  Buy a couple if you're shopping for a replacement.It's also worth mentioning that the TubroBrush attachment that comes with some of the Little Green models suffers from this same issue.  I'm now on my second one of those, which I hardly ever use.I give it two stars because it works well for as long as it is intact (a 1-star if it didn't work at all).  Couldn't give it a 3-star rating, though, simply because it breaks far too easily.  I wonder if the plastic they use is affected by the chemicals in the cleaning solution.\n"

You will need some little zip ties and several different sized Philips screw drivers, needle nose pliers and glue gun. Remove both tanks from machine.  You will find 4 screws.  Remove and set aside.  Have little bowls to put screws so you don't get confused on the order of replacing.  Lift the cover off carefully.  I was unable to disconnect the switches and the indicator light so carefully support the top so you do not damage the connections.  You will see a housing covering the motor you will need to remove.  First take off the top (4 little screws) and set aside.  On either end you will need to remove the screws that hold the housing to the base. You will also see some thick rubber rings.  They support the motor and cover the access to the screws  that need removed.  You will need a longer Phillips screw driver for that.  Carefully take out the motor in the housing and careful not to disconnect any wires or tubes. Remove housing and set aside.  Once removed, you can access the pump and remove. You will have to cut the zip tie off to get the hose off.  I had to take the motor apart in pieces because I could not get the bottom hose to release from the pump. There was also part of the motor glued to the base.  It is easy to remove with a knife (be gentle) Once everything is out, you ate going to have to drill new holes to connect the motor to the base.  Re glue.  Replace zip tie or ties.  Replace housing and rubber supports. etc.  If you have any questions, message me, I will do my best to respond.

These filters are ridiculously overpriced for what they do. You can buy a 6 pack of original Bissell vacuum cleaner filters for a little more than the cost of one of these Febreze filters. Just spray the stock filter with Febreze, or whatever your favorite air freshener might be, and save a whole lot of money.

          "\n  I live in a multi-cat home and have dark hardwood floors throughout. My typical cleaning regimen was robot vacuum during the week, then weekends I would manually vacuum and then steam mop. Very time consuming, but it worked. When my steam mop died, I saw this product and thought it would be great to cut my time about in half. Unfortunately I'm really not a fan. The vacuum suction is great, but I've used 3 times now and have found that less than midway through cleaning I am getting streaks of dirty water. I tried stopping and emptying out that chamber (even though it's not full) and rinsing the brush with water in the tray as recommended, but then a few minutes back at it and it's happening again. I also have to scrape clumped wet hair and litter from the bottom of the broom a few times during cleaning. And this is just cleaning my open floor plan kitchen/living room/dining room, not the whole house. Also, because there is one chamber that collects both the liquid and the dry mess, it is incredibly gross to clean out. I had litter and hair mixed with dirty water and I have to use my hands to get it all out. Pouring it in the sink seems gross to me but the alternative is toilet or outside so I've been pouring as much liquid in the sink and then the wet solids in the trash and then have to sterilize the sink. I think a separate chamber for liquid and solid would be ideal but not sure if that can be designed! I feel like I can't really return it since I've used it so I plan to use the vacuum part of it and then just steam mop after like I used to. This is an excellent premise, but it really doesn't work for me.UPDATE: I have now had this for another month of use and am still not happy. I thought maybe it wasn't for cat houses but see other reviews where it works for cats. I feel like the small amounts of litter particles on the floor end up getting wet and clumping (as litter does) on the bottom of the vacuum so every 5-10 minutes I need to stop and get a paper towel to scrape away wet clumps of hair mixed with a little litter. And I get dirty water streaks on the floor right off the bat, so it's not like it's clogging after a while of use.  It happens with rinsed out parts/brush and empty debris compartment. Maybe mine has a defect so I do plan to call. It's really frustrating to spend an hour or two cleaning and then having floors streaked with dirty water.\n"

However, as others customers have noted, the filter does not have a sealed/tight fit at all. In fact, if the pitcher is filled to 3/4 or more full, the water displaces the filter, so that it actually rises out of the slot.

I have had this filter for a month now and it is a real pain every time I need to refill the pitcher. I thought buying this filter rather than 3 at a time would save packaging and also not have to think about replacing a filter every month or so. If I had known that this filter would take about 3 hours to filter water every time I filled the pitcher, I would have kept ordering the regular filters. I understand that since this is a longer lasting filter, that the filter will take longer to purify the tap water. But waiting 3 hours each fill up is beyond excessive. It's gotten to the point that I can't possibly keep this for another 2-4 months until I need to replace it. It is aggravating to say the least. Especially since it's summer and we drink a lot more water this time of year. We might pass out from dehydration before the pitcher fills with cleaned water!I have taken the steps that other's have mentioned: taking out the filter and hitting it a bit to get air bubbles out (doesn't help), re-soaking & running the filter under cold water for 15 seconds (doesn't help) and I've made sure that the filter has been properly inserted and created a seal.Bottom line, this is a filter for water and it does just that. But a 3 hour water fill up is unacceptable. I have been using Brita filters for at least 15 years now and have never had a problem like this one. I will be replacing this filter with the regular filters from now on. I just wish I could get my money back for such a crummy product.\n"

To make them work for triangle hangers, you need the much more expensive \"universal\" hangers, which are metal and can also accommodate wire hangers. These flimsy plastic ones are too expensive for what they can do--they should be one-third the price, or at least have a different shape so that they can work with a wider range of hangers.

          "\n  There was once a time when I would have given this product a glowing 5 star review. I loved this these hooks when I first discovered them; the walls in my home are practically made from concrete which makes putting nails in extremely difficult bordering on nearly impossible.I had several pieces hanging on my walls using different sized strips/hooks, all of which were hung around 5 to 6 years ago (maybe longer) over a period of approximately a year+. The product worked exactly as intended until suddenly a few months ago I hear a loud noise in another room and discover a framed piece had fallen from the wall. After all this time the adhesive backing completely failed completely, the back of the hook was no longer sticky at all.I assumed it was a freak accident and a few weeks to a month later the same exact thing happened (luckily this piece was hung using two hooks and only one failed). Still being a huge fan of the product I really didn't give the situation the critical eye that I should have. Skip ahead maybe another two months and this time something that had been hanging for years fell off the wall in front of my eyes because the adhesive suddenly failed. I really don't know what to make of the situation, there wasn't any extreme weather that might have caused a problem and all instructions were followed when installed.My best guess is that the adhesive material dried out over time. Reading other reviews I see cases where the hooks fail after weeks or even months but not years. This product was still fairly new to the market when my pieces were hung; could it be that the hooks have a shelf life and will undoubtedly fail given enough time? Are the hooks only designed to last a certain amount of time before drying up or losing adhesion? I couldn't imagine one of these things for 50 years (something a nail should have no problem with), what about 20 years or 10? If the product has a lifespan that it's the manufacturers duty to inform us of that estimated lifespan even if it is multiple decades.I still have the problem of the nearly impenetrable walls and am extremely tempted to continue using them with the caveat that replacement will be necessary after 2 - 3 years and with an additional hook to backup the first one should it fail (which was what happened with the 2nd of the 3 failures I had).I don't want to say the product is totally useless because it's not, I just think it's important people recognize the possible shelf life that the product may have.\n"

I purchased several 3M items at the same time including 3 of these Clear Caddy holders for my spices in Large and Medium sizes.  The actual containers fit perfect in my cabinets, unfortuately the clear adhesive strips they came with were awful.  The strips were clear but so thin, about as thin as double sided tape.  I figured since I planned to place some weight in them I decided to use all 4 strips for each caddy.  I installed a couple inside the cabinet door and another on a nearby wall and waited overnight before placing anything in them.  I wanted to give the adhesive time to stick.  The next day all seemed well. I tugged on the caddys and they seemed to have a strong hold. I placed 4 standard size \"plastic\" spice containers in the medium size ones and small nick-nack items in the large one.  I was happy, they held well.  An hour later I came back to load up more items in the cabinet, only to see all the caddy's had fallen down.  It was obvious the strips were not thick or strong enough to form a good enough seal between the caddy and cabinet or wall.In the end I had to go out and purchase more adhesive strips, an additional cost I was not happy about.  I decided on the thicker white foam ones because I knew they would have a better hold than the flimsy thin clear ones.  They held strong and 2 weeks later they show no signs of fall off.  So in my review I give the Caddy's a 5 star for functionality, but for the strips that came with them I'd give it a -3 stars.  -1 Star because 3M should have tested them better,  another -2 stars because I had to go out and buy additional replacement strips for each caddy.

The first one happened in the middle of the night, what a scary wake up moment that was. All four were damaged and needed to be replaced, including a frame and print that I've had for over ten years which was torn when the frame broke upon hitting the wood flooring. Another fell behind the desk it was hung over and damaged both the frame and the desk.For what it's worth, my home is climate controlled and in most cases these frames fell off the walls when no-one was home. We have no children and no pets, don't smoke or throw wild parties. The drywall and paint these are hanging from were clean and new when I hung everything up.I'm pretty confident that I didn't do anything wrong while installing. Instead I think the strips simply dried up and let go.  I gave two stars in this review only because 11 out of the 15 frames are still hanging. Still I wouldn't recommend using this product for anything of value.\n"

          "\n  Very disappointing as have used other Command Hooks for over a decade - even re-re-used them - and no damage whatsoever.  With these it was right out of the gate - Scuffed Up Paint.  Glad I tested these out on a wall that can be touched up before placing them on a surface that would be harder to repair.Basic Info:Have some custom shelves that I wanted to add some hooks to the side WITHOUT damaging the woodwork.  These \"double hooks\" looked to be ideal as could get twice the storage space in a very tight spot.  As the plastic Large White Command Hooks did so well, figured I'd give these BATH36s a try.  Again, glad I tested it out on a wall first as I can either Magic Eraser the scratches (if I am lucky) or just hit a few dabs of paint with a Q-tip or something.  :)Testing (see pics):Did not want to waste the \"blue\" (moisture) strips so used some of my pre-existing regular command strips as they looked to be the same size, shape, thickness, etc.  Followed instructions about attaching to back, pressing, then sliding up to press on just the strip... HEY?  WHERE DID THOSE MARKS ON THE WALL COME FROM?Working backwards...I put the hook back on the plastic piece (veeeeery carefully) and noticed that the \"metal hook\" was not a 100% tight fit on the \"plastic\" piece the adhesive attaches to.  It wiggles a bit, and Wobbly Metal + Other Surfaces = Trouble.  I also noticed two pieces of metal on the bottom rear.  Not sure if that is what scuffed the wall, and wasn't eager to make things worse by further experimentation.  Perhaps the issue may be related to the fact that the strip area is Too Short compared to the rest of the piece.  I compared the identical size/shape strips to the existing Command Hooks I am currently using, and the older Command Hooks are only slightly \"taller\" than the strips.  These BATH36-SN-ES have a sizable difference between the length of the metal portion and shorter the length of the plastic mounting piece..  The leftover difference would mean it has a \"gap\" and that would mean a potential Wobble.Jury Rig?I was tempted to get some \"metal tape\" (to match the hook's finish) and just tape over the bottom rear of the hooks to keep it from potentially scratching anything, then figured it would be safer just try to buy something else.  This was a worthy effort, but was not meant to be.  I have some of the larger Command \"bath\" single-hooks still in the packaging somewhere, so perhaps I could stage those very close together.  Will test it out somewhere safe (like on a 2x4) before trying out on actual woodwork.  Or maybe will just buy a small \"coat rack\" for the nearby wall.  I can always repaint (or touch up) drywall, but it's harder to touch up or repair scarred up bookshelves, tile, etc.  Then again, metal would certainly \"scratch\" more than plastic would.  If the plastic mounting piece was a little longer, this wouldn't be an issue.  Perhaps in a future release?  :)\n"

My refrigerator is a Kenmore (actually a Whirlpool) side by side 106.53332300 (purchased back in 2003). I was concerned about reviews regarding this filter not working so I wrote to the company and I will include their response to me in my review. I've attached a photo of what the manufacturer info says on my filter package and as you will see from the response from Whirlpool, the filters made by 3M may be an issue for older refrigerators.--------------------------Thank you for contacting Whirlpool Consumer Direct Sales through our website.I am happy to assist you with your water filter questions.You are correct. Your replacement water filter is EDR5RXD1. That being said, we have noticed that older model refrigerators in the 8-10 year old range or older have had some issues with one of our newer filter. We do have two manufactures for this filter and with these models we have noticed that one will work and the other will be very difficult to install. It is possible but very difficult. Our engineers are working on a solution to this issue.If you order directly from us, our warehouse will ship what they have in stock and we have no control over which one they ship. If you are purchasing your filter at the store you can differentiate which one you are purchasing. On the bottom left side of the box you will see where it says \"manufactured for Whirlpool\" then it will say by.. and it will either say Kemflo or 3M for the manufacturer. If you look at the old filter you have been using you will either see it is flat at the top or has cut out notches in the top. One of these two filters will match the one that you have been using. I believe it is the one made by Kemflo that is working with the older models.We do have a 30 day return policy and a 90 day warranty so if you do order by phone and get one that doesn't work we would replace it for you. As of right now we just have no way to know which one the warehouse will be shipping. We hope to have a better solution for you soon. I do apologize for the inconvenience.Thank you for your email. Have a great day.If you have any additional questions or concerns, you may also reach our retail parts department at 1-800-901-2042 and choose the water filters option. Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m.to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.You are a valued Whirlpool customer and we appreciate your support of the Whirlpool Brand. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to assist you today. Have a good day!Sincerely,Billie P.Whirlpool Consumer Direct Sales-------------------------------------The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I find it very upsetting that there is this manufacturing issue where if you order the filter on any online source even through Whirlpool you can't know if it will fit until you get it!. With the original filter I never had to worry about that because it always worked. I sincerely hope Whirlpool will take this seriously and solve this engineering issue soon.----------------------------------------New Update, The filter I got from Amazon was the one made in Mexico. Although I was able to install it (it had a rounded top), my refrigerator had small water leaks at the dispenser for the 6 months that it was installed. It was minor or I would have changed the filter sooner but still annoying considering it is supposed to be the correct filter. Now I have the correct filter that I had to spend more money to purchase in town, made by Kemflo that has the notches on top and fits correctly. I downgraded my review to 2 stars because of the problem with having 2 manufacturers that make this same filter different causing fit and use issues.Basically, you will be taking your chances buying this filter online because you won't know which one you will get..\n"

I went research why, and it turns out that Bissell used to have a different PowerForce Compact model with a slightly different design. Then it discontinued that model and launched a different vaccuum with a very similar, just just slightly different, design, and that includes a roller brush that is about 1-inch shorter than the original.So the original PowerForce Compact brush won't work in the second PowerForce Compact, but the company makes that really hard to figure out until you get the wrong part. Why would you change the design, use two brushes that are visually identical, but make one slightly shorter and then put it in a vacuum with the exact same name?Now I paid $15 for a brush that doesn't fit my vacuum. The roller brush for the new vacuum is $5 more expensive even though it is smaller. I'm paranoid about ordering it because what if there's some magical third PowerForce Compact with a slightly different roller brush size?If you're going to discontinue a vacuum and change its core parts, Bissell, you need to give it a different name so your customers aren't left with this hassle and frustration. It's annoying trying to find entirely different parts for two entirely different products sold under the exact same names.EDIT: Here's an edit to help customers in a way that Bissell doesnt:This roller brush is for the older discontinued PowerForce Compact 23T7V which is NOT the same PowerForce Compact it sells, which is now the PowerForce Compact 2112. If you've purchased your PowerForce Compact in the relatively recent past, new, you've likely got the 2112, not the 23T7V.If you have the PowerForce Compact 2112, not 23T7V, you need the Roller Brush Part # 1606837, NOT Roller Brush #2037627.Bissell should be making this bright and clear since it decided to use the exact same name for two different vacuums with different parts.\n"

I have left the original (tearing up) foam filter around the new set, as it didn't come with the second foam filter, but the replacement unit is so much smaller than the original outer foam filter that they don't touch anywhere, so air will not be forced to go through it, but will take the path of least resistance.  It's sad that companies simply won't make quality items.  The originals are junkie enough, to insure us having to replace them soon and often.  This replacement is so much junkier.

Hoover's never seem to measure up, no matter how well-reviewed they are, yet, somehow, even a moderately reviewed Bissell will do a wonderful job of cleaning and drying carpet. However, this attachment simply doesn't measure up. It is not designed to spray more or in a wider path in order to cover the area needed. Apparently, underspray is an issue with this model attachment (hence the reasonable price). The larger heads, sized between this and the standard 3\" attachment, all spray better than this, if instructions are followed. Not so on this model. What is the point of a larger head if you still have to pass over the sides and spray several more times before scrubbing? It ends up taking just as long as spraying and scrubbing and then moving on in an orderly fashion. After finding out this underspray issue is related to the spray power of the unit versus the size of this attachment, I returned to using my turbo and deep reach tools, which I love so much  more than I should ever love any housecleaning apparatus.Good luck finding what works for you.\n"

They were new and shiny, plus they looked exactly the same as the original pads.

Not only did the cheap fibers melt, it also left dirty \"plastic\" streaks on my white floor!I wasn't happy that I had to get on my hands and knees and scrub like my life depended on it to try to get the marks up and leave before the realtor arrived.

          "\n  UPDATE 7/11/18:OK, I like to shop around. But I was very disappointed with the performance of some generic filters. Even at half the cost of the brand, They were no bargain. The brand name version has a better foam ring filter (I.e., easier to clean) and \u201cfoot\u201d on the base of the hard-sided filter that fits snugly in the vacuum dust cup. I strongly advise you to buy the brand name version: ask then seller before you hit the \u201corder now\u201d button.********So, I purchased two packages of this filter, and I\u2019m really regretting it now. I previously bought generic Bissell filters which work far better than thiese. The primary problem is the filters do no fit snugly in the lower dust cup, So when the vacuum is operating they tend to come loose. So I\u2019m burning through HEPA filters like mad because there\u2019s so much dust getting through. The second problem is, unlike previous filters I have used, this once it\u2019s lower in the dust cup\u2014 the plastic ring on the bottom of the filter is too low, so the dust gets trapped under it rather than going into the upper cup. Finally, the foam outer filter is just bad \u2013 \u2013 it\u2019s too dense so the air flow Isn\u2019t optimized and if he comes quickly clogged with dust. Call me very unsatisfied.p.s., I noticed that my very negative review is appearing on other comparable products. I want to be clear that the generics I ordered in April 2018 were SOLD BY Merchandise Mecca in a 2-pack. My review is specifically about the merchandise, not the seller.\n"

I didn't need a whole house steam cleaning system, I only had three small areas in my bedroom (I blame the kids or the cats, maybe both), that I needed to touch up, and based on the reviews, this seemed like the machine to do it. Initially, I had nothing but positive things to say about this product, the ease of use, assembly, portability, etc, until the results were in, and this machine did not remove the stains in my carpet.  Here are the details:WHAT I LIKED:-Assembly.  It was easy - just a few hose attachments to snap on, and your product is assembled, took less than 10 minutes.-Included items.  I liked that this product came with a 3-inch tough stain remover brush and a deep cleaning tool.  It also came with an 8 fl oz trial size Oxy spot and stain formula ready mixed for out of the box cleaning.-Lightweight.  I was able to haul this machine up and down stairs even with the water tank filled, no problem.  It weighed about 10 pounds, with the water.-When I emptied the water after cleaning the small stained areas (approximately 3 inches in diameter on my carpet)  water was filthy - I was pleased that it looked like it had cleaned something....however, read below.THE DEALBREAKERS:-It didn't get the spots out of my carpet.  They may be fainter, but they are not gone, and this is even with me pre-treating the spots and following the Bissell instructions to the letter.  Yes, the water was dirty, so I'm sure it did something, but I was expecting the spot (which was just grime, not nail polish or anything permanent) to be easily removed.  I've honestly had better luck using a spray bottle of Resolve carpet cleaner for less hassle than breaking this thing out.-Short hose.  15ft.  I was definitely on my hands and knees using this machine.  Not convenient perhaps for those who don't want to or can't crawl around on their floor.-Heatwave technology is advertised to maintain consistent water temperature while cleaning.  Let's just say the water was consistently tepid to cold throughout the cleaning and should be more aptly named Coldwave Technology.  Perhaps the lack of any water temp is why the spots wouldn't lift.-Spray nozzle.  The cleaning heads contains a spray trigger so you can spray the solution while you use the scrubbing tool. The spray didn't really go where I pointed it, and it ended well outside the area I wanted to clean.  It also soaked the carpet, taking 24 hours to dry these areas completely.-Dirty water tank hard to empty with one small drain plug.Disappointed that a name I've long associated with cleaning (Bissell) could make a product that frankly fails to live up to the basic job it was created to do - spot treat a carpet and lift dirt.  I'll be renting a whole house carpet cleaner instead.\n"

So I poured the same water through the filter again, and wiped the leftover specs from my cup, while it filtered. When I poured it again, I saw the black specs again!... Even after filtering it a 3rd time, I still saw specs. Less than the first time, but still unnerving.I decided to compare, and see if it's stuff from the unfiltered water, getting through. So I poured a cup of straight tap, and THAT was actually CLEAR. I don't know if during the filtration process, the metals clump together, and THAT'S what I see as specs.

We only filter 1 or 2 pitchers per day so there's no reason each filter shouldn't last 6 months (stated on carton as 3X standard filter, which is 2 months).  After contacting Brita to complain, they shipped 6 standard filters as replacements.Given the math, we should have received 9 standard filters to compensate for the bad ones.  Also, we purchased the longlife filter because of the capacity to filter out lead.  I don't see any rating on the standard filters, I sure hope it does.  Given the extremely high volume of complaints against the longlife filter, it is unconscionable that this product hasn't been completely removed from sale - both here and in stores.  The company obviously have a major problem with this product, the fact that they are still available speaks volumes about the manufacturer's ethics.The pitcher is ok but I highly discourage anyone considering buying the longlife filter.

Unless you have no kids, no husbands, no bumping accidents ever, this is not the pitcher for you.  I had one of these years ago and the plastic was thicker and sustained several drops from the counter over a couple years' time.  Whether the company has decided to cheap out and make the plastic thinner and/or brittle and more likely to break/crack in that time, I don't know, but I had this pitcher less than a month before the top fell off the counter while I was washing the base and just cracked from top to bottom of the top portion.  And I have marmoleum now, which is kinder to glass and plastic drops than the ceramic tile I had then. I now use the bottom portion to water my potted plants. Lord knows what I'll do with all the expensive filters I bought.I recommend a metal water filter (something like a Berkey, if you are curious about what I mean) when, inevitably, your cheap, brittle Brita breaks.  Metal ones are lots more expensive, but you'll only have to buy one.  Nice because you can fill refillable bottles and not buy all those plastic individual bottles.  You may get the purchase price back in a year, depending on how much water you buy. No, I don't have any stock in any water filters.  I'm just irritated.On another note, and separate from my dissatisfaction and anger with the Brita company: If you live in the PNW and you have any concerns about The Big One, the earthquake that might soon, essentially, separate everyone west of I-5 from the rest of the country and from utilities, like tap water, for a  month or two, a more effective, larger water filter for stream and rainwater might be a good idea anyway.

Of course, as has become typical of the produce of this age, that iteration is not to our benefit, but to theirs. The driving principle behind this product is clearly designed obsolescence. Specifically, the lid that goes on top is only held on by friction between a thin layer of plastic on the lid and the pitcher body itself. You have to more or less bend that thin plastic liner to force/pop the lid on and off of the pitcher to refill it. Not only is this actually considerably difficult relative to what it should be for a task you have to do so often (fill up your water pitcher...), but it's obvious that it will eventually lead to material fatigue of the lid. The lid will break and lose its stay attached of its own accord and needlessly leave you with yet another useless hunk of plastic to throw into the sea.I find it particularly insulting that a Brita was not sufficiently pleased with the legitimate selling of replacement filters, but also felt the need to design their products not last any meaningful amount of time.

We used a Brita pitcher before and it didn't hold much so we were constantly filling it up, then the lid broke (it was only a year old. Hmmm.)After filling this up twice and using water for plants or tossing (per instructions) we filled it up and were ready to use. But the next day the ENTIRE filtered container's worth of water was on the bottom shelf and drawer of our fridge, and soaked 3 egg cartons and a loaf of bread. WTF? We've tried cleaning out the brand new spout (but there was nothing to clean out), fiddling with spout toggle, different water levels, setting it on different surfaces. Aside from making something that it could sit on to lean back so the water isn't touching the inside of the spout, in which case we could only filter like 2 cups at a time (and who's gonna do THAT?) we can't think of anything that would fix this. I put a 2 cup mason jar on the shelf below so water can drip through metal rack shelf but that overflowed overnight, and today has filled it 3 times, overflowed once bc I had to leave the house (all one canister full, no topping off).... So basically you're losing all your filtered water no matter what. This thing is garbage and I'm pissed that we tossed original packaging. I even thought for a moment I should save it just in case, but it was working so great for the first 2 fills.

We're a careful household so I dismissed those reviews as perhaps being due to rough usage.I recommend that you believe the reviews that mention cracks. I've owned 5 Brita pitchers over many years. The plastic being used by Brita in these pitchers is inferior to other pitchers. Cracks developed around the handle, but didn't leak. Then cracks developed around the pouring spout, again no leaks. Then cracks formed around the base of the pitcher and sure enough, those started leaking.  \"Why is the counter all wet?\"Since there are two-year old reviews on here mentioning cracks, Brita knows about this problem with this brittle plastic and has done nothing to solve it. They obviously don't care about their consumers and just keep selling the product.I'm looking for another brand. I'll seriously consider never buying Brita again. They just don't care.\n"

Instead of using a Pitcher filter and not wanting to risk my dishes, I purchased this filter - here is where the problem is.The component which physically attaches the sink to your Brita filter has the potential to whittle down and is unreliable. That is to say, if it is of poor quality then the water will erode it and will cause the Brita filter itself to be attached to the component (via the circular lock you can see on the product image) while the component dislodges from the sink partially and causes water to leak out in the dislodged area. This at first occurred very briefly, maybe once every 3 weeks. Now, it has come the point where the component itself will not even withstand even a few hours before starting to leak again, and for me the customer this means needing to either physically remove the component from the Brita filter and try to recrew it to the sink, or use another tool. All in all, buyer please be aware, these products have immensely frustrating unreliability and I am now unable to receive any of my money back that I spent on this.\n"

And when I used the two other replacement adhesive strips to reattach the fallen hook (the two hooks come with a set of four strips), again installing exactly according to instructions, after I tried to put back the light, the same hook immediately fell off two more times shortly after re-installing the light, also once taking part of the paint with it. So three of the four glue strips included in the package have failed completely and proven totally defective. The other hook has stayed on, holding the light on its own but of course improperly aligned because it is imbalanced by being supported by only one hook.This is supposed to be a brand-name adhesive strip with the 3M logo displayed, but apparently the quality control is totally abysmal. The hooks themselves are fine and sturdy, but without proper adhesion they are just so much junk plastic. And apparently you cannot simply buy replacement strips, you have to buy an entire new set of hooks. I guess I will have to buy some other producer's double sided tape to see if that works, and never consider any 3M product again. It is an inferior product for its intended purpose and would advice against purchase, not worth your money.\n"

I do remove the big ones. to save hundreds of dollars worth of crystal and glass ornaments and silks from being destroyed, I'm using actual hardware this year.

Wreath fell off the door in a couple hours.  Damaged my wreath!  I use command hooks all the time and have never had this happen before.

Let me start by first saying, I do generally like Command adhesive products, and have generally had great success using these products (in my office at work, and in a rented apartment), but this is the worst  of many packages of Command products I have purchased.First, these did not come in the 3M Command packaging - these came in a clear plastic bag, like how you get the screws and bolts for DIY furniture. I was like, okay, I've gotten other products off Amazon that didn't have the original packaging, assuming because of damage in the warehouse or something, and they worked perfectly fine. So, I kept these. BIG MISTAKE.These were the worst Command items to work with. First, is just about impossible to get the backing off these strips - I'm talking, if you are lucky enough to get a 2mm edge free with your fingernails, you need to bite with your front teeth and try to pull the rest off. Secondly, similar to what other reviewers have stated, even if you do get the backing off (sometimes a fine layer of paper remains) , the adhesive mostly peels off, then snaps back in a messy blob...it's kind like that goopy adhesive on the back of new credit cards, but way thinner, stickier, and impossible to straighten out and attempt to use. Finally, I did manage to get some usable strips out of my pack (of 16 sets, I believe) and at home hung a 10x12 frame - not heavy - to have it fall after a few weeks. And because maybe I'm a moron, I've used strips from the same package and rehung the picture only to have it eventually fall two more times. Just yesterday it fell again and the frame finally broke, which prompted me to write this review. At work, I hung a much larger, heavier dry erase calendar and it fell twice as well. I finally ended up using clear pushpins all around the bottom corners to keep it in place. The person who moves into my office after me is going to think I'm nuts.Please note, despite all the negativity, I  have purchased the same item on Amazon in the past and those hanging strips worked great - I would just be careful purchasing from this particular item option because I'm suspicious that this is a fake 3M product, or if it is, it may be a defective batch that someone chose to sell anyway. It's not like i\"m out a ton of money, it's just disappointing.\n"

I've had four pictures fall off the walls over the past year, one frame breaking and another gouging a dent in the wall on the way down. This time, it was these curtain holders that failed, which have only been up since February. I bought three holders, each of which are supposed to be able to hold five pounds. The curtain rod weighs 2.3 pounds and the curtains weigh a little less than 3 pounds together. So these three Command curtain holders should have done the job no problem. Instead, the center one came off, ripping the wall in the process.I live in an apartment and I had decided to use Command strips in order to avoid drilling holes. The result has been more damage to the walls than if I had just drilled holes. And I've used these correctly and carefully, cleaning the walls with isopropyl rubbing alcohol and letting the area dry before applying and holding them in place for one minute. I thought when the pictures started falling off the walls that it was perhaps due to extreme heat because I live in Southern California. But I had the air conditioner on while I was sleeping. It wasn't hot in here.  To say I'm angry and disappointed would about sum up how I'm feeling right now.And the people at 3M must know these are unreliable.

But you can't reliably put them back up. Sometimes, when it falls down, you try to put it back up, and then moving the LED rope causes the previous sticky to come off. So then when you tried to fix one, then you have to fix two or more! Sometimes you try to put it back up and it falls down right away, in less than one minute. I have tried holding the sticker on for over one minute. That might help some but does not always work. Sometimes, after holding the sticker there for one minute, and peeling back the blue backing and sticking the clip to, the LED rope falls down in less than one minute.You can usually tell it will fall because the sticker makes a peeling-off sound. That sound haunts me, like \"oh, no, I hear it; it's peeling off again!\" It always peels off the wall side, never the plastic clip side.For every 1 clip you put up for your LED, you will need to put up at least two clips.Often, the clip plastic will break. The clip is just big enough to fit very snugly onto the LED rope. It should probably be 1mm diameter larger. But if the clip needs to be adjusted, it will often break off. Very flimsy!Very difficult to peel off blue part after stuck to wall. Tip: Peel back blue part some, then put it back on, then peel back the wall sticker backing.

I wanted to put things back up on the wall so there were no holes when I took them down.We moved to our new house in July 2019.  I used Command Strips on almost everything that went on the wall except for the very heaviest things.  My walls have a texture but it is mostly flat so I did my best to make sure the Strips were placed where they would have a flat surface.  I also wiped down the walls with alcohol per the instructions.  3M says they are only for use on flat surfaces.  Good grief!  Where does any house have a completely flat surface other than on cabinets?Anyway, I overestimated the weight of everything and used bigger Command Strips and put a Strip on every corner of everything, except for the hooks.  In October 2020 my things began falling off the walls.  I wrote to 3M and, basically, it was my fault for using them on textured walls.  I proceeded to screw and nail up my wall decor.  However, I had a temporary, light-weight decoration to hang so I peeled a Command Strip and found it had no more adhesive whatsoever!  I pulled out a different size and it was the same thing!  I started checking them all and most of them had no more adhesive!  No wonder my things were falling!There's no expiration date on them so should they poop out like that?  I don't think so.  I wrote back to 3M saying I no longer wanted to use their product and wanted to send everything I had left to them so they could send me a refund.

Next time tried a 3-way approach using multiple options  from the package. This time it held for 2 months.

Most do not fall off on their own, but some have. In those cases, I find that the weakness is the adhesive. Not the velcro part, but the sticky adhesive part that is stuck on to objects and walls. It sticks for a good while and then at some random point decides it doesn't want to stick anymore. It's that sticky adhesive part that is the weak link in this product.

Yes, the whole day because everything has to be either thoroughly cleaned up from repairing AND the spackle & paint take time to dry.

I ended up doing MORE damage to my walls than if I had just used a single nail to hang the picture. The steps require you to put the hanging on the frame, place it on the wall and then tilt the bottom of the frame up in order to release it from the pieces stuck on the wall. Then you are supposed to put pressure on the ones on the wall and then leave them alone for an hour before putting the frames back up. On the first frame, it ripped two layers of paint and some of the drywall up. On the second, I tried to be super super careful and use a letter opener to try to separate the Velcro and it still ripped the paint and drywall up. From then on, I gave up on the instructions and just pushed the frame on the wall and left it there. Of course, with a single nail, the frame can be adjusted so it is hanging straight. With these, if you don't put it up EXACTLY perfectly the first time, oh well. You cannot easily take it off and put it back to adjust it. These are going to be an absolute nightmare when I go to take them down. The wall is going to have to be patched and painted.

When we bought the fridge, and learned it had a water filter, I thought that's nice, but had no idea that MayTag itself would not supply filters for their own products.  Instead, we're forced to search and research for someone that does sell replacement filters.  What we've learned is that this is a captured market and the manufacturers are gouging customers.  After you've spent a couple thousand on a new fridge that uses a water filter, you'll now need to spend $45+ every few months for filters, forever.  Anyhow, the morning after installing this overpriced junk, I opened the fridge and water just poured out everywhere.  It causes so much back pressure the connector and seals cannot handle it and the front shield that covers the filter fills up with water in a few minutes and then continues to flow and spill, continuously.  Lesson learned.  If you can find them, there are $18 versions of this filter that float around Amazon ever so often and they work perfectly.  A more sensibly priced and working version is at \"Compatible with Filter 2 Refrigerator Water Filter W10413645A W10413645 Kenmore 9082 (1-Pack)Sold by: apluschoice\"\n"

I pushed very hard on it, and it simply will not snap in. To make sure I was doing it right, I put the old filter back in, and that one snapped right in, no problem. The new white filter looks the same as the old blue filter with some minor differences that were pointed out by other reviewers. It looks like those minor differences are keeping this filter from working properly.I called the Whirlpool help line, and after 15 minutes on hold I finally connected to a customer support agent, who talked me through the installation procedure. It was the same procedure I was already doing, so I was not doing it incorrectly before. The filter would not snap in. He thought that it might be the wrong filter, but I have triple checked everything. I have the correct filter model for my fridge.The service agent thought that there might be something wrong with this filter since I did not buy it from Whirlpool. He told me to order one from them and it will fit. I placed the order, but I have not received it yet, so I cannot report on whether or not a filter from Whirlpool (actually, Every Drop) will fit better than the one sold by Amazon. I will update this if/when I receive the new filter and try it out.BTW, the new filter cannot be returned to Whirlpool for a refund if I open the packaging. Without opening the packaging, I will not be able to tell if the new filter will snap in to place or not. So there really is no return policy.  I am gambling my own 50 bucks on their hunch that the same filter from Whirlpool will fit while this one will not.The bottom line on this is that this filter does not fit in the Maytag MSD2559XEM refrigerator. Caveat.UPDATE:I ordered a filter directly from Whirlpool as recommended by their help line. The cost was $49.99 plus sales tax. I received the filter in about a week.The packaging of both the Whirlpool filter and the Amazon filter are identical, and the part numbers on the packaging, EDR3RXD1, are identical. The filters themselves are NOT identical. When placed side by side, you can see that on the Amazon filter, the body of the filter flares out as it goes into the end cap. On the filter from Whirlpool, the body flares out only a tiny bit, and meets the end cap mostly at a 90 degree angle. Other than that, they look identical. But that small difference seems to be key. The old blue PUR filter also does not flare out where the body goes into the end cap.The first time I tried to put the Whirlpool filter into the fridge, it did not snap in. However, I gave it one more try and replaced the old one to see exactly how much force is needed to get it to snap in. Even with the old filter, I had to give it one last nudge in order to get it to snap in, so I tried that on the Whirlpool filter, and it worked. So, the Whirlpool filter DOES fit, and the Amazon filter DOES NOT fit. I did not try to remove the new filter to see if it will come out. That would be tempting fate a bit too much.The bottom line is that there are at least two versions of this filter out there. One fits and the other does not, even though they carry the same part number. Caveat Emptor when buying third party filters.I ran water through the filter until it stopped spitting air (about two gallons). The water smells and tastes OK. I cannot detect any of the off odors or tastes that other reviewers have reported. The flow is fine. It will take a while to see how long the filter lasts.I am leaving this rating at one star because I am reviewing the filter that I bought from Amazon, not the filter that I bought from Whirlpool. They claim to be the same filter, but they are not. Because of the misrepresentation of the Amazon filter, I would remove my one star and give it a zero if I could. Caveat Emptor.\n"
