I wanted to put things back up on the wall so there were no holes when I took them down.We moved to our new house in July 2019.  I used Command Strips on almost everything that went on the wall except for the very heaviest things.  My walls have a texture but it is mostly flat so I did my best to make sure the Strips were placed where they would have a flat surface.  I also wiped down the walls with alcohol per the instructions.  3M says they are only for use on flat surfaces.  Good grief!  Where does any house have a completely flat surface other than on cabinets?Anyway, I overestimated the weight of everything and used bigger Command Strips and put a Strip on every corner of everything, except for the hooks.  In October 2020 my things began falling off the walls.  I wrote to 3M and, basically, it was my fault for using them on textured walls.  I proceeded to screw and nail up my wall decor.  However, I had a temporary, light-weight decoration to hang so I peeled a Command Strip and found it had no more adhesive whatsoever!  I pulled out a different size and it was the same thing!  I started checking them all and most of them had no more adhesive!  No wonder my things were falling!There's no expiration date on them so should they poop out like that?  I don't think so.  I wrote back to 3M saying I no longer wanted to use their product and wanted to send everything I had left to them so they could send me a refund.  They sent me a label so I'm returning everything!By the way, I kept them inside the house so they weren't exposed to sunlight or temperature extremes.",
