You simply hold onto the top, which acts as a handle, and place them into the pitcher. Similarly, you just hold onto the \"handle\" when you need to remove the filters. Previously, I would struggle to place the filters in and I needed to tip the pitcher sideways in order to replace the filters.I also think that these new filters work better than the previous filters. I've found that I have a lot less black particles in the compartment where the filter is located in the pitcher. It also no longer \"pops out\" when I tip the pitcher to pour out the last drops of water, which had been an issue with the previous filter model. In addition, the water seems to taste cleaner : )The two filters arrived packaged in a small brown box labeled 'Replacement Filters.' I was surprised that they weren't sent in the usual Brita branded packaging, however, upon opening the package I realized that this was a more efficient way to receive the product. I can also store the smaller box more easily in the kitchen drawers.\n"

          "\n  An ode to a Brita Filter:Oh Brita. With your fancy filtering. You make Chicago water drinkable. The end.I'm finicky about tap water. I can drink Philly water unfiltered, perhaps because it's what I grew up on. Some FL water is okay. Iowa City wasn't horrible. But most other Midwest cities I've lived in, I have to go with filtered or bottled. Heck, Milwaukee water actually killed a few people (69 actually). Okay, I'm not paranoid about dying....it's just that the water in some places either has a weird and/or stale taste, or a smell that's off-putting. And if I'm turned off by the city water, I tend to drink way too much juice/bottled tea/soda. So Brita is my friend. I have the big 18 cup pitcher and love it. Drain it at least once a day, with all my water drinking.These Brita filters are a bit different than ones in years past. Same great filtering, just a different design. No need to let your filter soak before using, just rinse it under the tap. And removing it it is a thousand times easier with it's easy-grip top. The contents are (as far as I know), exactly the same, providing you with clean tasting, clean smelling, fresh water.\n"

It looks like a +, as though you could line it up either way, but it won't work.  Just take your time, try each alignment, and you'll hit the right one and the filter will seat perfectly.\n"

          "\n  These are good filters, as long as you understand the tradeoffs between these and Brita's other filters. Brita did succeed in getting water to flow through faster, but it's by no means free-flowing, and it doesn't remove as much as their traditional filters. But it probably does a good enough job that most people will still be happy.First, the flow rate. I'd call it a heavy trickle. It doesn't hold a candle to pouring from a regular pitcher, or the flow from a sink, but it's not bad. I'd say it's about on par with a refrigerator's in-door water dispenser, to give you an idea. It does get significantly slower as the pitcher is getting closer to empty, but that's not a huge deal since you can refill it instantly. I've also noticed the flow rate varies a lot from filter to filter, for what it's worth.As for the filtering performance, it's worth noting that this filters out chlorine, and not really anything else. Does that matter? Probably not. Chlorine is probably responsible for most of the unpleasant taste in municipal water. If that's all you care about, then this will probably do the job (although the traditional filters seem to work slightly better in my experience). If, however, you happen to be in an older building, you might be concerned about other contaminants, like lead or mercury. In that case, this filter won't help you. (What you probably want is Brita's Longlast filter, their only filter that removes lead.)So, are these worth it? Well, if you are chronically forgetful about refilling the pitcher until you're thirsty (or if you have lazy roommates), probably. Unless you live in a building with ancient pipes: then you still might want to pass.\n"

I use my Brita for drinking water all day long for two adults. We go through a minimum of two gallons of water a day.

I originally bought the turquoise one for my mom and we all liked it so much (it really improved the taste of her water) that I bought the red one for our home to try and get us off purchasing sparkling water. The included basic filter fit perfectly (just have to line it up with the notch on the pitcher) after I followed the directions to rinse it under cold running water for fifteen seconds. I could see the carbon dust being washed away in about three seconds. The water tastes great and the pitcher is a good size for one or two people to use on a daily basis. The filter counter obviously doesn't really know how much water has gone through it if you open the lid to refill before the pitcher is emptied. I plan on using my calender as a guide since I know how much water we use on a typical day. I also figure if the water tastes \"off\" it will be time to change the filter. You take the entire lid off to refill, but it comes off and snaps back on easily. The water filters through quickly, but it will take a couple minutes and you will need to fill it up in two batches as you wait for it to filter. The red color goes with our kitchen so I was happy it cost the same as the plain white one after paying an extra $4 for the turquoise one for mom. We're all very happy with both of them.

I don't want to contaminate the water -- I think the indicator reminding one to change filters is useless and just a gimmick to counter Purr but the indicator on Purr I believe is most accurate.  It's based on the amount if time the canister is tilted to pour.  I had a larger capacity Purr and it was normally accurate based on the the amount of times it was tilted to pour.  I am a heavy user of my Briter (as was I on the Purr) I use the water in my tea pot, to drink or make lemonade.  Overall Brita does taste better, doesn't take forever to filterate into pitcher and it's smaller easier to store and to handle.  The purr was heavier, longer much longer time to filterate, bulky (taking up to much space in fridge) and a ritual to put in a new filter.  So for a great taste of water, less fuss an ease to change filters.  My only quirk is the indicator.  But I know when the water begans to taste like chlorine.\n"

This is a nice size and it takes the original filters I had from other Brita pitchers I bought in the past. I like the indicator on the handle that tells you when to replace the filter because I'm terrible about writing these things down on a calendar. I love the red color especially because it adds a pop of color inside my stainless steel refrigerator. We have very hard water and I think the city uses a lot of lime in processing the water, so filtering the water to drink it a must. I am so happy to find a pitcher that doesn't break my arm trying to get it from the fridge to the counter. And all my Brita pitchers have lasted forever, well made product that does what it's supposed to do.

I stopped using my tap water for drinking (including coffee and tea) and some recipes such as fermenting foods. I use distilled water but it's always a bugger when I run out.

If you dropped this I feel confident it would break. That's something to be aware of. It's not as strong as I assumed it would be. If you add too much pressure you can hear the strain of the plastic. Although for $30, I still feel like I got a great deal. The filtering process is very, very slow. I timed how long it takes to filter it and fill it up and it was about 25 minutes. So beware, if you're looking for something quickly filtered and refillable, you might be disappointed. However, I think it's easy to walk away and come back to see it filled. The nozzle pours the water out quickly though. It's just the filtering that is slow while you refill the container. It's fully worth it though and worth every penny. I am satisfied with my purchase.

The way I removed it was by tucking the pitcher under my left arm, and with my right thumb and forefinger, I gripped the little recess in the reservoir and wiggled it back and forth while pulling outwards. If the assembly is dry, it will come out just fine. If it's wet, it'll take a little more effort.For people complaining about the filter, I grant that you may have had a lemon, but from what I can tell, most of the issues experienced will be avoided by FLUSHING THE FILTER WITH WATER BEFORE USE, and DISPOSING OF THE FIRST FEW PITCHERS OF FILTERED WATER, as instructed.Follow the instructions, keep it refrigerated, clean it periodically, replace your filters when your water stops tasting filtered, and you are unlikely to have problems.

As for not filtering the water, let me say my sink is underneath a window looking out at my pool.  I very often fill a glass with water and hold it up to the sunlight and the water is crystal clear with nothing floating around in it.  To make the filter work and light to work you have to let it run for 5 minute to blow out debris caused in the manufacturing.  Another problem for no light is probably low water pressure.

New has the lid moulded  as part of the reservior [both old/new have flap in lid you lift to fill reservior with water]3) Physically smaller & lighter so fits in fridge easier [sorry, forgot the exact measurements of old but empty was ~20% heavier]With old pitcher, due to 1) [slow pour] then tended to tilt pitcher to a steep angle to try to speed it up,resulting in 2) happening even more!The old had one advantage - it has larger capacity [new allows easier overfill to partly mitigate]Compared to some of the other current Brita pitchers, I like that this has a cover over thespout [to prevent debris getting in] and the curved sides look nicer than my old boxy 10 cupperFilterI switched to the blue Brita Longlife filters - unlike the Standard white filters, these claim to filter Lead/Benzene/Asbestosfor the same running cost [they are 3 times as expensive but last 3 times longer].

It also pours with a clean stream of water that makes it easy to fill things and that stream doesn't fall apart as it did on both of my previous pitchers, including the Grand. Finally, there were reviews which warned that the water ran through quickly and so they assumed it wasn't filtering well. I suspect that those users did not line up the notches. When inserting the filter, you have to be careful to line it up correctly, then push it in snugly. Of course, if it's not in all the way and doesn't seal, then yes - it won't work well, but it's easy to do it correctly if you're aware. I recommend this pitcher without reservation!

One of my friends had this dispenser and I liked the idea that it would hold more than my pitcher, but because it's taller and thinner, it actually takes up less room in my fridge. I've had it for a week and I'm very happy with my purchase.One word of caution, if you put it near the edge so that the spigot is hanging over a shelf, making it possible to hold your glass underneath, be sure that when you close your fridge door, that nothing, such as a door shelf is hitting the spigot. I thought it only worked if you pulled the spigot down, but it also works if you push it back. About 30 minutes after I filed it and put it in my fridge, I came into the kitchen to find water all over my floor and the dispenser was empty. I have a french door fridge which has shorter doors, but deeper door shelves. When I closed the door, I wasn't aware that one of the door shelves was pushing against the spigot, causing the water to come out. It was easily fixed by adjusting the shelf and it was definitely not a fault of the product, but hopefully I can spare someone else from making the same mistake.\n"

I actually replaced my Stream with this as the Stream only seems to filter chlorine.  The longlast filter that came with this pitcher produces as much cleaner tasting water, as do the original white filters.This pitcher does have a wide pour spout with no restriction, but I've had no issue in filling even ice trays.  It just angle it to pour out of one of the corners of the spout.  I do also hold it with one hand, with the other hand on the front of the pitcher, thumb on the lid to keep it secure.  This is especially helpful if there's water in the top filter reservoir.My only con is that it doesn't have an indicating lid like most other models to.  They do supply a sticker for the top with a moveable indicator to remind you when yo change, but I would have preferred the lighted reminder.  I'm not sure why they skipped it on this model given that it's priced the same as the Monterey.

The filtered water works for my coffee as well as with my fish (with conditioner, of course.)Note: having read some of the low ratings. It would be obvious that one does not tip the pitcher past the pouring point (like, bottoms up). So of course, the filter will fall out! It use to fall out even with the old style!\n"

It measures the time between pushing the reset button approximately  every two months.  We process a lot of water, more than the average family, so we measure by gallons approximately 40 gallons per filter, instead of days.  The quantity of water, this pitcher holds works out better than my last smaller filter, and the filter part does not fall back into our water.

Most of the brooms, hairdryers, bags, towels are all under 3 lbs (which surprised me). 2. The metal tip of the hook is narrow enough to fit most things (including hot water bottles). 3. The (mostly) straight shape of the hook allows the handles of all of my brooms to go on and off easily, without me having to tip the broom to lift it off a hook. 4. The size-large hooks are longer, which means, to take off the top part of the hook assembly (or to remove the hook), there must be at least \u00bd\" of space above the hook assembly. In certain spaces (like in my closets), the bigger hooks simply can't fit.\n"

Pretty simple.  I went to the local store to check out the selection of command hooks and see which would be best to hang my particular grill tools.  Each command hook has a different shaped and sized tip, and I found the medium wire hooks to be the most adequate for my grill tools.  Problem is, all command hooks come in white and they can stand out like sore thumb against a different color wall/product.  I decided to try and paint the command hooks to match and it worked perfectly.  I simply taped off the metal hook part and sprayed the plastic with two coats of black spray paint.  The paint applied evenly and has stayed on well without any chipping over 3 months outdoors (under a grill cover) and have had no issues peeling off due to the heat.These were great and a very simple solution to hanging grill tools at a total cost of about $5.  Similar char broil branded grill hooks run $15-$20.  Check out the pictures to see how they turned out.\n"

Be sure you get any dust, dirt, oils, or grease off the wall or, just like tape, they will stick to the adhesive strip and make it less sticky and more likely to come off the wall.When I first tried to hang my spice rack, it fell down within a minute of installation and adding the spices.  When I felt the adhesive, I found spots that seemed less sticky and seamed to have dust on them.  I used straight isopropyl alcohol on my granite back splash to clean it before hanging my spice rack again and this time, they have been up for 2 months without falling!  I did the same thing on my travertine tile inside my shower and use the hooks to hang our Loofas...2 months, even in the shower that sees daily use by two people, in a place that gets wet every time the shower is turned on, they are holding firm!On my walls that had any texture what-so-ever though...they fall right off within hours no matter how light or heavy the load.

My biggest use so far has been in the RV.  We own a 5th wheel and I use these for mounting clocks and weather gauges on the wall along with lamps, computer printers, alarm clocks and coffee makers on the counters and table tops.

As good as all the Command products are, I find myself using these the most, in the RV and around the house.

Adhesive wasn't a problem just the \"velcro\" started separating from the weight.  A third strip along the top of the rack has done the trick.  Quite a heavy load but is working quite well so far.  I also attached a USB hub and a USB card reader to the outside of my oak veneered computer desk.  These get quite a lot of use and this is just perfect for not causing damage when removed but have significant strength.\n"

I originally used two white medium sized hooks, which were highly visible.  I purchased a two pack of medium black hooks (I almost chose the bronze, which probably would have matched better given the metallic finish, but the price difference between the black and bronze was rather extraordinary, so I thought I'd try the black ones first).I thought the black hooks would be ideal because the wire frame is a dark color.  I was able to easily remove just the white plastic hook part from the adhesive which was already in place where it needed to be, and swapped out the white hooks with the black hooks without any hassle whatsoever. Sure enough, the black hooks are nearly invisible, and the wall hanging, which actually weighs closer to 8 lbs., looks terrific where it is, adhered to a piece of expensive furniture.Just be sure to follow the instructions and do not hang anything up immediately after adhering the hook to the surface.

You'll have to get a pretty thin rod for it to sit securely inside of the hook area - the one I purchased was from IKEA and it works great. I wish they made these jumbo hooks in a style that didn't look so... warehouse-y... but honestly I'm so grateful for them that I'll take what I can get.Excellent stick quality, reliable, and have/will buy again.EDITED TO ADD:I wanted to add a little more info on the type of rods that will work with these hooks. In my bedroom I use the IKEA R\u00c4CKA Curtain rod, which is 3/4\" diameter. It sits easily inside of the Command hooks. I used this solution in my living room as well (see second attached photo - don't judge as I'm in the middle of redecorating, ha!) but because this rod was much longer, I used 3 hooks to hold it up. For my living room, I used Threshold\u2122 Industrial Cage Curtain Rod from Target. It is listed as 1\" diameter and fits in the hook, though it does sit a little higher in the hook.Something super important to note is that not many finials will work with these hooks since they sit so closely to the wall. I was disappointed that the pretty globe finials that came with my Target rod set wouldn't work - they were just too big. The finials I got from IKEA did work, however - they were much smaller and lay flat/flush with the wall.Edit 2/24/17: I attached a new picture - months later these are still holding strong with no issues. :)\n"

And, yes, I have used those plastic things that are supposed to hold screws in drywall.  Anyway, I was getting hooks for something else and saw reviews recommending them for curtain rods... GENIUS!!!!! I only needed two for the ends and that curtain rod is not budging, even in the center of the window where there is now no support.  It is close to the wall but there is still plenty of room to open and close the curtain.  Whoever first thought of doing this, THANK YOU!\n"

It also easily peels off when you want to remove it, in cases where you are renting a house or moving, or just moving things around. As you can see in the photograph it can hold fairly large object and has a big enough hook for hanging pretty much everything you want. It says the capacity is around 7lbs, but it feels like you can go much higher. The knife collection I have hanging up is probably around that, and it shows no signs of struggling. You can probably hang havier objects like potted plants or bigger decorations without any issue. Any money spent on this pays for itself because it means there will be no holes on walls, paint damage from tape, or other issues which will cost you much more in the long run.\n"

These have a more curved design so I do not think that it will break down like the others. These hooks say they will hold up to 5 pounds which is similar to the others I had. I got four of them. One I use to hang my bathrobe on the back of the door and the others are used to hang up wet towels.These look great! They match the brushed nickel finish on the door hardware in our rooms so they are great. You can feel that they are plastic before you put it up, but once they are up, no one would ever know that they are not more expensive metal hooks.The hooks are great for my bathrobe, towels or to hang up a pair of jeans, or anything really. My bathrobe is thick cotton and can be pretty heavy when wet. I have not had any of these come loose. I will be buying more to replace other hooks I have in the house. A great find and price!From top to bottom the whole thing is about 4\" long. Perfect for the back of a door or any number of places.If you have never used command strip hooks they hold amazingly well, and to remove you just pull down on the adhesive strip that hangs down. When you install them there are too parts. The hanger with the adhesive strip that you apply to the wall, and then once you apply it and hold it in place for 30 seconds the actual hook part that you see slides on it securely. To remove you just slide up to remove and then pull the adhesive tab straight down slowly until it removes the whole thing, with no residue left.The hook comes with an extra adhesive strip in case you decide to paint and need to put it back up, or if you relocate the strip.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks\n"

These are a really nice alternative to nails for larger items and are sturdier than 3M's Sawtooth Picture-Hanging Hooks, which are best to use with smaller items with sawtooth hangers.As with any 3M hooks, you need to follow the prep directions and clean any surface with rubbing alcohol (not household cleaners) ahead of time then wait at least an hour before you hang anything on them. Additionally, I'd advise waiting at least a month to mount any of these on freshly painted walls; I made the mistake of trying to use them on walls I had just painted earlier this fall, and they pulled down even after I prepped them properly.

I really didn't want to resort to drilling and putting a screw in the door.  I took the chance and ordered one of these Jumbo Command Hooks.  It was really cheap and became an add-on item to the rest of my order.Installation was super easy.  You basically prep the area you want to stick the hook to with rubbing alcohol.  The instructions do advise you not to use any other household cleaning products to do that.  Next, you remove the red adhesive on the back of the stickers and place them on the hook.  Then remove the black stickers and place the hook on your desired location.  Of course, there's a few seconds and minutes of pressing into place for all procedures that are involved.  You also need to allow the hook to rest in place for about an hour before hanging anything on it.My bathrobe weights 5lbs.  This hook is rated for 7.5 lbs.  I am now going on day two of having this hook support my robe and it's doing an admirable job.What I really like about this hook is if I no longer need it, it easily removes without any adhesive residue -- at least, that is what the manufacturer is claiming.This product does come with an extra set of adhesives in case you make a mistake and need to start over.Count me in as someone who is very impressed with this product.

I have a couple that are painted chrome to match the 7\"-blade chrome fan that's hanging on them.The classic bronze-painted hooks are on my bathroom travertine walls. They serve as towel hooks. The adhesive hasn't failed yet (going on 6 years now). What usually fails is the plastic itself - i.e., the \"hook\" part breaks off after a few years. That's probably from people tugging down their towels. The hooks can hold 7.5 lbs but not when people keep tugging down on their towels.I have one hook (actually, the wall back part only, not the outside hook part) holding up a 21\" x 21\" wall frame that's ~5 lbs. The frame has a horizontal length of braided wire at the back that you're supposed to hang on a nail/hook. I didn't want to drill a hole in my travertine tiles so I just used the wall/back part of this 17004 hook to hang the frame.\n"

Humidity doesn't seem to negatively impact the hangers -- I was without AC for about three days when the temp was in the 90s; although my home got super humid/hot, it didn't cause these Command hangers to lose their grip on the wall.  Installation, as with any Command product, was super easy.  It was a little tricky balancing the level across the two hangers because of the shape on top, but other than that, no problems at all.Tip:  Make sure that you follow the directions in order to get the best performance from this type of hanger -- you really do need to let it set on the wall for at least 30 minutes before hanging the canvas on it.  I've learned in the past that if you don't do it that way, the Command hanger doesn't get a solid enough grip and can fall off the wall within a few months.  If you follow the directions, these types of hangers will stay up for years -- and when you do remove them, they don't peel paint.

We have a picture on the wall next to a door, and when we hung it from a nail we found that closing and opening the door over time always made it tilt to the side.  With these hanging strips, it stays right in place.2) You know when you hang pictures from two nails (one on each side) and you just can't QUITE get both sides even?  Not a problem with this, since it works kind of like velcro you can just get the pieces stuck on \"close enough\" and then adjust a little with no problem.Hanging pictures with these things is a breeze, and if you live in an apartment / dorm where you can't put holes in the wall, they are definitely worth it.

One each keeps the humidifiers' cords from falling to the floor when their bases need cleaning, and ditto for the USB cords when they're not recharging the afore-mentioned lights.

We first discovered these when I noticed how straight the picture frames were in my sister-in-law's gallery wall. They hung all of the frames with Command picture hanging strips. Our crooked frames were already hung with nails, so we used Command Stabilizer Strips to keep them straight - they work great!Once the stabilizer strips were taken care of, there were some other items to hang on our walls. We used the Picture Hanging Strips to hang wooden letters, a foamcore posterboard, and 11x14 canvases.The canvases are not the kind with a wood frame on the back, but the canvas is wrapped around something thin. They are maybe 3/8\" thick. My son has painted several of these at painting parties. It would probably be best to use two strips with them, in the top two corners, but we just used one in the center near the top. They are fairly lightweight and so far it has been fine.The reason we just used one in the center was because we wanted to hang then on our kids' doors part of the time, but we already had a Command hook there for holiday decorations. I ended up removing the hooks and putting a Picture-hanging strip on the back of the Command hook like it would go on the back of a picture. Then a Picture-hanging strip on the door. Now we can hang our Command hook on the door for lightweight holiday decorations (things like a Christmas stocking or felt jack-o-lantern). Or we can remove the hook and put my son's paintings up. It's great to have the versatility. We did have to trim the picture-hanging strip a bit to fit on the back of the hook, but that of course would depend on the size strip and hook you used. I also wouldn't stress the hook too much so we've only used lightweight decorations.As far as using them the normal way, we have been pleased with them. If you don't get it quite straight, remove the picture and try again. We used a small level on top of our frames before pressing the strips together.We had recently repainted our doors, so we made sure to wait a week before applying the strips.

These are terrific, and perform exactly as expected.Be careful when you buy them: the engineers at 3M have done a good job of designing them to hold specific amounts of weight, and mark them accordingly. If you are hanging a heavy 5-lb. picture mirror, for example, then you need to ensure that you read the fine print and not just buy the first item that shows up after you type \"3M Command\" as a search string. I've even weighed items using our kitchen scale to make sure I matched our to-be-hung items to the appropriate hook.As promised, they remove easily from household painted surfaces in our kitchen, bathroom, and living spaces.  We removed ours from enamel-based as well as latex-based paints.One last thing: these come in a variety of styles and finishes, too--so it's worth the extra time to search, read the fine print, and get the right one.\n"

I marked the location with a pencil, then placed the strips on the caddy and stuck the caddy on the cabinet door.  I resisted the urge to fill them immediately; I actually let them stay in place overnight before filling them.  These were a great problem-solver for me.

I plan on ordering more as I work my way through the house.  I've repeated this review for the medium and the large; other than the size they're identical products.  I would recommend measuring your cabinets carefully (not just the doors, but the inside frame of the cabinets and the location of the shelves to make sure it will fit).

They don't hold a ton of weight (half a pound each), but I used all 9 of them to create the perfect scarf holder.My walls are heavily textured so I was concerned that they wouldn't hold as well as a smooth wall, but after following the directions to the T, they are holding rather well. You really must be sure to put all your weight into it while holding it on there for the 30 seconds during application. I think this made all the difference. So far, so good! Just make sure when your putting the strips on the back that you are holding the hanger straight as the metal hooks can flop over and trick you if you aren't paying attention.\n"

These hooks held up all year for this purpose!! I also have one hanging at knee level behind the door of the classroom to hold the dustpan and it is used several times a day by the students as well. This hook held up all year too. I was leery of using these as they are expensive and of course, as a teacher, I have to buy my own for use in my classroom. These work so well on the painted brick walls that will continue to use them with confidence that things I hang will stay put. I'm too busy to have to keep rehanging items and certainly can't replace items that fall and break when a hook doesn't work. I will not buy generic ones again. Command Hooks just worked better.\n"

I followed directions for the latter, waited as instructed, and surprisingly none have ever fallen where you would expect\u2014in the shower\u2014when it's dry and esp when it's in use, and w/plenty of steam from hot water where the water doesn't actually hit.Some hooks on the side and the shower's other end are held on w/standard strips\u2014not water-resistant strips\u2014and nothing has ever budged, much less fallen. NOTE: I often will choose a hook or strip in excess of the weight of the object I'm hanging, choosing it not so much for its weight-limit but for its look or shape in the spot where I'm placing it. The actual hook of some all-plastic hooks may be too thick, so I'll use a wire hook in that spot.I also have hooks holding motion-detecting lights in coat, linen, and bedroom closets.

It's a very very heavy coat so I doubted it would hold it, but I cannot believe how steering this adhesive is.I have a Cabela's winter parka with a removable interior fleece jacket and hood. It's waterproof and I keep gloves, winter hats, and multiple gadgets and tools in the pockets so it can weigh up to 20 pounds or more at times, especially if it's wet. It didn't affect the adhesion to the wall and I worried more about the paint than I did the hook after using it a couple times.These are so much more reliable and strong than I could've ever imagined and I will be purchasing more of these products for different applications all over the house.Worth the very low price I paid.\n"

Wanted hooks on the back of our closet and bathroom doors to hang our robes, but didn't want to damage the doors with screws as we will be selling in the near future.  These hooks are the perfect size for this.  Just clean the area with rubbing alcohol, let it dry, then peel and stick!  That simple!  Also simple to remove, just pull out on the bottom end of the hook and slide upward, then pull on the sticky tab.  I painted one antique gold to match the brass in our bathroom and it turned out very nice.  So far they seem very durable and have stuck well, only time will tell?  Very happy with purchase!  Would definitely buy again.\n"

Since shopping on Amazon, I have discovered the 3M Command Hooks and it has changed my life. I have used all types of the hooks for various reasons. There is a hook to fulfill every kind of household need. I have attached a few pics for reference.The hooks adhesion and suction are impeccable, yet, it is so easy to remove. These hooks hold very strongly.  No heating is necessary from a blow dryer. Just make sure you pull the strip downwards and not toward you. The wall is left seamless.I have since purchased the Command Shelf which is also another great choice for storage without damaging my walls.\n"

They were ideal for mounting the 3 long under-cabinet lights above the kitchen counter, and the most-recent use was installing small shelves for the gnomes to sit on above the living room curtains. Adhesive pads were provided to hang the latter but one look at the damaged wall when a user tried to remove the shelf hung w/them was all it took to find another method.As for pictures themselves, though, they aren't ideal unless you're very precise w/your measurements. Once you press the picture frame or whatever you're hanging against them and the strips lock into place there's no straightening or adjusting it 'just a tad' w/o a lot of bother.Note, though, that the strips do tend to dry out over time and for that reason removing them isn't always as easy as 3M would have you believe. So if you find it necessary to remove any of them pull down VERY SLOWLY and you should have no problem.\n"

May not adhere to well to vinyl surfaces.DO NOT use for antiques, heirlooms, or other valuable or irreplaceable items.DO NOT hang items over beds.That really says it all, doesn't it? Don't hang anything of value and don't hang it in a place that will hurt if it falls on your head.These are easy to install and work great for collage-type projects, as you have the ability to place photos in an exact location. We have used them for things like smoke detectors, canvas art and smaller pictures. So far, they have worked well. It is very important that you follow the installation instructions. Be patient; make sure you wait the allotted 30 minutes before hanging your items. I usually wait longer, just to be on the safe side. The hanging strips come off cleanly and easily.Keep in mind when you are ordering these, the recommended usage for picture sizes are as follows:Small Strips:  1 set for a 3x5, 2 sets for a 5 x 7 and 4 sets for an 8 x 10.Medium Strips: 1 set for an 8 x 10, 2 sets for an 11 x 17 and 4 sets for an 18 x 20.I, personally, have never hung anything with only 1 strip; I've always used at least two.This package has 4 sets of small strips and 8 sets of medium strips.

I had tried another brand of adhesive hook that I had replaced twice because they let go. In doing so, they left a yucky, sticky mess of stuck on adhesive.So I decided to find another alternative and found the Command hooks. In this case, I used the medium hooks because they are supposed to hold 3 pounds and the cover I wanted to hang were just under 3 pounds. I cleaned off the adhesive left by the other hooks, cleaned the area with alcohol as recommended, and left the Command hook on the door for an hour as recommended. So far it has been a couple of weeks and the hooks are holding. I couldn't be happier, and would highly recommend these hooks. I also suggest that any area you use the Command hooks is clean and smooth. This will help them to stick more permanently. I also love that these can be easily removed when you no longer need them.UPDATE 3/30/18:The hook that I originally installed on the back of a cabinet door to hold my silicone casserole covers in April of 2016 is still holding strong two years later.\n"

Until I got command hooks, that is. Make sure you follow the directions and clean the surface with some alcohol and let it dry completely. Also with holding it on to set and not hanging anything on it before the prescribed time. I have used both of these hooks in my classroom. One holds my jacket, the other my purse. I love them and definitely recommend using them. I did break one, hanging more than the prescribed amount on it. Although the hook itself broke, the base remained hanging, stuck tight to the wall. I love that about it! The adhesive was as easy to remove as they show in the commercials. It is amazing. So this purchase was actually to replace the last one I had broke, and that's when I decided I needed 2 hooks and not just one :)\n"

This one is good for smaller items like re-usable grocery bags or jackets. There's a Jumbo version that I prefer that's truly amazing. I've hung my backpack with a full water bottle, laptop, and wallet on it and never had an issue. I've never had one leave a mark on my walls or remove paint, but on a door with a very dark wood finish/stain, they did take off a bit off the finish when removed. This didn't surprise me, because the finish was coming off on cleaning rags and stuff when I was dusting and cleaning. But still, use caution with dark wood surfaces.This size hook is great for hanging washcloths, dishcloths and towels (rather than throwing them over the edge of the faucet or sink, or hanging off the oven handle... which is what we did before). I've also used them to hang jewelry on the inside of my closet door.Make sure you follow the directions. The surface should be clean and dry. They recommend that you clean it with alcohol first, which can strip off some of the paint or finish, so be careful and gentle when you do that. The first time I did it, I really rubbed with the alcohol, which removed some of the paint from my wall.\n"

I participate in a lot of conference calls for my job so I use a headset. I got a large for that, not due to the weight but the size of the hook.  the small hooks were prettier but I got the medium because it had a larger hook that looked easier to hang the headset on and quickly take it off.

If you are applying it to regular interior latex painted drywall, try this technique:1) Wash your hands with soap and water.2) Clean the wall area of any debris, and wipe with 91% rubbing alcohol. If you have heavy texturing, try to make it flat first.3) Clean the plastic wall clip part of the hook where the adhesion pad goes. Keep the two parts of the hook together. Do not put oily fingerprints on the back.4) Apply the hook-side adhesion layer to the hook, aligning the tab to point down toward the floor. Be careful to line it up to take up the full pad area with the adhesive strip.5) Apply the hook to the wall, carefully lining up the hooks exactly as you'd like.6) Carefully remove the hook from the wall clip (pull gently up from the hook side). This will expose the plastic wall clip that sticks to the wall.7) Press FIRMLY on the clip, against the wall, for 20-30 seconds. Try to remove any air bubbles.Doing this will give you a very strong bond to the wall. To remove, take off the hook part (pull up), then pull down on the tab slowly. The pad will come right off the wall.One note, be very careful when removing the hook from the wall clip. I pushed a little too hard and cut my finger from the sharp plastic on the wall clip. I don't think that's a product flaw at all. That was all me being clumsy. Just be careful.\n"

Most of the brooms, hairdryers, bags, towels are all under 3 lbs (which surprised me). 2. The metal tip of the hook is narrow enough to fit most things (including hot water bottles). 3. The (mostly) straight shape of the hook allows the handles of all of my brooms to go on and off easily, without me having to tip the broom to lift it off a hook. 4. The size-large hooks are longer, which means, to take off the top part of the hook assembly (or to remove the hook), there must be at least \u00bd\" of space above the hook assembly. In certain spaces (like in my closets), the bigger hooks simply can't fit.\n"

Pretty simple.  I went to the local store to check out the selection of command hooks and see which would be best to hang my particular grill tools.  Each command hook has a different shaped and sized tip, and I found the medium wire hooks to be the most adequate for my grill tools.  Problem is, all command hooks come in white and they can stand out like sore thumb against a different color wall/product.  I decided to try and paint the command hooks to match and it worked perfectly.  I simply taped off the metal hook part and sprayed the plastic with two coats of black spray paint.  The paint applied evenly and has stayed on well without any chipping over 3 months outdoors (under a grill cover) and have had no issues peeling off due to the heat.These were great and a very simple solution to hanging grill tools at a total cost of about $5.  Similar char broil branded grill hooks run $15-$20.  Check out the pictures to see how they turned out.\n"

Be sure you get any dust, dirt, oils, or grease off the wall or, just like tape, they will stick to the adhesive strip and make it less sticky and more likely to come off the wall.When I first tried to hang my spice rack, it fell down within a minute of installation and adding the spices.

I used straight isopropyl alcohol on my granite back splash to clean it before hanging my spice rack again and this time, they have been up for 2 months without falling!  I did the same thing on my travertine tile inside my shower and use the hooks to hang our Loofas...2 months, even in the shower that sees daily use by two people, in a place that gets wet every time the shower is turned on, they are holding firm!On my walls that had any texture what-so-ever though...they fall right off within hours no matter how light or heavy the load.

My biggest use so far has been in the RV.

As good as all the Command products are, I find myself using these the most, in the RV and around the house.

Pretty strong stuff.  I had to add another one a few minutes ago to my rack that I made for my very heavy mod box battery boxes that have two 18650 cells each (3 battery boxes x 2 batteries each) plus 3 other smaller batteries on the rack was just too much weight for two of the \"velcro\" fasteners.

I also didn't want the hooks to be obvious since the sculpture's wire frame from which it hangs can be readily seen from multiple angles in the room.  I originally used two white medium sized hooks, which were highly visible.  I purchased a two pack of medium black hooks (I almost chose the bronze, which probably would have matched better given the metallic finish, but the price difference between the black and bronze was rather extraordinary, so I thought I'd try the black ones first).I thought the black hooks would be ideal because the wire frame is a dark color.  I was able to easily remove just the white plastic hook part from the adhesive which was already in place where it needed to be, and swapped out the white hooks with the black hooks without any hassle whatsoever. Sure enough, the black hooks are nearly invisible, and the wall hanging, which actually weighs closer to 8 lbs., looks terrific where it is, adhered to a piece of expensive furniture.Just be sure to follow the instructions and do not hang anything up immediately after adhering the hook to the surface.

You'll have to get a pretty thin rod for it to sit securely inside of the hook area - the one I purchased was from IKEA and it works great.

In my bedroom I use the IKEA R\u00c4CKA Curtain rod, which is 3/4\" diameter. It sits easily inside of the Command hooks. I used this solution in my living room as well (see second attached photo - don't judge as I'm in the middle of redecorating, ha!) but because this rod was much longer, I used 3 hooks to hold it up. For my living room, I used Threshold\u2122 Industrial Cage Curtain Rod from Target. It is listed as 1\" diameter and fits in the hook, though it does sit a little higher in the hook.Something super important to note is that not many finials will work with these hooks since they sit so closely to the wall. I was disappointed that the pretty globe finials that came with my Target rod set wouldn't work - they were just too big. The finials I got from IKEA did work, however - they were much smaller and lay flat/flush with the wall.Edit 2/24/17: I attached a new picture - months later these are still holding strong with no issues. :)\n"

As you can see in the photograph it can hold fairly large object and has a big enough hook for hanging pretty much everything you want. It says the capacity is around 7lbs, but it feels like you can go much higher. The knife collection I have hanging up is probably around that, and it shows no signs of struggling. You can probably hang havier objects like potted plants or bigger decorations without any issue. Any money spent on this pays for itself because it means there will be no holes on walls, paint damage from tape, or other issues which will cost you much more in the long run.\n"

These have a more curved design so I do not think that it will break down like the others. These hooks say they will hold up to 5 pounds which is similar to the others I had. I got four of them. One I use to hang my bathrobe on the back of the door and the others are used to hang up wet towels.These look great! They match the brushed nickel finish on the door hardware in our rooms so they are great. You can feel that they are plastic before you put it up, but once they are up, no one would ever know that they are not more expensive metal hooks.The hooks are great for my bathrobe, towels or to hang up a pair of jeans, or anything really. My bathrobe is thick cotton and can be pretty heavy when wet. I have not had any of these come loose. I will be buying more to replace other hooks I have in the house. A great find and price!From top to bottom the whole thing is about 4\" long. Perfect for the back of a door or any number of places.If you have never used command strip hooks they hold amazingly well, and to remove you just pull down on the adhesive strip that hangs down. When you install them there are too parts. The hanger with the adhesive strip that you apply to the wall, and then once you apply it and hold it in place for 30 seconds the actual hook part that you see slides on it securely. To remove you just slide up to remove and then pull the adhesive tab straight down slowly until it removes the whole thing, with no residue left.The hook comes with an extra adhesive strip in case you decide to paint and need to put it back up, or if you relocate the strip.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks\n"

These are a really nice alternative to nails for larger items and are sturdier than 3M's Sawtooth Picture-Hanging Hooks, which are best to use with smaller items with sawtooth hangers.As with any 3M hooks, you need to follow the prep directions and clean any surface with rubbing alcohol (not household cleaners) ahead of time then wait at least an hour before you hang anything on them. Additionally, I'd advise waiting at least a month to mount any of these on freshly painted walls; I made the mistake of trying to use them on walls I had just painted earlier this fall, and they pulled down even after I prepped them properly.

I really didn't want to resort to drilling and putting a screw in the door.  I took the chance and ordered one of these Jumbo Command Hooks.  It was really cheap and became an add-on item to the rest of my order.Installation was super easy.  You basically prep the area you want to stick the hook to with rubbing alcohol.  The instructions do advise you not to use any other household cleaning products to do that.  Next, you remove the red adhesive on the back of the stickers and place them on the hook.  Then remove the black stickers and place the hook on your desired location.  Of course, there's a few seconds and minutes of pressing into place for all procedures that are involved.  You also need to allow the hook to rest in place for about an hour before hanging anything on it.My bathrobe weights 5lbs.  This hook is rated for 7.5 lbs.  I am now going on day two of having this hook support my robe and it's doing an admirable job.What I really like about this hook is if I no longer need it, it easily removes without any adhesive residue -- at least, that is what the manufacturer is claiming.This product does come with an extra set of adhesives in case you make a mistake and need to start over.Count me in as someone who is very impressed with this product.  It really does seem strong enough to support its advertised weight capacity.

Humidity doesn't seem to negatively impact the hangers -- I was without AC for about three days when the temp was in the 90s; although my home got super humid/hot, it didn't cause these Command hangers to lose their grip on the wall.  Installation, as with any Command product, was super easy.  It was a little tricky balancing the level across the two hangers because of the shape on top, but other than that, no problems at all.Tip:  Make sure that you follow the directions in order to get the best performance from this type of hanger -- you really do need to let it set on the wall for at least 30 minutes before hanging the canvas on it.  I've learned in the past that if you don't do it that way, the Command hanger doesn't get a solid enough grip and can fall off the wall within a few months.  If you follow the directions, these types of hangers will stay up for years -- and when you do remove them, they don't peel paint.

Things they eliminate:1) Pictures that tilt on the wall over time.  We have a picture on the wall next to a door, and when we hung it from a nail we found that closing and opening the door over time always made it tilt to the side.  With these hanging strips, it stays right in place.2) You know when you hang pictures from two nails (one on each side) and you just can't QUITE get both sides even?  Not a problem with this, since it works kind of like velcro you can just get the pieces stuck on \"close enough\" and then adjust a little with no problem.Hanging pictures with these things is a breeze, and if you live in an apartment / dorm where you can't put holes in the wall, they are definitely worth it.

We first discovered these when I noticed how straight the picture frames were in my sister-in-law's gallery wall. They hung all of the frames with Command picture hanging strips. Our crooked frames were already hung with nails, so we used Command Stabilizer Strips to keep them straight - they work great!Once the stabilizer strips were taken care of, there were some other items to hang on our walls. We used the Picture Hanging Strips to hang wooden letters, a foamcore posterboard, and 11x14 canvases.The canvases are not the kind with a wood frame on the back, but the canvas is wrapped around something thin. They are maybe 3/8\" thick. My son has painted several of these at painting parties. It would probably be best to use two strips with them, in the top two corners, but we just used one in the center near the top. They are fairly lightweight and so far it has been fine.The reason we just used one in the center was because we wanted to hang then on our kids' doors part of the time, but we already had a Command hook there for holiday decorations. I ended up removing the hooks and putting a Picture-hanging strip on the back of the Command hook like it would go on the back of a picture. Then a Picture-hanging strip on the door. Now we can hang our Command hook on the door for lightweight holiday decorations (things like a Christmas stocking or felt jack-o-lantern). Or we can remove the hook and put my son's paintings up. It's great to have the versatility. We did have to trim the picture-hanging strip a bit to fit on the back of the hook, but that of course would depend on the size strip and hook you used. I also wouldn't stress the hook too much so we've only used lightweight decorations.As far as using them the normal way, we have been pleased with them. If you don't get it quite straight, remove the picture and try again. We used a small level on top of our frames before pressing the strips together.We had recently repainted our doors, so we made sure to wait a week before applying the strips.

These are terrific, and perform exactly as expected.Be careful when you buy them: the engineers at 3M have done a good job of designing them to hold specific amounts of weight, and mark them accordingly. If you are hanging a heavy 5-lb. picture mirror, for example, then you need to ensure that you read the fine print and not just buy the first item that shows up after you type \"3M Command\" as a search string. I've even weighed items using our kitchen scale to make sure I matched our to-be-hung items to the appropriate hook.As promised, they remove easily from household painted surfaces in our kitchen, bathroom, and living spaces.  We removed ours from enamel-based as well as latex-based paints.One last thing: these come in a variety of styles and finishes, too--so it's worth the extra time to search, read the fine print, and get the right one.\n"

I marked the location with a pencil, then placed the strips on the caddy and stuck the caddy on the cabinet door.  I resisted the urge to fill them immediately; I actually let them stay in place overnight before filling them.  These were a great problem-solver for me.

I plan on ordering more as I work my way through the house.  I've repeated this review for the medium and the large; other than the size they're identical products.  I would recommend measuring your cabinets carefully (not just the doors, but the inside frame of the cabinets and the location of the shelves to make sure it will fit).

They don't hold a ton of weight (half a pound each), but I used all 9 of them to create the perfect scarf holder.My walls are heavily textured so I was concerned that they wouldn't hold as well as a smooth wall, but after following the directions to the T, they are holding rather well. You really must be sure to put all your weight into it while holding it on there for the 30 seconds during application. I think this made all the difference. So far, so good! Just make sure when your putting the strips on the back that you are holding the hanger straight as the metal hooks can flop over and trick you if you aren't paying attention.\n"

These hooks held up all year for this purpose!! I also have one hanging at knee level behind the door of the classroom to hold the dustpan and it is used several times a day by the students as well. This hook held up all year too. I was leery of using these as they are expensive and of course, as a teacher, I have to buy my own for use in my classroom. These work so well on the painted brick walls that will continue to use them with confidence that things I hang will stay put. I'm too busy to have to keep rehanging items and certainly can't replace items that fall and break when a hook doesn't work. I will not buy generic ones again. Command Hooks just worked better.\n"

I followed directions for the latter, waited as instructed, and surprisingly none have ever fallen where you would expect\u2014in the shower\u2014when it's dry and esp when it's in use, and w/plenty of steam from hot water where the water doesn't actually hit.Some hooks on the side and the shower's other end are held on w/standard strips\u2014not water-resistant strips\u2014and nothing has ever budged, much less fallen. NOTE: I often will choose a hook or strip in excess of the weight of the object I'm hanging, choosing it not so much for its weight-limit but for its look or shape in the spot where I'm placing it.

With that many more people we have more things and less space and these hooks were a life saver! I had 2 of these hooks already and had bought them in the store but they discontinued selling them so I was SO happy to find that they had the exact same ones I was looking for on  Amazon! They are command brand so they come with the easy to attach double sided strips that hold a very good grip on the wall as well as having the ability to remove without ruining your walls. I have all satin nickel metal fixtures in my bathroom so these really blended in well with it and kept the classy look, you almost cant even tell they are plastic. I have not had any issues with them being inside the shower (and I have had the previous two for years now) but I did put them in spots that were noticeably less wet daily. Now we all have spots to hang our loofas!\n"

There is a hook to fulfill every kind of household need. I have attached a few pics for reference.The hooks adhesion and suction are impeccable, yet, it is so easy to remove.

They were ideal for mounting the 3 long under-cabinet lights above the kitchen counter, and the most-recent use was installing small shelves for the gnomes to sit on above the living room curtains. Adhesive pads were provided to hang the latter but one look at the damaged wall when a user tried to remove the shelf hung w/them was all it took to find another method.As for pictures themselves, though, they aren't ideal unless you're very precise w/your measurements. Once you press the picture frame or whatever you're hanging against them and the strips lock into place there's no straightening or adjusting it 'just a tad' w/o a lot of bother.Note, though, that the strips do tend to dry out over time and for that reason removing them isn't always as easy as 3M would have you believe. So if you find it necessary to remove any of them pull down VERY SLOWLY and you should have no problem.\n"

May not adhere to well to vinyl surfaces.DO NOT use for antiques, heirlooms, or other valuable or irreplaceable items.DO NOT hang items over beds.That really says it all, doesn't it? Don't hang anything of value and don't hang it in a place that will hurt if it falls on your head.These are easy to install and work great for collage-type projects, as you have the ability to place photos in an exact location. We have used them for things like smoke detectors, canvas art and smaller pictures. So far, they have worked well. It is very important that you follow the installation instructions. Be patient; make sure you wait the allotted 30 minutes before hanging your items. I usually wait longer, just to be on the safe side. The hanging strips come off cleanly and easily.Keep in mind when you are ordering these, the recommended usage for picture sizes are as follows:Small Strips:  1 set for a 3x5, 2 sets for a 5 x 7 and 4 sets for an 8 x 10.Medium Strips: 1 set for an 8 x 10, 2 sets for an 11 x 17 and 4 sets for an 18 x 20.I, personally, have never hung anything with only 1 strip; I've always used at least two.This package has 4 sets of small strips and 8 sets of medium strips.

For my needs, I have silicone casserole covers that I wanted to hang inside a cabinet door to keep them convenient. I had tried another brand of adhesive hook that I had replaced twice because they let go. In doing so, they left a yucky, sticky mess of stuck on adhesive.So I decided to find another alternative and found the Command hooks. In this case, I used the medium hooks because they are supposed to hold 3 pounds and the cover I wanted to hang were just under 3 pounds. I cleaned off the adhesive left by the other hooks, cleaned the area with alcohol as recommended, and left the Command hook on the door for an hour as recommended. So far it has been a couple of weeks and the hooks are holding. I couldn't be happier, and would highly recommend these hooks. I also suggest that any area you use the Command hooks is clean and smooth. This will help them to stick more permanently. I also love that these can be easily removed when you no longer need them.UPDATE 3/30/18:The hook that I originally installed on the back of a cabinet door to hold my silicone casserole covers in April of 2016 is still holding strong two years later.\n"

I originally wanted to use cable clips to run it, but it clearly didn't fit in the inexpensive cable clips.With these clips, I was able to run both my cables. I'd say you can probably run 3 RG-6 coax cables on this clip. Maybe even 4?

Until I got command hooks, that is. Make sure you follow the directions and clean the surface with some alcohol and let it dry completely. Also with holding it on to set and not hanging anything on it before the prescribed time. I have used both of these hooks in my classroom. One holds my jacket, the other my purse. I love them and definitely recommend using them. I did break one, hanging more than the prescribed amount on it. Although the hook itself broke, the base remained hanging, stuck tight to the wall. I love that about it! The adhesive was as easy to remove as they show in the commercials. It is amazing. So this purchase was actually to replace the last one I had broke, and that's when I decided I needed 2 hooks and not just one :)\n"

We've used them for so many things, including hanging our backpacks, plastic grocery bags, and purses on the wall rather than on the floor. This one is good for smaller items like re-usable grocery bags or jackets. There's a Jumbo version that I prefer that's truly amazing. I've hung my backpack with a full water bottle, laptop, and wallet on it and never had an issue. I've never had one leave a mark on my walls or remove paint, but on a door with a very dark wood finish/stain, they did take off a bit off the finish when removed. This didn't surprise me, because the finish was coming off on cleaning rags and stuff when I was dusting and cleaning. But still, use caution with dark wood surfaces.This size hook is great for hanging washcloths, dishcloths and towels (rather than throwing them over the edge of the faucet or sink, or hanging off the oven handle... which is what we did before). I've also used them to hang jewelry on the inside of my closet door.Make sure you follow the directions. The surface should be clean and dry. They recommend that you clean it with alcohol first, which can strip off some of the paint or finish, so be careful and gentle when you do that. The first time I did it, I really rubbed with the alcohol, which removed some of the paint from my wall.\n"

I hung a small 3x3 wall tile clock and needed a med size hook instead of a small due to the weight.  (The clock looks beautiful).  I participate in a lot of conference calls for my job so I use a headset. I got a large for that, not due to the weight but the size of the hook.  the small hooks were prettier but I got the medium because it had a larger hook that looked easier to hang the headset on and quickly take it off.  So my piece of advice is to look at what you are hanging because that might change. the hook you buy. Loe this and would buy again.\n"

If you are applying it to regular interior latex painted drywall, try this technique:1) Wash your hands with soap and water.2) Clean the wall area of any debris, and wipe with 91% rubbing alcohol. If you have heavy texturing, try to make it flat first.3) Clean the plastic wall clip part of the hook where the adhesion pad goes. Keep the two parts of the hook together. Do not put oily fingerprints on the back.4) Apply the hook-side adhesion layer to the hook, aligning the tab to point down toward the floor. Be careful to line it up to take up the full pad area with the adhesive strip.5) Apply the hook to the wall, carefully lining up the hooks exactly as you'd like.6) Carefully remove the hook from the wall clip (pull gently up from the hook side). This will expose the plastic wall clip that sticks to the wall.7) Press FIRMLY on the clip, against the wall, for 20-30 seconds. Try to remove any air bubbles.Doing this will give you a very strong bond to the wall. To remove, take off the hook part (pull up), then pull down on the tab slowly. The pad will come right off the wall.One note, be very careful when removing the hook from the wall clip. I pushed a little too hard and cut my finger from the sharp plastic on the wall clip. I don't think that's a product flaw at all. That was all me being clumsy. Just be careful.\n"

Since it's winter we can have a range of temperatures and weather patterns.  The mount was only used for a few months then removed.  Removal was easy with no residue or damage to the surface.  If these are used long term or more permanent then the experience could be different.  Short term use is great.The package notes how to install the strips.  It is much better to locate a YouTube video (being a visual learner) to ensure proper installation.  The refills arrived in an envelope with non OEM packaging.  They were sealed in a properly sized clear plastic bag.Since adopting the use of these 3M products and command strips, replacements were needed.  Various mounts are easily found in stores,  The replacement strips not so much.  In store options found were only packages with various sizes.  Only one size was needed so searched good ole Amazon and voila!  Not only did I find this bulk package for the size needed the price was great as well.  I should get a few years out of this one package since use is seasonal and short term.  Great product!\n"

I hung a small 3x3 wall tile clock and needed a med size hook instead of a small due to the weight.  (The clock looks beautiful).  I participate in a lot of conference calls for my job so I use a headset. I got a large for that, not due to the weight but the size of the hook.  the small hooks were prettier but I got the medium because it had a larger hook that looked easier to hang the headset on and quickly take it off.  So my piece of advice is to look at what you are hanging because that might change. the hook you buy. Love this and would buy again.\n"

My big canvas would continually fall & it was LOUD! Luckily it didn\u2019t mess up any wires & cables it fell onto. I was determined to make 2 COMMAND hooks to hold this canvas but after about 6 falls, paint ripping off the wall & bubbling of some paint behind where it hangs, I decided to look here on Amazon for a better solution. I\u2019ll admit, I spent a lot of time going through ALL the choices of adhesive hooks for hanging items until I finally found THIS hook for exactly what I needed to hang this particular, heavier canvas print. As soon as I got it, I immediately ripped into this, read the directions & placed the holder above all the paint ripped areas  After I let it on the wall over an hour to adhere, I finally placed my canvas print & it\u2019s been hanging, w/o falling even once! I didn\u2019t know COMMAND brand had specific holders just for canvas prints. This was a picture of a lotus opening in the morning when I was in Hawaii so this picture was so precious to me, getting it printed onto canvas & hanging it in my LR so I see it all day, every day, & no more falling  It was just too heavy for even 2 regular COMMAND hooks to hold it. I use these COMMAND brand hooks etc to hang all my pictures or actually canvas prints, most what I call 5 series canvas pics because it\u2019s a series of 5 canvas boards in varying sizes to progressively get smaller at the ends. These are light & easily can be hung by using 1 COMMAND hook since they\u2019re very light. When u get into bigger pics though, this is what is needed & this brand makes them.

The supplied clear plastic clips are not nearly as visible as the older white ones and they accept larger-diameter cords. Time will tell if they're sturdier. However, these clips are for lead dress or cable management, for keeping wires in their place. You should not get these clips if you intend to put much of a load on them. Overall, I'm pretty happy with these handy clips and intend to keep them around. Yes, they cost more, but they're still cheap enough to prefer them over lesser products.\n"

I couldn\u2019t stand the Ethernet cable that was snaked around my room to get to the other side and these clips gave me a much cleaner look to the room with no ugly cables standing out.  The clips hold the cable in place well and really clean up the look of a cable going around a door frame.  They work great on a flat smooth surface and hold tight as long as the surface is clean.  I have yet to use them on a slightly texturized surface so I can\u2019t share an opinion in that respect.  But in the case of mounting them to baseboards and smooth trim, they do exactly what they say.  I will definitely buy these again and would recommend them to anyone I know.\n"

I even made a place to hand my \"extra hands\" so I can get to them quickly.  I'm talking about those grabbers on a stick that allows you to reach places you can't get too when you get to be my age. I have 3 of them in difference parts of the house but they're always falling over.  Now I have them hanging right where I use them.These are easy to put up and really stick well.  I haven't had a hanging \"failure\" yet.  I did need both the large and the medium though.  The medium size had a narrower hook that sticks out a little further so things hang down properly.  I was out of medium hooks and had one item hanging on a medium that could go on a large hook so I took the medium off the wall and replaced it with a large so I'd have the medium for another location.  The hooks is SO easy to remove.  Really!!!  The front of the hook just snaps off the back. You grab a tab that hangs down from the \"stick um\" back that doesn't have sticky stuff on it and pull.  Slowly the sticky back just pulls off the wall and the hook is removed.  It left no residue on the wall.  I switched that hook to another location using the extra sticky backs they provide and all worked out great.  I'm ordering more medium asap.  I'm make a place to hang everything now....lol\n"

For my needs, I have silicone casserole covers that I wanted to hang inside a cabinet door to keep them convenient. I had tried another brand of adhesive hook that I had replaced twice because they let go. In doing so, they left a yucky, sticky mess of stuck on adhesive.So I decided to find another alternative and found the Command hooks. In this case, I used the medium hooks because they are supposed to hold 3 pounds and the cover I wanted to hang were just under 3 pounds. I cleaned off the adhesive left by the other hooks, cleaned the area with alcohol as recommended, and left the Command hook on the door for an hour as recommended. So far it has been a couple of weeks and the hooks are holding. I couldn't be happier, and would highly recommend these hooks. I also suggest that any area you use the Command hooks is clean and smooth. This will help them to stick more permanently. I also love that these can be easily removed when you no longer need them.UPDATE 3/30/18:The medium hook that I installed inside a cabinet door to hold my acrylic casserole covers is still holding strong after 2 years.\n"

The water flow with filter 1 is time-consuming to fill a cup of water, especially when everybody gets home around the same time and all want some ice water. Therefore, I recommend any household over four to purchase a water filter system rather than rely on the filtered water through the refrigerator. We recently switched to an under sink Waterdrop reverse osmosis water filtration system. Though it is pricy to purchase in the first place, the system definitely satisfied our water need and the replacement filters are also affordable considering the filter life and replace frequency. The system is also quite stylish and only takes very little space. I use the filtered water to make coffee and fresh OJs for my family in the morning and they all love it. I think the major reason is that the system reduces a great percentage of TDS in the original water, which the water after filtration is not that \u201chard.\u201dI used to find those ugly white scale deposits pile up on my kettle, but I do not have to deal with it anymore with the help of this RO system.\n"

I had a hard time figuring out whether this filter met the standards, as the information I could find only said it was NSF certified and did not list the specific standards or claims under each standard.  This meets NSF/ANSI 42 for taste (\"aesthetic effects\"), 53 for \"health effects,\" and 401 for \"emerging contaminants.\"  I'm attaching a picture of the NSF certification on the package that I received, but you can (and should) verify the certification and standards claimed by Whirlpool by searching for the filter under Whirlpool's old model number NL240V on the NSF website.  I was concerned about Atrazine (a pesticide that I found in my water) and lead.FILTER COMPATIBILITYSeveral reviews mention that this filter does not replace part #4396508.  My Whirlpool manual listed my replacement part as #4396508, and this fits.  I entered my model number on the Whirlpool website to verify compatibility.  The top of my filter looked exactly like the old one (which was a #4396508 left by the previous owner).  I don't know whether there are counterfeits or bad batches floating around, but I bought mine directly from Amazon and not from a third party seller.OTHER NOTES*Replacing the filter has really improved my water flow.*You have to flush four gallons--a lot--through the filter before you use it the first time.*Replace every 6 months.\n"

I wish you could attach more strips without having to plug in additional power cords and remotes and 2. it would be nice if the cords were longer so you don't have the power box hanging down your wall, attached to an extension cord.

For reference,  the picture above shows this brand (the red) and another brand (the white).  As you can see, the lights are more evenly spaced on this one.  My son has them up there kind of at random,  but if you were looking for precise results,  then this is important.  Although the remote is handy at times, I think it is best to buy ones that can be controlled through an app.  If you have more than one strip in a room, the remote can change those as well by accident.  With the app, you have more control over the exact color and pattern changes.  I also like that it can be set up to react to music or sound.

Sooo simple to put on... Unravel it first, before taking off the red backing map out your route then start sticking to you wall... It is shockingly so cool lol.. I didn't know if I would be ok with the whole club vibe but I figured let me stop low key hating because we didn't have this as kids ha! I played with all the settings myself until me teen kicked me out \ud83e\udd23 It really went around his whole room and around and under the window... If your child's room is the size of the \"Head of the house room\" than maybe get two boxes... We bought the box that has 3 rolls inside and that was perfect. It really gets bright but you can adjust it and make it dimmer... The blue is so subtle and not as harsh on the eyes in my opinion... But then again I don't like bright lights and I can't do led lights because I'm a migraine sufferer.. But as my son said \"Um, I love you but it's not your room... so you can go now\" ...

Therefore in my personal opinion, these are better suited as underglow rather than directly visible. In this regard, they are absolutely perfect. I have them set up as underglow for my bed and LOVE them. I could also see these working great as underglow for a desk or dresser. My favorite effect is the rainbow effect which looks phenomenal under my bed.The ability to control the strip in 3 different ways has to be my favorite part. All three methods, the controller, the remote, and the app, worked flawlessly for me. The app has the most options of the three, giving names for all the different modes and more precise control over things like color and speed. However, just about anything can be done with the remote and even the three button in-line controller as well, which is just spectacular.Another huge feature of this strip is the fact that it is powered via usb. No need for and huge power adapters or anything fancy. I plugged them in to a samsung brick and it worked great for me. This makes the whole setup much more reparable in the case something breaks. Absolutely love that.\n"

When selecting a color or pattern, the same color and pattern goes across all 4 strips.  These LEDs are NOT individually addressable.  If you want to have that functionality, like light chasing patterns, or each LED to be of a different color than its neighbors, then you need to look at a different style of LED Strip (look for DREAMCOLOR or \u201cChasing LED\u2019s\u201d in the descriptions).The lights are NOT WEATHER PROOF or WATERPROOF.  These lights were designed to be in an indoor configuration as the diodes for the LED are simply surface mounted and exposed to the environment with no protection on a carrier strip.  So behind a TV, under inside cabinets and molding, and accent lights for a room or under a bed would be a great place to put these.The adhesive on the strip looks to be \u201cjust barely strong enough\u201d to hold it in place. So if you intend to have it mounted for a longer time, I would suggest looking into adding or replacing the adhesive that comes with the strips or using some mounting hardware or dedicated LED strip mounting channels. If you want to beef up the adhesive, 3M makes great adhesive tapes for this need.The strip itself is basically a flexible circuit board where the diodes and other surface mount components are affixed.  The LEDs are 50x50mm and each LED carrier contains separate diodes for Red, Green, or Blue in the physical package.  While this configuration does give great color for the 3 primary colors, giving combinations of colors (like an orange, or a yellow, or a white) is not as pure as what you might be expecting, but all in all still pretty good. The strips have cut areas about every 6.5\u201d so you can trim the length of the strip to match most desired lengths.  Each section has 3 LED packages on it, giving an equivalent of 3 Red, 3 Green, and 3 Blue LED\u2019s per strip.  There is no additional \u201cwhite\u201d LED (cold or warm) on this strip.If you do choose to cut and splice, make sure you get the 4 conductor connectors for LED strips. It is possible to buy extra connecting hardware to splice back in cut lengths together \u2014 however, I would suggest keeping the total length of one powered run as what was provided by the factory \u2014 unless you can engineer in more +12V power supplies.  From what I have seen as \u201cstandard issue\u201d, a 12V 1.25A supply should power 1 leg of 5M (16.5\u2019) of LEDs.The Remote is Infra-Red \u2014 you have to point the remote at the IR LED that comes off the controller.  If you don\u2019t have a clear line of sight between the remote and the controller, you won\u2019t be able to control the lights.  If you want to have it so that you can control it via Radio signals, look for a replacement controller that does support RF operations.This controller is NOT MUSIC / SOUND sensitive.The Power supply is sufficient to power the four included rolls of LED Strip lighting with no apparent issues. The power supply cord from the wall to the power brick is a little on the short side ( about 18\u201d ) and the length from the power brick to the barrel connector was about 3 feet \u2014 and is as usually expected for a generally sourced 12v 5A power adapter. It is 2 pronged which is typical for the US power grid, and this version did not have interchangeable power connectors in case you wanted to install these in UK, FR, etc.So, again, these strips function as specified, so no issues there.  Just make sure that these give you the ability to get you the quality of light you need and only use these indoors in an average humidity environment.\n"

It's a twist knob to switch from brita filtered water to regular faucet water. The twist knob is much harder to use and I have a fear if I twist too hard it will break or the whole attachment will fall.2. This new design is much smaller, but much louder to use for plain old faucet water. You can practically wake up the house.3. The way the filter dispenses filter water is no longer stream line. Instead, it sprays, so if you're filling up a bottle that has a narrower opening, majority of the filtered water will end up outside the bottle onto the sink. Not to mention, it takes much longer to fill up a bottle.\n"

It's very small and should fit in tight spaces with in your refrigerator.The replacement indicator is a very poor design. It contains a single-use battery that lasts approximately 5 years. After the battery dies it cannot be replaced since it's in a sealed compartment. This does not bode well for a company that brags that you will be saving the landfilled approximately 1800 bottles a year, if you use their product. Supposedly you can still use the pitcher after 5 years but the indicator light will no longer work. This also makes me think Britta is probably figuring their pitcher will need to be replaced every five years.The pitcher is able to use the standard filter as well as the blue long last filter. Using the blue long last filters cost a few dollars more, compared to buying enough of the standard filters to last the same amount of time. However they don't need to be changed as often and you'll save the planet from a little extra waste.Overall I think the pitcher is adequate. But I would like to see a more durable pitcher as this one is made out of cheap plastic. Several years ago I had one that dropped and broke into several pieces. They're not exactly durable. It seems like after several years Brita would have came out with a better quality product. But like all things in business they're designed to wear out in order for business to make more money. So treat this one with care and it should last over 5 years.I highly recommend hand washing it will save your pitcher from harsh dishwashing dishwashers.\n"

Instead the water pours from the straw after a few seconds delay, which is frustrating when trying to refill at a water fountain in public, with water pouring sometimes all over the floor surrounding if one forgets to drain the straw.

I am not a patient person, and I absolutely despise standing over the sink waiting for the water to trickle into the bottom of the old pitcher that filtered between a top and bottom level, excruciatingly slowly, so I could fill it up enough to at least get two water bottles worth before filling it again. In each model I ever had the top level-- pre filtered-- would hold about a quarter as much water as the bottom level, so you'd have to wait for water to filter through the top into the bottom and then refill the top at least 3 times before the bottom was full. I rarely had the patience for that and just wouldn't bother, so I never ended up actually having enough cold filtered water.This filters the water as you pour it out of the pitcher rather than as you fill up the pitcher, so you can fill it to the top very quickly and easily and always have cold water in the fridge ready to go into a bottle or glass.It does still have to filter the water, so you're moving the waiting step to when you pour it into a glass or water bottle. It does take less time than the old style pitcher, and most importantly you aren't stuck over the sink waiting for the process to finish.Even though this costs more than the other type of pitchers it's much more affordable than the type that attaches to the sink. The replacement filters for those are painfully expensive, and personallyI think the water from this style of filter tastes better.This does have a light on the lid to indicate when the filter needs replacing, which I think is a helpful feature.One thing I've found is that when there's not much water left in the pitcher it filters much more slowly, so it's helpful to refill it before it's empty to save the frustration. It also took me a couple minutes tofigure out the instructions for how to place the filter, which turned out to be very, very easy when done correctly, so if you're struggling to remove the filter cover you're most likely doing it wrong.\n"

I used to use that other brand, but was prompted to change because their filters were only lasting a month each, and they were quite expensive - not to mention the rotting fish flavor they added to the water at the end of their life.So, what about this one? First, I love that it's a stand-alone pitcher. If you're a renter or have specialized fixtures already in your kitchen, you'll be glad you don't have to install anything permanent or temporary to use this filter system. You unpack it, install the filter, rinse the filter and you're in business. The convenience is terrific!I ordered the long-last filter, but received the standard filter instead. The merchant has already satisfactorily remedied that problem. But, please note that I'm actually writing about the standard filter. (I'm sure the long-last will be comparable.)The flavor of the water is great. Water in my neck of the woods can vary considerably from one day to the next, so this is a real plus. I went for a few weeks without using a filter and in that short time I started getting a lot of deposits on glasses and my electric kettle. As soon as I put this filter into use, that buildup stopped. So, I know it is removing stuff from my water.I had to ding it one star because if there's any water in the top (unfiltered) reservoir, it is a real mess to pour any water. It dribbles out through the non-existent seal around the top, runs down your hand, across the countertop, onto the floor, etc. So, you have to wait until the top reservoir is empty before pouring yourself a glass of water - or clean up the mess if you don't. It seems this could be easily remedied with a small redesign of the pitcher.I'd recommend this filter system for sure. It removes lead and a lot of other impurities. It makes the water taste great and stops deposits in your glasses and kettles and whatever. It is pretty economical (especially compared to bottled water), easy to use, doesn't require anything to be installed and doesn't add the flavor of rotting fish to your water.\n"

It has an indicator that is pressure sensitive. As the pressure increases with usage (the filtration system gets clogged with sediment, etc), a little window mechanically turns from green to half green/red to finally all red which means one should change the filter.-After 2 filter replacements, I replace the bottom unit (the filtration system).-the engineering is not the greatest but it performs satisfactorily. It does develop minor leaks probably due to poor seals.-Also the selector handle gets harder and harder to turn due to the poor seal design and solute deposition but changing the base unit periodically solves that.There are 2 important variables here: water pressure and degree of sediment/particulate/solutes in the local water system.

          "\n  The concept is great, a large-capacity Brita filtered water pitcher for the fridge with a handy spigot so the whole thing doesn\u2019t have to be removed for each use. I\u2019ve always seen the convenience in that idea compared to the Brita filtration pitchers I\u2019ve used for years that take up space in my refrigerator door and have to be refilled after each use.Once I got this dispenser home I began to realize that there are pros and cons to its design, some of which may be difficult to overcome.Here\u2019s a brief outline about what I like and what turned out to be not so great about this dispenser:PROS1. The unit seems to be made about the same as most Brita filtration pitchers, which is to say, it is made well. The plastic is a hard polycarbonate that does not alter the taste of the water, is easy to clean and is relatively safe from cracking and shattering.2. Part of the top is hinged and folds back to refill the dispenser (using another container) so the whole thing doesn\u2019t have to be taken to the sink.3. There is a drainage trough molded in to the bottom of the dispenser (one of the reviewers who didn\u2019t like this product is not accurate about not being able to fully empty the container, the drainage trough permits the dispenser to drain almost fully empty. Look at their photo of the product \u2026 it is for an entirely different product that doesn\u2019t even look like the one being sold here, apparently the dispenser has been completely redesigned).4. It uses standard Brita filters which are available almost everywhere.CONS1. The #1 negative is the actual height top-to-bottom of the dispenser is about 10-1/2\u201d. It is impossible for me to arrange my refrigerator to accommodate something that tall. Checking with family and friends most of them said their shelves don\u2019t adjust that far apart either.2. The hole in the spigot is about \u00bc\u201d from the shelf the dispenser is placed on so there is no way to actually use it without pulling the spigot out over the edge of a shelf each time.3. The idea of the hinged refill lid sounds great until you learn that it takes up about eight more inches above the dispenser (even more to allow room for the container you\u2019re pouring from), so in reality you need almost 20\u201d between the shelves in your refrigerator.4. Removing the entire lid (like to replace the filter cartridge) is awkward. The best way to do it is to open the hinged filler lid to grab the lid for removal. That puts a lot of strain on the hinge.5. There are no real carry handles on the dispenser, which can get heavy when filled with water. There are only two very small plastic handles at either end which are difficult to grab and make the dispenser difficult to carry.I still like Brita pitchers and I actually still like this large dispenser, but with the caution that you will need a space to put it that is almost 20\u201d tall and that you can hang the spigot over the edge of the shelf without it getting in the way (if I were to hang it over the edge of the shelf in my refrigerator it would hit the door shelves which are spaced the same as my interior shelves).  I did find a handy alternative location but I would rather have been able to use it at reachable level on my refrigerator\u2019s main shelf.\n"

My friend had this same unit at his house and once I had a taste of the water I was pleasantly surprised that I've been wrong all these years. Prior to buying my water pitcher, I always purchased those 2.5gal water jugs. They were such a pain in the rear to lug. Not to mention it took up lots of valuable kitchen space.I was reluctant to order this model because of the reviews regarding the lid. My friend said he never had issues though. When I made my purchase, I had to send mine right back! My unit had the same lid falling off issue a lot of people complained about in their reviews. I later decided to take my chances and order a replacement though, being as how much I loved the taste of the water, the size of the pitcher, and the cost.  Lucky for me, my second unit hasn't given me any issues. The lid sometimes may budge a little but it doesn't completely pry open or fall off. Just don't overfill it and watch the lid when you pour.I've been reading that this unit actually doesn't filter out lead, or maybe not at the levels where they can legally advertise as so. That's the reasoning behind the minus 1 star. I live in an old house with old pipes which I'm sure probably has lead. I'll need to find a solution for that, but that's another issue.Another note about the filter...make sure it fits in properly! The first time I used it I didn't realize I was putting the filter in wrong. I thought it was snug in it's place, but turns out it wasn't!! So I was drinking just partially filtered water. You can tell if it's seated correctly by the way it fits, but also when you fill the pitcher with water, the water should come out from the bottom of the filter a bit slowly. If it's filling up super fast, it's probably not seated properly!\n"

It turns out that the top for this pitcher fits tightly when placed with the hinged flap over the pouring spout, as shown in the picture. But fits 99.99% of the way when turned around so that the hinged flap is resting on the handle. As we discovered, if you take the lid off of the pitcher, as you will do to wash the pitcher or put in a new filter, it is quite easy to pick it up and put it back on the wrong way around without realizing it. This has never been an issue with other Britta models.Because we were alert to the \"top doesn't quite fit\" issue for this model from other reviews, we had two people testing it at various stages, with one person saying the top fit tightly and the other saying it didn't. We brought in a third person, who said, \"Doesn't fit.\" The first one said, \"You just press it down,\" tried to do so, found either the front fit or the back did but not both, and then we all three suddenly realized the hinged flap goes in front, not resting on the handle. And then it was fine for everyone.Although the right way round is obvious once you know to look for it, we found that all three of us were mostly placing the top by feel--our eyes tended to be on the container we were going to be pouring into. It was just automatic to scoop up the top, slip it in place, and start pouring. We didn't stop to check the alignment until we knew we had to.I checked our two older Britta pitchers, and on both the top fits either way round. If any Britta designers read these reviews, I suggest they change the future shape of the Grand slightly so it's really obvious by feel that it doesn't fit when placed incorrectly.I like a lot of things about the pitcher. It's much larger capacity than the Slim, but still fit easily on the refrigerator door. It was well balanced. No plastic smell out of the box, unlike some other brands we've tried. The water tastes noticeably crisper than tap. Frustration free packaging. The filter fits tightly and fills pretty quickly.But I can only give it 4 stars because of the top design. It is just a little too easy to get it wrong until you know exactly how it fits, especially if, as all 3 of us did, you're directing your attention to the next step in the process.\n"

During the past 6 months or more when I noticed the PUR filtered water didn't taste as good as at my other home, I was buying 4 cases of bottled water a week defeating the purpose of a faucet filter and relegated the filtered water to making coffee and cooking.Thus far I'm satisfied with Brita and happy not to have to spend money on bottled water anymore.

Just last week, one (top left) of the eight sticky hanging strips stuck to THE DOOR fell off, and the weight of the mirror brought the entire mirror down. It had lost it's stickiness. The velcro parts of the strips are still going strong. I just stuck the strip back on the door until I can get more command strips. I believe the strip wouldn't have fallen off if I just left left the mirror on the door for the whole year. However, I occasionally needed to move the mirror out, pulling the velcro. I believe this is an excellent purchase based on the duration I can use these strips (the rest of the strips are still sticky).Used to attach a full length mirror (7 pounds) from Target to the back of my door. See pictures for results.The strips were a bit too long for the surface I used them on, so I cut each strip in half WIDTH WISE, giving me 8 pieces to use. This was not the best technique (should have done length wise, as it left me with only one side containing the pull tab that is used to later remove the strip. (Solved the problem by making sure that each strip had at least one pull tab & then adhered that side to the surface of the DOOR.) I didn't really care that the back of my cheap mirror might get damaged, should I decide to remove the strips from there.Moving on, the set-up was easy and took about 15 minutes for me. As per the instructions, I let the strips rest for a few hours before attaching the mirror to the door.The mirror is stuck on well. I swung the door open & closed with much force a few times to test it, and nothing shakes or even wobbles.I can easily pull the mirror from the door and set it elsewhere to use. Reattachment is simple.It has been 1 month and the mirror hasn't fallen once.Based on the many horror stories from other reviews, I am a bit worried about the strips potentially damaging the surface of the door upon removal. Will update on that issue when I remove the strips.Overall a good purchase for what I needed it for.\n"

My two frames were about 5 lbs each.  Being totally scared to come home to find them on the floor with glass shards all over, I doubled up and used two hangers per frame.I found that you must follow the instructions very carefully or it won't hold.  You must clean the wall surface with alcohol to remove any dirt and let dry which should be quick.  Then adhere the hanger and press and hold for 30 secs.  Then let it sit for a day BEFORE you hang your frame.  I think this allows the adhesive to bond with the wall surface for a tighter grip.

Just last week, one (top left) of the eight sticky hanging strips stuck to THE DOOR fell off, and the weight of the mirror brought the entire mirror down. It had lost it's stickiness. The velcro parts of the strips are still going strong. I just stuck the strip back on the door until I can get more command strips. I believe the strip wouldn't have fallen off if I just left left the mirror on the door for the whole year. However, I occasionally needed to move the mirror out, pulling the velcro. I believe this is an excellent purchase based on the duration I can use these strips (the rest of the strips are still sticky).Used to attach a full length mirror (7 pounds) from Target to the back of my door. See pictures for results.The strips were a bit too long for the surface I used them on, so I cut each strip in half WIDTH WISE, giving me 8 pieces to use. This was not the best technique (should have done length wise, as it left me with only one side containing the pull tab that is used to later remove the strip. (Solved the problem by making sure that each strip had at least one pull tab & then adhered that side to the surface of the DOOR.) I didn't really care that the back of my cheap mirror might get damaged, should I decide to remove the strips from there.Moving on, the set-up was easy and took about 15 minutes for me. As per the instructions, I let the strips rest for a few hours before attaching the mirror to the door.The mirror is stuck on well. I swung the door open & closed with much force a few times to test it, and nothing shakes or even wobbles.I can easily pull the mirror from the door and set it elsewhere to use. Reattachment is simple.It has been 1 month and the mirror hasn't fallen once.Based on the many horror stories from other reviews, I am a bit worried about the strips potentially damaging the surface of the door upon removal. Will update on that issue when I remove the strips.Overall a good purchase for what I needed it for.\n"

You must clean the wall surface with alcohol to remove any dirt and let dry which should be quick.  Then adhere the hanger and press and hold for 30 secs.  Then let it sit for a day BEFORE you hang your frame.  I think this allows the adhesive to bond with the wall surface for a tighter grip.  Before I hung my frames, I also tugged down on them with a bit of force to test if they would come off.  I've had my frames hanging for about a year now and they seem to be ok.\n"

Then apply the command product  to the surface OUSH HARD AND HOLD THEN YOU MUST WAIT 24 TO 36 HRS before adding AMY weight.

One of the hooks did not adhere properly and left one painting on the floor and the paint pulled off of The wall.

In fact, I bought them because I thought they would allow for easy removal without destroying my wall. However, the ease of removal without taking the paint depends on what you are adhering. You either need to be using a pliable material like paper so that you can pull up a corner to access the command strip or you need to allow the command strip to hang down past the end of the material so that you can pull the strip. This I did not do because a) the instructions did not say to do it and b) then I couldn't have gotten all my panels to line up without gaps.\n"

The remote and receiver have enough range for any standard sized bedroom, but the control box must be within line of sight due to the use of infrared. This small issue is exacerbated by the unnecessarily short power lead. The cord is barely able to reach my outlet from 10ft ceilings.One last thing worth mentioning is that these go further than I would have expected. I only needed about two and a half of the four strips included to line the perimeter of my ceiling. Ultimately, I think that these are plenty functional for the price, bearing in mind the caveats previously mentioned.\n"

But I used them none the same. I thought it was my imagination that the water tasted different which perhaps it is, but since the filter hardly lasted 2 months before being at 0% (not 25%) I think I would've been better off to go directly with the Brita filters.  The filters I got directly from Brita each lasted 4-6 months, the water tasted cleaner and they were damp when I got them not sure if that makes a difference in the quality (I did some reading and the verdict was split). They were not that much more so the extra cost would be worth the extra life. It's also not like I just increased my water intake if anything I've been drinking less water.\n"

It is big enough for the two of us, though only just. I care about filtering suspended particles only in that I do not want them in my coffee maker. In so far as I can tell the pitcher does what it is supposed to do and in doing its thing, we have no indications that our coffee maker is becoming fouled with suspended solids.Among the features that play out for us, the locking lid can be tricky. It pays off in reducing spills, esp when we have water in the reservoir while we add water to the coffee maker. . I know that it is filtering at least some of the suspended solids because when we finally changed the filter is had more than doubled in weight and we could see some of the particulate backed up in the filter.This brings us to the feature I do not trust, or have found trust worthy: The indicator light. Exactly how it senses the status of the filters is unknown. I suspect and have some reason to that it is a simple counter that counts down based on, perhaps the number of times you press the on button. Otherwise I suspect it is designed to promote sales of replacement filters more than designed to track the condition of the filter. When we notice that it was taking more time to filter water and look to see the status of the filter is when we change the filter. Our way takes no electronics and gave us the result we wanted. I have never seen the indicator light be anything but green.Disassembly is very hard. If you are picky about having the ability to clean in detail, our experience has not been positive. We can clean it sufficient for our sensitivities.Overall we like our Brita Large 10 Cup Water Filter Pitcher. If that is all there was to say; it functions mostly as promised and is deserving of four stars. However I am suspicious of the electronics; do not believe they are needed and cannot witness to its reliability.\n"

          "\n  \u00a0We've been using Brita pitcher systems since 2012 and the promise of the new Stream pitcher system was pretty attractive to us at first - Cut the wait times associated with traditional pitcher filter systems and have instant filtered water. However in reality I was actually left underwhelmed with what it offered and there were too many compromises, with what was I was okay with, in order to achieve a flow that is only a moderate at best and unuseable at its worst. Here's why I feel this way :FILTRATION & CONTAMINANT REMOVAL- The whole point of any filtration system to remove most of the harmful contaminants in the water we drink and here's where I feel most of the compromises were made to achieve a 'fast' flow- I've included a pic taken from Brita's own website comparing the contaminant removal from their own filtration systems. As you can see the stream filters *only removes* the Chlorine taste from your tap water and if you cant notice the Chlorine taste in you water in the first place (like In my area)  then there is really no difference drinking straight from the tap or through this filter- Unlike standard pitcher & faucet filters, It *does not* filter out harmful chemicals like Mercury, Nickel , Copper, Zinc , Cadmium etc- The Stream filters are only good for 40 gallons and at the time of writing this review cost about $6.46 a pop ($19.39 for a 3 pack).  Compare that to Brita's own regular pitcher filters which cost about $4.89 for a filter ( $14.69 for 3 Pack). The regular pitcher filters are also good for 40 gallons- You can see where I'm going about the Value proposition for the Stream filters - They are about 30% more expensive than the regular filter , yet they remove only 1/5th (20%) of the contaminants the regular pitcher does ( 1 v/s 5) . I mean why pay top dollar when you can have better filtered water from the same brand for lessWATER FLOW RATES- So the whole point of all the above compromises was a faster water flow , however as you can see from my video that the flow rate from the pitcher (when its full and has the most pressure against the filter) is only moderate at best- This flow rate gets progressively slower as your pitcher empties and slows down to significantly once the pitcher is half empty and the water level looses contact with the filter- Once you reach the last quarter of the pitcher , the flow slows down to almost a trickle making it a test of your patience and forcing you to refill the pitcher again. This makes a 10 cup pitcher more  like a '7 cup actually usable' to meTHE GOOD- The pitcher is good looking and looks great on any table- Fits your fridge door easily and can filter iced water- Tight seal , the pitcher does not leak no matter how high you tilt it- Better than drinking tap water alone (That is if the water in your area has a strong chlorine odor/taste)THE NOT SO GOOD- The value proposition just doesn't cut it for me , When compared to Brita's own regular pitcher filters , it removes 80% lesser contaminants for 30% higher the cost. And I'm not even talking about faucet filters or other brands here.- On top of that the water flow rate did not turn out to be the redeeming quality I sought it to be as it gets progressively slower as you empty the pitcher making a 10 cup pitcher more like a 7 Cup oneFINAL THOUGHTSIn the end, though the Brita filter not bad by any means, but I feel there are too many compromises and that you can do so much better for both in terms of cost and quality of filtered water. So there you have it . At one end, With the Stream Pitcher you have \"fast\" filtered water which is more expensive and has fewer contaminants removed and at the other end you have Cheaper, Healthier filtered water for less with a regular Pitcher with the only caveat that you have to wait ~5 mins for the water to filter. And that was an easy decision for me ...\n"

I had a Brita years ago, and so, when I got a deal for some dollars off (don't remember the exact amount), I opted to give this pitcher a try.The pitcher holds a good amount of water which is fabulous, sort of, when I'm cooking. The sad truth is that, while there is certainly more water in the pitcher, I cannot access it all because the filter falls out when I tip the pitcher over to pour out the last half of the water. This is a huge flaw and defeats the purpose of having the larger pitcher. It seems to me, that in days past, the filter was given a bit of a turn which locked it in place.That flaw aside, the water tastes much nicer than straight tap water.\n"

She did mention that even adhesive tape has a shelf life (OK who knew that one, really?)Over time, the glue will adhere to the paper strip backing, and when you remove the backing, the glue will come off with it.They did offer to send me some refill strips, so in their defense, they do have good customer service.

          "\n  I bought these because at the time I was living in a house that I was renting and the landlord asked that we didn't put any holes in the walls that weren't  already there.  Well, I am an interior decorator and not having pictures on the walls was not an option for me.  I feel having things on the walls makes a house feel much more homey.  Especially when you have bare white walls, How boring!I bought a ton of these hoping they would solve all my problems, While they did solve most of them.  I feel like this product is pretty expensive to be hanging tons of pictures with.  you need quite a few to hang pictures and when I was only used a few  on all my bigger pictures (bigger than 8X10) The pictures would fall off the wall within a few weeks.  If they do fall of the wall, they are pretty much useless from there, because they are hard to line back up with the sticky part on the wall and I found it easier just to put a whole new set on them. That got to be pretty expensive!!!!So they work if you stick tons of command strips on the picture or if you have smaller pictures you want to hang but if you need hang any bigger heavier pictures, I would not recommend these.  I  broke several of my pictures by not having enough on them.  Also I spent an arm and a leg on these trying to buy enough to hang all the pictures.  you could use these for some pictures and wall hanging items but definetly not for all pictures.  Anything bigger than about an 8x10 I wouldn't recommend these, unless you want to have at least 4 or 5 on the pictures.  I used 6 for my 16x20 that I hung with them and so far haven't had any issues.  If you go bigger than 16x20, I think you would need around 8 or more. Again, that gets super expensive and I have  to wonder is it worth it!?I finally decided just to get small nails and use those.  When I left the place I filled the holes with a little toothpaste (trick learned in college) and you could never even tell that the nail was there.  That worked way better and was WAY less expensive than buying packages and packages of these.\n"

The Command Strip seemed to be holding everything securely in place.  So far, so good.This morning, I discovered that the Command Strip had almost completely separated from the vinyl siding, leaving the camera only moments away from crashing to the concrete below.  But, the side of the tape attached to the back of the camera mount remained securely in place.The temperature in our area ranged from approximately 59\u00b0, down to approximately 30\u00b0 F, between the time I affixed the camera mount to the vinyl siding, and the time I attached the camera to the mount.  The tape is rated to be applied between 15\u00b0 & 125\u00b0 F.I\u2019ve been successfully using 3M Command products for years, but this one failed the test.\n"

In other words, work fine for hanging pictures on walls (vertical orientation) but not under tables.Also note: After separating the 2 sides, it's taking me a lot of pressure to get them to re-stick together again.  Instead of traditional \"hook and loop\" style velcro, each strand is shaped more like the heads of a nail and you need to press really hard to get them to grab onto each other. Also, the strands can get matted down, making it harder to grab.It's a solid hold if you can get them to grab.

They really do hold their designated weight well, are easy to use, and come off the surface leaving no marks.I got these hooks for various small hanging tasks, among which are lightweight pictures. They will work for such, though the instructions that came with them insist they shouldn't be used with pictures, at all. I'm not sure what difference it makes in the long run.One thing that was annoying is these hooks are the anti-fancy. They are plain, to the point of being best used in service spaces. They will always be visible above whatever you use them for.Also, if you use them for something that you will often remove from the hook, such as keys, the hook isn't stationary. It' isn't attached to the wall in any way--only the white base is. So every time you lift something off the hook the hook lifts too, creating a bit of a tangle to get the thing off the hook. I'd rather the hooks be fully adhered to the base and not move.Also, I did not receive the correct number of hooks and adhesives in my box. I only received 14 hooks. I would get Command hooks again, though not from this vendor, and not this style.\n"

The directions were a bit hazy on how to put the tray back on the holders because it looks like they tell you to slide it on but I couldn't and almost broke the first one. Seems you need to put it part way on then slide it up into place. I didn't take any changes with the second one and just left it in one piece when I attached it to the cabinet (I still was able to push where the tape is through the thing, it is plastic)  since the part that slides into the 'clips' that hold it up are thin plastic and as I said, I almost broke the first one just trying to get it on. They do come with a sponge (scrubber part on other side) which is nice but those trays can't hold much else but the one sponge the long way. When I tried to stand the sponge up and stick a second one in the tray and close the cabinet door, the sponges just toppled out. The tray is too shallow to let sponges stand up in them as you can see in the photo, it don't even come half way up. (The second photo shows where it comes up on the sponge the long way which still isn't that high but I didn't have any problems with it falling out.) While these are okay for now, I will be looking for something a little more sturdy and I can fit a couple of sponges in. I really didn't want holes in the inside of the cabinet but these (even the one I put on as directed) are a bit wobbly and I don't expect they will last that long.

Well, I am an interior decorator and not having pictures on the walls was not an option for me.  I feel having things on the walls makes a house feel much more homey.  Especially when you have bare white walls, How boring!I bought a ton of these hoping they would solve all my problems, While they did solve most of them.  I feel like this product is pretty expensive to be hanging tons of pictures with.  you need quite a few to hang pictures and when I was only used a few  on all my bigger pictures (bigger than 8X10) The pictures would fall off the wall within a few weeks.  If they do fall of the wall, they are pretty much useless from there, because they are hard to line back up with the sticky part on the wall and I found it easier just to put a whole new set on them. That got to be pretty expensive!!!!So they work if you stick tons of command strips on the picture or if you have smaller pictures you want to hang but if you need hang any bigger heavier pictures, I would not recommend these.  I  broke several of my pictures by not having enough on them.  Also I spent an arm and a leg on these trying to buy enough to hang all the pictures.  you could use these for some pictures and wall hanging items but definetly not for all pictures.

Eventhough the area doesn't get wet, I had to use the waterproof ones to get them to stay.  My cabinets are the easy clean/ scratch resistant Thermo-foil cabinets if that helps any.I tried to use the cord ones on the beams in my basement, and anywhere that the cord had resistance to be against the beam it eventually pulled away.  If you know how beams are, I wasn't surprised, but I did clean it well and tried to put it in a place that was smooth--and even tried sanding it smooth and it didn't stay.  I was hoping it worked, but knew the likelihood of it working was small.  I was hoping that I wouldnt have to put those staple in the beams, but will have to be done eventually.\n"

I stuck the non-wall side of the Command Strip to the Blink\u2019s lightweight plastic mount. Then, I pressed the mount against the vinyl siding and held it there for one minute, to assure a secure bond between the mount and the siding.Yesterday, I attached the Blink camera to the mount.  The Command Strip seemed to be holding everything securely in place.  So far, so good.This morning, I discovered that the Command Strip had almost completely separated from the vinyl siding, leaving the camera only moments away from crashing to the concrete below.  But, the side of the tape attached to the back of the camera mount remained securely in place.The temperature in our area ranged from approximately 59\u00b0, down to approximately 30\u00b0 F, between the time I affixed the camera mount to the vinyl siding, and the time I attached the camera to the mount.  The tape is rated to be applied between 15\u00b0 & 125\u00b0 F.I\u2019ve been successfully using 3M Command products for years, but this one failed the test.\n"

They will always be visible above whatever you use them for.Also, if you use them for something that you will often remove from the hook, such as keys, the hook isn't stationary. It' isn't attached to the wall in any way--only the white base is. So every time you lift something off the hook the hook lifts too, creating a bit of a tangle to get the thing off the hook.

Our water in Palm Bay, FL has possibly lower particulates than average, so I was able to 'reset' the automatic reminder on our fridge (by removing and immediately reinstalling the same filter) several times before replacing the filter with a new one when flow decreased roughly by 50%.The filter itself consists of a thin cloth-like outer membrane surrounding an activated compressed powdered charcoal core. (See uploaded photos.) This might be compared to a 'finishing' filter in an RO system. If your fridge is connected to a reverse-osmosis system with such a filter, you might be able to skip replacement of this filter and only change the RO filters as needed.)I'm not sure why this filter is so expensive except that it's form-factor is quite specific to this model refrigerator and would be difficult to bypass or replace without considerable effort.

If I had known that this filter would take about 3 hours to filter water every time I filled the pitcher, I would have kept ordering the regular filters. I understand that since this is a longer lasting filter, that the filter will take longer to purify the tap water. But waiting 3 hours each fill up is beyond excessive. It's gotten to the point that I can't possibly keep this for another 2-4 months until I need to replace it. It is aggravating to say the least. Especially since it's summer and we drink a lot more water this time of year. We might pass out from dehydration before the pitcher fills with cleaned water!I have taken the steps that other's have mentioned: taking out the filter and hitting it a bit to get air bubbles out (doesn't help), re-soaking & running the filter under cold water for 15 seconds (doesn't help) and I've made sure that the filter has been properly inserted and created a seal.Bottom line, this is a filter for water and it does just that. But a 3 hour water fill up is unacceptable. I have been using Brita filters for at least 15 years now and have never had a problem like this one.

I then placed the refilled pitcher in a dish to contain leakage.  24 hours later there was no dampness. It became clear that the small cracks were the problem.

I loved this these hooks when I first discovered them; the walls in my home are practically made from concrete which makes putting nails in extremely difficult bordering on nearly impossible.I had several pieces hanging on my walls using different sized strips/hooks, all of which were hung around 5 to 6 years ago (maybe longer) over a period of approximately a year+. The product worked exactly as intended until suddenly a few months ago I hear a loud noise in another room and discover a framed piece had fallen from the wall. After all this time the adhesive backing completely failed completely, the back of the hook was no longer sticky at all.I assumed it was a freak accident and a few weeks to a month later the same exact thing happened (luckily this piece was hung using two hooks and only one failed). Still being a huge fan of the product I really didn't give the situation the critical eye that I should have. Skip ahead maybe another two months and this time something that had been hanging for years fell off the wall in front of my eyes because the adhesive suddenly failed. I really don't know what to make of the situation, there wasn't any extreme weather that might have caused a problem and all instructions were followed when installed.My best guess is that the adhesive material dried out over time. Reading other reviews I see cases where the hooks fail after weeks or even months but not years. This product was still fairly new to the market when my pieces were hung; could it be that the hooks have a shelf life and will undoubtedly fail given enough time? Are the hooks only designed to last a certain amount of time before drying up or losing adhesion? I couldn't imagine one of these things for 50 years (something a nail should have no problem with), what about 20 years or 10? If the product has a lifespan that it's the manufacturers duty to inform us of that estimated lifespan even if it is multiple decades.I still have the problem of the nearly impenetrable walls and am extremely tempted to continue using them with the caveat that replacement will be necessary after 2 - 3 years and with an additional hook to backup the first one should it fail (which was what happened with the 2nd of the 3 failures I had).I don't want to say the product is totally useless because it's not, I just think it's important people recognize the possible shelf life that the product may have.\n"

As much as it's not going to look as clean, I think I'm going to have to re-stick the hooks with regular command strips.The clips are also really hard to get un-clipped and get clipped back around the cords. I just left mine open because they didn't really need to be clipped, but keep it in mind.There isn't a lot of size guidance on what a \"large\" clip is in the photos. I have it holding a couple of HDMI cords, a power cord, and an RCA cord. It fits comfortably in the clip, not straining it but a little difficult to push the clips into the bundle to get them around the hooks.\n"

I purchased several 3M items at the same time including 3 of these Clear Caddy holders for my spices in Large and Medium sizes.  The actual containers fit perfect in my cabinets, unfortuately the clear adhesive strips they came with were awful.  The strips were clear but so thin, about as thin as double sided tape.  I figured since I planned to place some weight in them I decided to use all 4 strips for each caddy.  I installed a couple inside the cabinet door and another on a nearby wall and waited overnight before placing anything in them.  I wanted to give the adhesive time to stick.  The next day all seemed well. I tugged on the caddys and they seemed to have a strong hold. I placed 4 standard size \"plastic\" spice containers in the medium size ones and small nick-nack items in the large one.  I was happy, they held well.  An hour later I came back to load up more items in the cabinet, only to see all the caddy's had fallen down.  It was obvious the strips were not thick or strong enough to form a good enough seal between the caddy and cabinet or wall.In the end I had to go out and purchase more adhesive strips, an additional cost I was not happy about.  I decided on the thicker white foam ones because I knew they would have a better hold than the flimsy thin clear ones.  They held strong and 2 weeks later they show no signs of fall off.  So in my review I give the Caddy's a 5 star for functionality, but for the strips that came with them I'd give it a -3 stars.  -1 Star because 3M should have tested them better,  another -2 stars because I had to go out and buy additional replacement strips for each caddy.  I would recommend this produce, only if 3M adds additional strips to the product.  So in the end I guess my total for this review is 2 Stars.\n"

My issue (and 2-star rating) mainly is with the supplier that sold the packs to me (Amazon was the shipper, but I don't know what company they got these from). I reuse the hooks every year for my Halloween parties and always order tons of replacement strips. I order multiple packs that were supposed to be 64 stripes each. Several bags only had half of what they promised, while the other packs had the correct amount. But when I tried to return the product Amazon needed the entire shipment back. I needed the full packs and used them. I feel a bit ripped off.If you are looking for a review on the strips themselves, they are very good. Better than some of the generic brands I have used. Command gets my two thumbs up.Pros: The replacement strips do work well. Depending on the surface, it does not always come off easily or cleanly. I have had a few times it took the paint or part of the wall off. The strips adhere fast and easy. You don't always have the wait a long time to place an item on your hook. If you use for paper posters, you will have little issue with it staying up.Cons: They do not come cleanly off 100% of the time. I have had no problem with some strips, but on the same surface wall, one will take a chunk of it off. I can't explain it. Sometimes the strip breaks with the hook still on the wall. It really is sticky! Once down it's down. I have had some hooks stay on my wall for years. I go through about 480 replacement strips every Halloween (hanging fabric, decor, lights, weighed decor and signage).I would buy again, but maybe from an actual store if I buy multiple packs, so I know that I am getting what i am paying for.\n"

I loved this these hooks when I first discovered them; the walls in my home are practically made from concrete which makes putting nails in extremely difficult bordering on nearly impossible.I had several pieces hanging on my walls using different sized strips/hooks, all of which were hung around 5 to 6 years ago (maybe longer) over a period of approximately a year+. The product worked exactly as intended until suddenly a few months ago I hear a loud noise in another room and discover a framed piece had fallen from the wall. After all this time the adhesive backing completely failed completely, the back of the hook was no longer sticky at all.I assumed it was a freak accident and a few weeks to a month later the same exact thing happened (luckily this piece was hung using two hooks and only one failed). Still being a huge fan of the product I really didn't give the situation the critical eye that I should have. Skip ahead maybe another two months and this time something that had been hanging for years fell off the wall in front of my eyes because the adhesive suddenly failed. I really don't know what to make of the situation, there wasn't any extreme weather that might have caused a problem and all instructions were followed when installed.My best guess is that the adhesive material dried out over time. Reading other reviews I see cases where the hooks fail after weeks or even months but not years. This product was still fairly new to the market when my pieces were hung; could it be that the hooks have a shelf life and will undoubtedly fail given enough time? Are the hooks only designed to last a certain amount of time before drying up or losing adhesion? I couldn't imagine one of these things for 50 years (something a nail should have no problem with), what about 20 years or 10? If the product has a lifespan that it's the manufacturers duty to inform us of that estimated lifespan even if it is multiple decades.I still have the problem of the nearly impenetrable walls and am extremely tempted to continue using them with the caveat that replacement will be necessary after 2 - 3 years and with an additional hook to backup the first one should it fail (which was what happened with the 2nd of the 3 failures I had).I don't want to say the product is totally useless because it's not, I just think it's important people recognize the possible shelf life that the product may have.\n"

The actual containers fit perfect in my cabinets, unfortuately the clear adhesive strips they came with were awful.  The strips were clear but so thin, about as thin as double sided tape.  I figured since I planned to place some weight in them I decided to use all 4 strips for each caddy.  I installed a couple inside the cabinet door and another on a nearby wall and waited overnight before placing anything in them.  I wanted to give the adhesive time to stick.  The next day all seemed well. I tugged on the caddys and they seemed to have a strong hold. I placed 4 standard size \"plastic\" spice containers in the medium size ones and small nick-nack items in the large one.  I was happy, they held well.  An hour later I came back to load up more items in the cabinet, only to see all the caddy's had fallen down.  It was obvious the strips were not thick or strong enough to form a good enough seal between the caddy and cabinet or wall.In the end I had to go out and purchase more adhesive strips, an additional cost I was not happy about.  I decided on the thicker white foam ones because I knew they would have a better hold than the flimsy thin clear ones.  They held strong and 2 weeks later they show no signs of fall off.  So in my review I give the Caddy's a 5 star for functionality, but for the strips that came with them I'd give it a -3 stars.  -1 Star because 3M should have tested them better,  another -2 stars because I had to go out and buy additional replacement strips for each caddy.  I would recommend this produce, only if 3M adds additional strips to the product.  So in the end I guess my total for this review is 2 Stars.\n"

My issue (and 2-star rating) mainly is with the supplier that sold the packs to me (Amazon was the shipper, but I don't know what company they got these from). I reuse the hooks every year for my Halloween parties and always order tons of replacement strips. I order multiple packs that were supposed to be 64 stripes each. Several bags only had half of what they promised, while the other packs had the correct amount. But when I tried to return the product Amazon needed the entire shipment back. I needed the full packs and used them. I feel a bit ripped off.If you are looking for a review on the strips themselves, they are very good. Better than some of the generic brands I have used. Command gets my two thumbs up.Pros: The replacement strips do work well. Depending on the surface, it does not always come off easily or cleanly. I have had a few times it took the paint or part of the wall off. The strips adhere fast and easy. You don't always have the wait a long time to place an item on your hook. If you use for paper posters, you will have little issue with it staying up.Cons: They do not come cleanly off 100% of the time. I have had no problem with some strips, but on the same surface wall, one will take a chunk of it off. I can't explain it. Sometimes the strip breaks with the hook still on the wall. It really is sticky! Once down it's down. I have had some hooks stay on my wall for years. I go through about 480 replacement strips every Halloween (hanging fabric, decor, lights, weighed decor and signage).I would buy again, but maybe from an actual store if I buy multiple packs, so I know that I am getting what i am paying for.\n"

My refrigerator is a Kenmore (actually a Whirlpool) side by side 106.53332300 (purchased back in 2003). I was concerned about reviews regarding this filter not working so I wrote to the company and I will include their response to me in my review. I've attached a photo of what the manufacturer info says on my filter package and as you will see from the response from Whirlpool, the filters made by 3M may be an issue for older refrigerators.--------------------------Thank you for contacting Whirlpool Consumer Direct Sales through our website.I am happy to assist you with your water filter questions.You are correct. Your replacement water filter is EDR5RXD1. That being said, we have noticed that older model refrigerators in the 8-10 year old range or older have had some issues with one of our newer filter. We do have two manufactures for this filter and with these models we have noticed that one will work and the other will be very difficult to install. It is possible but very difficult. Our engineers are working on a solution to this issue.If you order directly from us, our warehouse will ship what they have in stock and we have no control over which one they ship. If you are purchasing your filter at the store you can differentiate which one you are purchasing. On the bottom left side of the box you will see where it says \"manufactured for Whirlpool\" then it will say by.. and it will either say Kemflo or 3M for the manufacturer. If you look at the old filter you have been using you will either see it is flat at the top or has cut out notches in the top. One of these two filters will match the one that you have been using. I believe it is the one made by Kemflo that is working with the older models.We do have a 30 day return policy and a 90 day warranty so if you do order by phone and get one that doesn't work we would replace it for you. As of right now we just have no way to know which one the warehouse will be shipping. We hope to have a better solution for you soon. I do apologize for the inconvenience.Thank you for your email. Have a great day.If you have any additional questions or concerns, you may also reach our retail parts department at 1-800-901-2042 and choose the water filters option. Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m.to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.You are a valued Whirlpool customer and we appreciate your support of the Whirlpool Brand. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to assist you today. Have a good day!Sincerely,Billie P.Whirlpool Consumer Direct Sales-------------------------------------The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I find it very upsetting that there is this manufacturing issue where if you order the filter on any online source even through Whirlpool you can't know if it will fit until you get it!. With the original filter I never had to worry about that because it always worked. I sincerely hope Whirlpool will take this seriously and solve this engineering issue soon.----------------------------------------New Update, The filter I got from Amazon was the one made in Mexico. Although I was able to install it (it had a rounded top), my refrigerator had small water leaks at the dispenser for the 6 months that it was installed. It was minor or I would have changed the filter sooner but still annoying considering it is supposed to be the correct filter. Now I have the correct filter that I had to spend more money to purchase in town, made by Kemflo that has the notches on top and fits correctly. I downgraded my review to 2 stars because of the problem with having 2 manufacturers that make this same filter different causing fit and use issues.Basically, you will be taking your chances buying this filter online because you won't know which one you will get..\n"

So I poured the same water through the filter again, and wiped the leftover specs from my cup, while it filtered. When I poured it again, I saw the black specs again!... Even after filtering it a 3rd time, I still saw specs. Less than the first time, but still unnerving.I decided to compare, and see if it's stuff from the unfiltered water, getting through. So I poured a cup of straight tap, and THAT was actually CLEAR. I don't know if during the filtration process, the metals clump together, and THAT'S what I see as specs. But either way, I think it's reasonable to expect whatever it is, to not get through, and for your water to be clear, especially after multiple filtrations.

I had one of these years ago and the plastic was thicker and sustained several drops from the counter over a couple years' time.  Whether the company has decided to cheap out and make the plastic thinner and/or brittle and more likely to break/crack in that time, I don't know, but I had this pitcher less than a month before the top fell off the counter while I was washing the base and just cracked from top to bottom of the top portion.  And I have marmoleum now, which is kinder to glass and plastic drops than the ceramic tile I had then. I now use the bottom portion to water my potted plants.

Metal ones are lots more expensive, but you'll only have to buy one.  Nice because you can fill refillable bottles and not buy all those plastic individual bottles.  You may get the purchase price back in a year, depending on how much water you buy. No, I don't have any stock in any water filters.  I'm just irritated.On another note, and separate from my dissatisfaction and anger with the Brita company: If you live in the PNW and you have any concerns about The Big One, the earthquake that might soon, essentially, separate everyone west of I-5 from the rest of the country and from utilities, like tap water, for a  month or two, a more effective, larger water filter for stream and rainwater might be a good idea anyway.

Of course, as has become typical of the produce of this age, that iteration is not to our benefit, but to theirs. The driving principle behind this product is clearly designed obsolescence. Specifically, the lid that goes on top is only held on by friction between a thin layer of plastic on the lid and the pitcher body itself. You have to more or less bend that thin plastic liner to force/pop the lid on and off of the pitcher to refill it. Not only is this actually considerably difficult relative to what it should be for a task you have to do so often (fill up your water pitcher...), but it's obvious that it will eventually lead to material fatigue of the lid. The lid will break and lose its stay attached of its own accord and needlessly leave you with yet another useless hunk of plastic to throw into the sea.I find it particularly insulting that a Brita was not sufficiently pleased with the legitimate selling of replacement filters, but also felt the need to design their products not last any meaningful amount of time. When this breaks, or when the filter expires, I'll replace it with some other brand, not that I have much hope anything else will be much better.\n"

I can assure you that I never dropped this thing neither do I handle it roughly, but this pitcher seems so brittle that it just couldn't hold the weight of 10 cups of water as publicized and cracked on its own. 10 cups is really not it's cup of tea, trust me.I already contact the seller about the issue on 25th day, I would be more happy if I get money back instead of a replacement since I don't want to use it again and then it breaks then I ask for a replacement again.

Instead of using a Pitcher filter and not wanting to risk my dishes, I purchased this filter - here is where the problem is.The component which physically attaches the sink to your Brita filter has the potential to whittle down and is unreliable. That is to say, if it is of poor quality then the water will erode it and will cause the Brita filter itself to be attached to the component (via the circular lock you can see on the product image) while the component dislodges from the sink partially and causes water to leak out in the dislodged area. This at first occurred very briefly, maybe once every 3 weeks. Now, it has come the point where the component itself will not even withstand even a few hours before starting to leak again, and for me the customer this means needing to either physically remove the component from the Brita filter and try to recrew it to the sink, or use another tool. All in all, buyer please be aware, these products have immensely frustrating unreliability and I am now unable to receive any of my money back that I spent on this.\n"

I wanted to put things back up on the wall so there were no holes when I took them down.We moved to our new house in July 2019.  I used Command Strips on almost everything that went on the wall except for the very heaviest things.  My walls have a texture but it is mostly flat so I did my best to make sure the Strips were placed where they would have a flat surface.  I also wiped down the walls with alcohol per the instructions.  3M says they are only for use on flat surfaces.  Good grief!  Where does any house have a completely flat surface other than on cabinets?Anyway, I overestimated the weight of everything and used bigger Command Strips and put a Strip on every corner of everything, except for the hooks.  In October 2020 my things began falling off the walls.  I wrote to 3M and, basically, it was my fault for using them on textured walls.  I proceeded to screw and nail up my wall decor.  However, I had a temporary, light-weight decoration to hang so I peeled a Command Strip and found it had no more adhesive whatsoever!  I pulled out a different size and it was the same thing!  I started checking them all and most of them had no more adhesive!  No wonder my things were falling!There's no expiration date on them so should they poop out like that?  I don't think so.  I wrote back to 3M saying I no longer wanted to use their product and wanted to send everything I had left to them so they could send me a refund.

I\u2019ve had to use tweezers and still sometimes a strip won\u2019t be usable because the backing is just too stuck to the glue.The other major problem is I\u2019ve had these rip paint and sometimes drywall paper right off the wall when they\u2019re removed, no matter how carefully it\u2019s done. This wasn\u2019t an issue when I used these 5 or more years ago. Now I\u2019d rather have nail holes in my wall than paint and drywall paper ripped off since nail holes are easier to fix.\n"

The outdoor temperature has varied between about 65 - 90 degrees F, typical summertime conditions in my area. There has been no rain or heavy winds since I first attached the hooks. One  has held as intended, but the other fell off on its own after being up about a week. And when I used the two other replacement adhesive strips to reattach the fallen hook (the two hooks come with a set of four strips), again installing exactly according to instructions, after I tried to put back the light, the same hook immediately fell off two more times shortly after re-installing the light, also once taking part of the paint with it. So three of the four glue strips included in the package have failed completely and proven totally defective. The other hook has stayed on, holding the light on its own but of course improperly aligned because it is imbalanced by being supported by only one hook.This is supposed to be a brand-name adhesive strip with the 3M logo displayed, but apparently the quality control is totally abysmal. The hooks themselves are fine and sturdy, but without proper adhesion they are just so much junk plastic. And apparently you cannot simply buy replacement strips, you have to buy an entire new set of hooks. I guess I will have to buy some other producer's double sided tape to see if that works, and never consider any 3M product again.

I wanted to put things back up on the wall so there were no holes when I took them down.We moved to our new house in July 2019.  I used Command Strips on almost everything that went on the wall except for the very heaviest things.  My walls have a texture but it is mostly flat so I did my best to make sure the Strips were placed where they would have a flat surface.  I also wiped down the walls with alcohol per the instructions.  3M says they are only for use on flat surfaces.  Good grief!  Where does any house have a completely flat surface other than on cabinets?Anyway, I overestimated the weight of everything and used bigger Command Strips and put a Strip on every corner of everything, except for the hooks.  In October 2020 my things began falling off the walls.  I wrote to 3M and, basically, it was my fault for using them on textured walls.  I proceeded to screw and nail up my wall decor.  However, I had a temporary, light-weight decoration to hang so I peeled a Command Strip and found it had no more adhesive whatsoever!  I pulled out a different size and it was the same thing!  I started checking them all and most of them had no more adhesive!  No wonder my things were falling!There's no expiration date on them so should they poop out like that?  I don't think so.

They're so high and clear you can't see them so I just taped them off when we painted. They worked fantastic! I'm so tired of someone making a quality useful product only to have them cut corners and make them horrible once millions of pieces are being sold. Beware if you don't want something ruined by crashing to the ground. I do remove the big ones. to save hundreds of dollars worth of crystal and glass ornaments and silks from being destroyed, I'm using actual hardware this year.

Because all the pictures started to fall (in different rooms) during a relatively short period of time, I'm thinking it was either due to a change in humidity affecting the adhesive (it has been 60% recently, compared to 35%-ish normally here in Central Texas), or perhaps changes in weather have caused my house to shift, although that seems less likely.I'm extremely disappointed because I really thought these strips were the perfect solution to hanging pictures until my pictures started to fall off.\n"

Update:  Only a few hours after I wrote my first review, I attempted to make a small adjustment to the rope lights I hung on these clips.  I barely opened the hook on the clip, and it broke off.  I do NOT recommend these clips.  POOR QUALITY.  My first review:  I used the clips to hold up strings of rope lights around smooth metal window frames, interior, no direct sunlight.  I followed the directions exactly for surface prep and attaching.  Outside weather was dry, and about 72 degrees.  4 of the adhesive clips didn't stick to the window frames at all.  The adhesive strips felt sticky to the touch, but wouldn't stick.  I put new adhesive strips on, and put them in the exact same locations - adhered fine this time (wasted 4 adhesive strips).  3 of the 'hooks' on the clips snapped off while I was inserting the rope lights.  I didn't overstretch the hooks at all, but the plastic hooks were weak and snapped.  Good idea for the design, but a disappointing.  I expect better quality for the money, especially 3M products.

When we bought the fridge, and learned it had a water filter, I thought that's nice, but had no idea that MayTag itself would not supply filters for their own products.  Instead, we're forced to search and research for someone that does sell replacement filters.  What we've learned is that this is a captured market and the manufacturers are gouging customers.  After you've spent a couple thousand on a new fridge that uses a water filter, you'll now need to spend $45+ every few months for filters, forever.  Anyhow, the morning after installing this overpriced junk, I opened the fridge and water just poured out everywhere.  It causes so much back pressure the connector and seals cannot handle it and the front shield that covers the filter fills up with water in a few minutes and then continues to flow and spill, continuously.  Lesson learned.  If you can find them, there are $18 versions of this filter that float around Amazon ever so often and they work perfectly.  A more sensibly priced and working version is at \"Compatible with Filter 2 Refrigerator Water Filter W10413645A W10413645 Kenmore 9082 (1-Pack)Sold by: apluschoice\"\n"

I pushed very hard on it, and it simply will not snap in. To make sure I was doing it right, I put the old filter back in, and that one snapped right in, no problem. The new white filter looks the same as the old blue filter with some minor differences that were pointed out by other reviewers. It looks like those minor differences are keeping this filter from working properly.I called the Whirlpool help line, and after 15 minutes on hold I finally connected to a customer support agent, who talked me through the installation procedure. It was the same procedure I was already doing, so I was not doing it incorrectly before. The filter would not snap in. He thought that it might be the wrong filter, but I have triple checked everything. I have the correct filter model for my fridge.The service agent thought that there might be something wrong with this filter since I did not buy it from Whirlpool. He told me to order one from them and it will fit. I placed the order, but I have not received it yet, so I cannot report on whether or not a filter from Whirlpool (actually, Every Drop) will fit better than the one sold by Amazon. I will update this if/when I receive the new filter and try it out.BTW, the new filter cannot be returned to Whirlpool for a refund if I open the packaging. Without opening the packaging, I will not be able to tell if the new filter will snap in to place or not. So there really is no return policy.  I am gambling my own 50 bucks on their hunch that the same filter from Whirlpool will fit while this one will not.The bottom line on this is that this filter does not fit in the Maytag MSD2559XEM refrigerator. Caveat.UPDATE:I ordered a filter directly from Whirlpool as recommended by their help line. The cost was $49.99 plus sales tax. I received the filter in about a week.The packaging of both the Whirlpool filter and the Amazon filter are identical, and the part numbers on the packaging, EDR3RXD1, are identical. The filters themselves are NOT identical. When placed side by side, you can see that on the Amazon filter, the body of the filter flares out as it goes into the end cap. On the filter from Whirlpool, the body flares out only a tiny bit, and meets the end cap mostly at a 90 degree angle. Other than that, they look identical. But that small difference seems to be key. The old blue PUR filter also does not flare out where the body goes into the end cap.The first time I tried to put the Whirlpool filter into the fridge, it did not snap in. However, I gave it one more try and replaced the old one to see exactly how much force is needed to get it to snap in. Even with the old filter, I had to give it one last nudge in order to get it to snap in, so I tried that on the Whirlpool filter, and it worked. So, the Whirlpool filter DOES fit, and the Amazon filter DOES NOT fit. I did not try to remove the new filter to see if it will come out. That would be tempting fate a bit too much.The bottom line is that there are at least two versions of this filter out there. One fits and the other does not, even though they carry the same part number. Caveat Emptor when buying third party filters.I ran water through the filter until it stopped spitting air (about two gallons). The water smells and tastes OK. I cannot detect any of the off odors or tastes that other reviewers have reported. The flow is fine. It will take a while to see how long the filter lasts.I am leaving this rating at one star because I am reviewing the filter that I bought from Amazon, not the filter that I bought from Whirlpool. They claim to be the same filter, but they are not. Because of the misrepresentation of the Amazon filter, I would remove my one star and give it a zero if I could. Caveat Emptor.\n"
