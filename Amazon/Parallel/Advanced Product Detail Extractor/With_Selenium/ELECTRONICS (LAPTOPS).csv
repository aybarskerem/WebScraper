  Exceeded my expectations! Some of the reviews had me a bit nervous but I can‚Äôt tell you how happy I am! The laptop is on almost brand new condition! Only 1 TINY nick on the front (you can‚Äôt see it unless your looking) and it was perfectly ready for me to set up my account! No issues or problems! It comes in a box perfectly protected and has the charger to go with as wellüëçüèº So happy with it! Thank you!

  All in all, the laptop works great! It runs fast, it‚Äôs clean, and it‚Äôs perfect for what I needed it. The one disappointment I have it they claimed this product as a catagory A which means like new. When it arrived, the screen had two scratch marks on it that was discolored from the rest of the screen. I would understand like new for any other part to have a scratch, but the screen is a big deal and it should have mentioned that in the details.

  I was so excited because this laptop came in perfect condition. But when I tried to change the unsername to my name it wouldn‚Äôt work. 3 calls to Apple later, and I find out this computer is owned by a school that can remotely access my laptop at any time. Meaning, if they wanted to they could shut down and erase my laptop. Amazon gave me a full refund but I am very sad and disappointed

  This MacBook Air is amazing!  I had been previously using a 2007 MacBook Air and it was time to upgrade.  I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it.

  When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a ‚Äúlow battery‚Äù notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It‚Äôs hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I‚Äôve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it‚Äôs disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn‚Äôt meet my standards of what ‚Äúcertified refurbished‚Äù means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time.

  It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn‚Äôt let me go foward.  Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn‚Äôt let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that‚Äôs already 3 strikes. No thanks.

  Good quality, arrived early. As-new condition. Easy to install from my old machine via time machine backup. The old one was a 2010, now we are good for another 5-7 years.Thanks

  Do not waste your money or your time and energy. Please! I felt like everyone else who gave this a chance. I was nervous buying a refurbished computer, but this site had pretty good reviews overall. I was definitely wrong. The laptop shipped quick, but as soon as I pulled it out of the box- it wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I tried everything, eventually the following day I brought it to the Apple store to just make sure it wasn‚Äôt something as easy as the charger not working. NOPE! That‚Äôs when they were able to tell me the laptop had this weird covering on the bottom of it- which covered all the computers info. Turns out, it came from a school. They said it was definitely sketchy and had a hardware issue. I sent it back- it‚Äôs taken almost 2 weeks since I sent it out to get my refund- they issued it today, but it still says it would take 3-5 days to get in my account. What a freaking headache and waste!!

  I was expecting a computer with scratches and obvious wear, but there were only two scuffs on the side of the computer which are barely noticeable and well-hidden with a plastic hard-case protector. The computer is rather small and light-weight. Think: iPad Pro with an attached keyboard.The battery life is pretty good for this kind of computer, but that‚Äôs just coming from a college student who only uses it to write essays and browse the internet; I don‚Äôt use it for more professional tasks like video-editing . Someone previously said the screen is yellowish but that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. All in all, it‚Äôs a really good, functional computer for the price. I‚Äôll change my review if I encounter problems.

  I was nervous about buying a refurbished Mac after reading so many negative reviews, but I'm glad I did!  This is a great computer, updated with the latest OS and from early 2015.  For me, this is great for what I need it for.  I purchased the additional warranty just incase.  So far, I'm happy with my purchase!  My best advice is to read the seller's feedback page before buying.

  I ordered this Mac Book Air, and reading from the description, I was thinking it would be wonderful. It was a good price, and I'm very familiar with Mac Books. I ordered this sometime in July, and it has worked perfectly. I decorated the outside with some of my favorite stickers, and I had all my information on there. It was my favorite thing I bought.""Oh, well why did you give it one star?"" you're probably wondering. Well friend, you see, this product came without 2 essential parts on the backside of the keyboard. When December came, my keyboard stopped responding to the computer completely. I called Apple about the issue, and what they told me over phone did not work. I had to visit Apple in person, so they could look at it. I was there for hours, and nothing got solved. So I then visited a Professional Computer-Repairman, and when he took apart the backside of the keyboard, he saw nothing wrong, until he looked deeper. He found that I was missing 2 essential parts to my laptop. He tried ordering these parts from China, but they have not responded.I have tried contacting Amazon many times, and they're not willing to help me out since my computer was purchased months ago, so it passed the 90 day rule. I feel as though this special situation should grant me a refund. But nope. Next time I order a laptop I will go to a Repair shop, have them take it apart, and see if anything is wrong. If there is, at least I can send it back within 90 days :).Ohhhh wait, I can't order a new laptop! I'm a poor college student and only had enough money for a laptop when I originally bought this one. And it was a complete dud! Can't wait to spend the rest of my college days in a computer lab. I don't think I'll ever buy from Amazon again. I'm sorry.

  Okay wow! I am so pleasantly surprised and so glad I took a chance. Even if I received a faulty one, I could just exchange for another but based off of negative reviews I was still a little nervous. This laptop is nearly perfect! Hardly any scratches, none that are even noticeable unless you‚Äôre looking for them. Keys work perfect, battery power seems great so far. Seems like a brand new laptop for a fraction of the price. Win, win

  I was very concerned about buying a refurbished item from Amazon, but after received the MacBook Air yesterday I have changed my mind. First of all let me tell you the item is in great condition, small scuff and dins in the back due to the normal use, display in excellent condition as Keyboard and trackpad. Battery hold the charge for 4 hours, better than expected and described on apple website. I was able to upgrade to IOS Mojave last night without any problem. I've bought a Mosiso plastic hard cover with Keyboard cover for $13 as you can see in picture. In conclusion, despite some bad reviews I can say I got an amazing Macbook for a very good price, that means an excellent deal was made, so I recommended 100% and you can return it anyway if you are not satisfied. Happy customer

  Definitely used, a lot of dents and scratches. Also not clean and had a lot of finger prints/sticky stuff on the outside. The power cord needs to be replaced due to it ""turtlenecking"" quite badly.But the computer seems to work just fine.

  Item arrived in blank discreet packaging and was well packaged and well protected.  The physical appearance and condition of this MacBook was as close to new as could be and the performance the same.  There was not one scuff mark, scratch, smudge, or dent whatsoever.  There were two factors that gave away that it was refurbished--battery life doesn't seem to last as long as it should which at this point is not a huge deal, but within 6 mos to a year, may become problematic and require a battery replacement.  This isn't a huge deal for me because my husband and I own an iPhone/laptop repair shop and if need be, can perform the replacement of the battery fairly easily and inexpensively.  The second is that if you look really closely, it appears possibly that the screen had been replaced due to the rubber around the outside of the screen being slightly out of position and when you open it up, sometimes there is a lot of play and is a tad bit loose only at certain angles, which might actually be normal for MacBook Air laptops.  This is my first MacBook so I don't know much about what a brand new one would perform like but far as I am concerned, this was a 100% success and I couldn't be happier with it! I would highly recommend this product by this JemJem Renewed seller to anyone looking to purchase a Next-To-New as possible refurbished MacBook Air or Mac product but not willing to pay retail or Brand New price for it.  It is a great bargain and I would definitely purchase it again from there-in fact, I probably will never purchase a brand new Mac product if I can get the same item or similar item for a fraction of the price and basically same condition.

  Best equipment I've ever purchased.  MacBooks are very expensive and I cannot afford a brand new one.  I am beyond happy!  the response time on this refurbished macbook air is so much faster than my HP laptop.  I don't think I'm ever going back to a windows based platform

  I was pretty nervous buying a used computer made 5 years ago but it works great!  I am not technology oriented and it took a few trips to apple store, (live close to one thank goodness) to get the latest version of software on it but I am absolutely delighted with this purchase.  I wanted my brother to have the twin to mine so I could help him learn how to use it.  We live 1000 miles apart and he has no apple store!  Also, it looks much better than mine but I drop mine several times a week!  This is my first refurbished purchase but will not be my last.

  I first purchased another Mac Pro from another seller because it was slightly more expensive and so thought it would be better quality.  I received it and was very disappointed.  Not only did it have scratches and dents....it did not work.  After 3 attempts to load our programs,  the Mac would delete them within the hour.  I had to send it back.  I then ordered this Mac. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  There was only 1 small scratch which you could only see if you were looking for it.  We had purchased a cover for the computer and it looked great!  Not only that but the computer is in great working order.  After a week of having it, we have had no issues.  Do not be discouraged by the price or other comments.....we received a great product:)

  Two ""Like New"" lap tops sent and two returned. These guys just can't seem to get it right. The 1st unit was dog-eared from a serious drop and the hinge was wobbling. The 2nd unit was sans dog-ears anyway,  but guess what? The monitor hinge was flopping around bad as the 1st unit and the monitor would hardly stay up. I asked a Mac tech if that was normal and he said, emphatically, it WAS NOT. He said that a monitor hinge ought to be drum tight, that something was broken inside the hinge, and that no decent refurbisher could fail to see it.After two bum ""refurbished"" laptops in a row I can only assume that somebody out there busts the hinges before the units are sent as some kind of joke,  or more likely hopes to pass this junk off as ""Like New"".Well, it ain't.

  I haven't used a Mac since 2002, but so far I'm loving this one. It's very small and light, turns on fairly quickly, and is easy to use. Since it's refurbished I was expecting it to have some scratches and dents, but I only found one small dent in the corner and no scratches. Everything appears to be working great! I'll update this review if that changes; let's hope it doesn't.

  The laptop works well, no complaints there whatsoever;  but the physical shape is surprising.  It looks like it's been through a war.  Dents on several parts of it, scratches, pin pricks.

  The computer worked ok, but it arrived dirty and the screen was lightly damaged. I returned the item and decided it was better to invest a little bit more and buy a new laptop of the same kind but new of course, more recent, in perfect condition and with the mac warranty.Maybe this is a good option if you really want to save 200 or 250 dlls and you don't care about details like bruises and little damages on your computer.

  This ordered was fulfilled by Southwest Electronics. The computer was out of the box for less than two months before it failed. Completely. Blank screen. Totally unusable. We brought it to Apple for a diagnostic and were told that it would cost $500 to fix the motherboard and the storage--almost the price we paid for the item. It was advertised as refurbished, but clearly it was not. This was a fraudulent representation by Southwest Electronics. Buyers should beware.

  ¬†First I will say if I could rate with no stars I would. I purchased the computer back in November without reading the reviews ( my biggest mistake). It worked fine for maybe a month or two and then one day just stopped working. By the looks of the reviews I‚Äôm not the only one. Do not buy. Not worth it.

  Was very iffy about buying refurbished but it‚Äôs honestly like new! There are a couple of LITTLE scratches but nothing noticeable! Compared to my friends MacBook Air that she paid 1100$ for and they are the absolute same. Best $500 I‚Äôve ever spent. & the company is AWESOME! The charger didn‚Äôt work as soon as I got it & I emailed them. Within an hour I had an email from them and they were sending me a new charger, thankful my friend had her charger that I used until I received mine but the battery last like 2-3 days so it wasn‚Äôt that bad.

  Wow! Bought this from TECHarvard and was claimed to be Certified Refurbished, which according to the Amazon description should show limited to no signs of wear.  Well the device that I received not only was pretty scratched on the bottom, had a huge ding on the corner of the top cover, but the keyboard showed more signs of wear than the MacBook that I've had for 5 years(Space bar was completely warped).  Definitely does not resemble a new device in any way shape or form.  If they are selling used devices, call them used and mark the price down accordingly.  This is definitely going back.

  Overall the laptop is nice. A couple of marks on the outside but works relatively well. There was an issue with the battery that originally came with it. It would shut off around 65% battery life. I asked the seller for a replacement battery, which they gave to me free of charge. However, the replacement battery is not originally an Apple battery and instead a knock off. This issue prompted it to restart randomly no matter what the battery life was at. I‚Äôm putting the original battery back in and having Apple replace it with the appropriate battery for an additional fee. I got what a paid for and I won‚Äôt make the mistake of buying a refurbished Apple product from anywhere other than the Apple store again.

  Seller: IT5050Wowie! My son wanted an Apple Computer for Christmas and I was not about to spend $1000+ on a laptop for a 11-year-old boy. But a refurbished MacBook was definitely priced more appropriate for him. This computer is AMAZING people!!! Looks so clean and new. Only a couple faint scratches on the bottom, the keyboard looks like it was hardly touched, screen is clear and no burn marks in it, plus the battery is great. The seller was so awesome to get me this gift in time for Christmas, they are quick to respond to emails and followed up to make sure it was delivered afterward. (seriously, the nicest people!) I had purchased another renewed MacBook from another seller, and their level of quality wasn‚Äôt as good, by far. I wish I could pre-select a quality grade for the laptop (excellent, good, fair, etc.), so it is a little scary just leaving it up to the unknown. I work in the retail business and I like to applaud small companies who sell quality products. Do yourself a favor and go here, they gave me a laptop that is stellar and eased my worries about a refurbished laptop. It really looks so good and is operating perfectly. This is such a smarter way to buy a computer, especially for kids, or if you like to have the pricier brands without spending the high price. ‚Äì Happy Mommy!

  Ok so certified refurbished has usually worked great for me and the products are normally in near new or new condition. The box this computer came in says NEW however when I opened it I immediately noticed visible damage to the MacBook case. Not too bad, a couple scratches and a dent. I could have lived with that but when I opened it up the first thing that caught my attention is a 2.5 inch scratch on the screen. That I can't live with, not for this price. To top it off it was dirty, like sand or dirt all over the keyboard... If I would have known it would be in this condition I would not have ordered it.

  I am so disappointed! My husband has wanted a MacBook Air for years, got this machine that is supposed to be refurbished ‚Äúlike new‚Äù and you can see what he opened up on Christmas in the pictures included in this review. The product was dented and scratched on the left back corner of the lid, and it loads up with a question mark on the screen. I assume that means it can‚Äôt read any operating system, so much for OS X Mavericks. He was so excited when he opened his present, only to be deeply disappointed when getting it out and turning it on. Going through the ‚Äúprocess‚Äù to get it replaced but it‚Äôs not as easy as you think! Avoid the disappointment and buy elsewhere!!!

  I've wanted a macbook for the past 3 years. So when I found this one, I was excited! But, I was honestly terrified based on the reviews. Good to bad review ratio was like 2:10. With that said, i'll talk about my experience so far. I selected next day shipping, but being that I ordered on a Friday, I received it today. I was supposed to get it around 3PM, but it arrived at 12:16PM. My grandma was there to sign for it. When I got home from school, I immediately opened the box. It came in a brown box. I saw the charger first. It is a certified apple charger. I then saw the macbook and it was securely wrapped and in the bottom of the box. I got it out of the plastic and noticed a single scratch. ONE. UNO. I opened it up and no keys were missing, nor was there any dirt or scratches on the screen. This laptop was SO CLEAN! I started it up and panicked because it was taking a bit, but then I realized it was dead. I plugged it in and it turned on right away. I waited for the apple logo to disappear and VOILA! It was like a brand-new computer. I set up everything from the start. It stays charged, Im currently updating it, and I am so pleased.Yes, this was a hit or miss, but I would definitely say worth it. If it's crappy, then there's a 90 day return policy, and refund.I also already bought a case, a mouse and keyboard cover!

  VERY disappointed.  The computer runs fine, but the display hinge is weak and the display flops over if adjusted to much more than 90 degrees from the keyboard.  Apparently, these MacBooks are very susceptible to this problem, and fixing the problem requires major surgery / return to factory.  You would think this problem would be fixed in the ""refurbish"" process.  Going to return.

  The description for the product states, ""This Certified Refurbished product is tested and certified by the manufacturer or by a third-party refurbisher to look and work like new, with limited to no signs of wear.""  What we received had been clearly dropped multiple times.  The corners no longer lined up with one being completely crushed.  The damage was obvious and should have been caught by the ""inspector"" before it passed inspection.  Now we need to return it and hope for the best with the next one.

  It's great! From the reviews i've read, I thought there was a chance i'd end up with a terrible looking or even barely functional laptop, but everything is working wonderfully and the laptop looks fine, too. Mine's got some small scratches and indents on the top and some slightly bigger scratches on the bottom, but the keyboard area is fine, the trackpad is also fine and the screen seems to have some microscopic scratches that you can only see if the backlight is completely off. Totally worth the price difference!

  I was incredibly disappointed with my purchase. The MacBook Air that was sent to me looked like it has been on a construction site and thrown around for fun. There were significant dents and scratches all over the laptop, including very visible screen defects. To top it all off, there was a piece of black electrical tape holding part of it together. I understand I didn't purchase a brand-new product, however, the laptop sent to me far exceeded the boundaries for what should be considered a used product, even at the lowest standards. I think I'll bite the bullet and spend the extra $400 to purchase something new and not held together by electrical tape.

  I've always had good luck going with refurbs in the past, but evidently this one wasn't as ""certified"" as the description suggested. The item looked fine, but was clearly not a USA market release as the split Asian/English keyboard characters proved. That I could have lived with, but the battery had an intermittent fault in that it would report one level, but randomly/intermittently shut down due to low battery regardless of the level reported.

  I've never been a Mac fan, and I never would have bought this, but my daughter's school ""highly recommended"" a Mac, implying that a Windows PC or Chromebook would be inadequate.  Not willing to spend $1200 on a laptop for a 13 year old, I bought this refurbished unit at $575.  Still more than a brand new PC or top of the line Chromebook.  Now, less than 6 months after buying, but well past the 90 day warranty, it won't charge.  The repair is likely to cost more than a typical  Chromebook or adequate PC, and as it turns out, either one of those would be just fine at my daughter's school.  Never again!

  When I got my Apple MacAir, it worked as expected. I run a online business, very basic things on the computer. They have a 90 day warranty on this product but my problems started happening a month and a half after the warranty ended. First, my built in sound went out. I called Apple and they trouble shooter everything over the phone. Nothing worked. I ended up getting a Bluetooth speaker which worked so I dealt with the problem. My computer started to run run slow weeks after, the system thought it was over heating and in the same breathe, the system stopped holding charge. Once I plugged out the laptop, my system died!!!I finally went to Apple store about another month and change later because it unbareable to do anything on the system. They ran a test and my computer failed all test that were ran. They said that this shouldn‚Äôt have happened on the timeline that I had the computer.Long story short, I informed this 3rd party seller and they didn‚Äôt attempt to help at all because of their policy of 90 days. I was better off spending a few dollars more and going through Amazon products sold by Amazon, which the warranty is 365 days (1 yr warranty).I contacted Amazon again who have been so helpful and understanding of the situation but is very limited, I don‚Äôt have a back up computer at the moment and operating my business on my phone temporarily still waiting for assistance thru this 3rd party. I don‚Äôt stand behind their quality of product at this point and did not offer a replacement, like they knew their refurbished products wouldn‚Äôt last.

  ¬†UPDATE: I've now owned this machine for over a year and it still is a perfect machine! Great purchase for the price!This product came practically brand new. The only thing wrong with the machine was the tiny cosmetic scuffs on the bottom side that are shown in one picture. Those were the only marks on the machine. The only problem I had with the machine was when I attempted to update the OS from Sierra to Mojave. As soon as I got it I went to update the OS just because I preferred Mojave. In this process I got the error message that there was not enough storage even though it came factory reset. After a call to apple tech support they walked me through reformatting the hard drive and within a couple of hours I had the latest update on the MacBook. However, I didn‚Äôt count off in the rating for this because the machine came running great and I personally just wanted to update the machine.

  It's always a little nerve wracking buying anything that is fairly costly, and used. I did my research, read and re-read the reviews, and figured that I'd give it a shot. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.The MacBook Air 13.3 came in great condition. It came in a sturdy package. The screen was clean, no marks or scratches. There were some very minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop, but nothing that I'd complain about. The hard drive was clean; no random files that belonged to the previous user. The battery appears to be fine. I was able to set the user/password without any problems. It came with an Apple charger, nice! I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again.

  I had a MacBook Pro that died recently on me. I took it to get repaired and learned that with it's age and needing interior hardware, I would be better off purchasing a new laptop completely. I didn't really need a MacBook anymore as I have a laptop supplied from work along with an iPad. But when I began looking for a Windows laptop, I found this refurbished MacBook and decided to take a chance based on great reviews! I have not been disappointed at all!!! Works great, fair battery life, and very durable. There is only one small ding on the laptop that has zero to do with functionality and only I have seen it so far. Thanks for a great product!!

  I will be honest I was super nervous buying a refurbished Apple, but to my surprise it looks & works like it‚Äôs brand new. CTS Warehouse you definitely have a customer for life.

  Very disappointed. It was advertised as ‚Äòlike new‚Äô condition with minimal to no signs of wear. The computer works fine but I open the box and two of the corners of the laptop are smashed in, there are smalls white hairs and crumbs around the edges of the screen and there‚Äôs bits of grime all over the computer that I could scrape off with my finger nail. Disgusting! I paid WAY to much for this to get a dirty bashed up computer. I am returning the item.

  I've gotten a lot of 'renewed' items off Amazon and this one is by far the worst. There's a generic screen/film on the outer shell, the including case was nice but the top cover kept falling off, the corners are dented and pushed in. Definitely returning this.

  Just received this in mail today! Shipping is super fast! First of all, this is a fantastic computer. I am fully aware that it is a refurbished unit. The condition looks like new. It saves me a lot of money! Second, my daughter absolutely loved this MacBook! I bought one for her high school graduation about a year ago. We we're debating between Hp and Microsoft Surface, but eventually picked this one as a surprise. After her first year of college she told us it was reliable, fast, and user friendly!Last, I would recommend this for any person who has a busy and continuous business or school related schedule!

  So, one thing I did not budget for when sending my daughter off to college was a MacBook.  I'm all ""Use your old laptop until my wallet recovers!"" which she was willing to do, but the professors recommended MacBooks and everyone had MacBooks.  I figured if she was going to be lugging it around, an Air was the way to go.  I absolutely could not afford a new one.  I was leery of a refurb, and even more leery of purchasing it online as opposed to a brick & mortar seller. This came in perfect condition and has been working perfectly!  My daughter said it's been a lifesaver (and I get to be the hero).  This was the most recently available one for the least amount of money.

  This laptop would have been great but there was a huge line down the side of the screen.  Obviously this impacts anything that you do on the laptop.  The description stated that it is refurbished and I expected minor defects but it also stated that the screen would be good, not the case.  Very disappointed.

  When I received this macbook and turned it on for the first time, it displayed an error message indicating that it was not able to find the mac operating system. I'm not sure what happened but I ended up having to call amazon who then transferred me to apple who then transferred me to someone else at apple who the had to talk me through reinstalling the OS. Overall, I had to spend ~4 hours of my life trying to fix a problem that this product shouldn't have had in the first place. I'm not sure what happened but I am extremely disappointed. You would think they would check to see if the OS was on the laptop before sending it out. But maybe I'm expecting too much

  So I was hesitant to buy a refirbushed computer but it arrived today and I am so happy I did. I read through the other reviews and checked all the negatives first. USB port works, runs fast, its 8GB as listed, not a scratch on the computer. Not one scratch!  No issues with set up. Camera works. Doesn‚Äôt come with extra long charger cord but description did not say it did. I‚Äôll update again in a month but for the price you cannot beat this! Mine looks new. :)

  Bought a Macbook Air for my son - supposed to be refurbished and ready to go.  His current laptop died and he needed a new one urgently for college.  This one arrived on Sunday and when he booted it up it was showing that it was still under remote management of some public school system.  No way any quality control was done on this laptop before being shipped out - it would not even boot to a usable state. Extremely disappointed - had to send him to best buy to buy a brand new one on Sunday for an extra $250.

  Arrived with many distracting scratches or something in the middle of the display. Little black marks that won't come off. 90 day warranty says they won't accept returns for ""cosmetics"" so I figured we would just have to deal with it. I spent about 7 or 8 hours transferring all of my gf's nursing school stuff from the PC to the MacBook. Today, we discovered that we can't sign in to iCloud, iMessage or FaceTime (even with a valid Apple ID). After several hours of trying troubleshooting from the internet, we caved in and called Apple support.After about a half hour on the phone with them, they found that whomever ""refurbished"" this macbook formatted the SSD incorrectly. I had to completely erase the SSD in order to reformat it to the correct format. I lost all of that time spent transferring yesterday.....but it gets worse. After having erased the drive, reformatting it and trying to ""restore"" it to an older OS so I could properly upgrade it, it bricked. I now have a $700 paperweight that I can't return.

  I didn‚Äôt want to review this product right away since i wanted to use it for a while before. After 3 months of using it i think i can pretty much talk about the experience.After weeks of thinking, i finally decided to take the risk and buy this computer. It was a good decision. I was pretty reluctant bc i didn‚Äôt think it was safe to buy a refurbished/used computer online cause you might end up with all kind of thing. I read the comments, it was globally positive but i saw some bad ones and it made me anxious. Well, at some point i had to decide so i jumped. The computer arrived earlier, in very good physical condition. I was mostly worried about the battery life bc that‚Äôs what the bad reviews were mostly about, but mine is great (so far).I could register my device at Apple and use all the Apple features.I‚Äôm very satisfied of my MacBook :-)

  Pretty good computer for the price!

  So! I was a little sketched out about buying a Mac off amazon but honestly.. it was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. It takes a while for the updates to occur, if advise you to look at the iTunes Store and software updates to have it updates to the most recently Mac book thingy. It‚Äôs so fast and it works so well.. I‚Äôm so happy. It‚Äôs so light weight and transportable. Perfect for the video editing! The speakers are so powerful and the screen is flawless. There‚Äôs a teeeeny tiny little scratch but it isn‚Äôt noticeable unless you look. It‚Äôs refurbished, what do you expect. It has 8gb of space and I‚Äôm so happy! I saved so much money.. thank you amazon.

  I was super skeptical about buying a used Mac. If you want a bargain this is it!!! No need to spend thousands these look brand spanking new, chargers work amazing. Completely satisfied with my purchase whenever these go down I‚Äôll be buying from here again!  My wife and I are avid Apple product users but after my cat pushed my MacBook Pro off of my very high king size bed I was quoted 800 to fix the jacked up screen because it was out of warranty by a month! So I instead moved all my stuff to an external hard drive and got these! Love love love! Will never buy new again. I promise you you will not regret this purchase!

  I bought 2 of these as Christmas presents for my teenage daughters. As a single parent with a single income, these are by far the most expensive gifts they have ever received. I was worried buying something refurbished and unseen but my expectations were exceeded! One laptop is in absolute perfect condition, everything from the lighting working correcting, no loose keys, and no scratches. One has some very minor scratches on corners, one loose key and the lighting only works on half the keyboard but given that everything else works perfectly and we had no problems with set up, we have no complaints! I am currently working on saving up to by another one for myself!

  So I took the risk of paying $400 for a refurbished MacBook Air 11.6 inch laptop with intel i5 8GB 128GB due to water damage suffered to my beloved MacBook Pro and I didn't have the $1200 for a new laptop.My needs were just being able to work online with some adobe applications, some movie editing and taking it around town for work.The first one I received looked good at first for the most part, some scratches and dents (it had clearly been dropped) but I expected some cosmetic damage, which could be covered with the purchase of a cover. However, after further inspection the black plastic piece that is the hinge from the screen to the computer was completely broken in two places. So I contacted Amazon and sent back the laptop in exchange for another. I figured if the next one was bad I'd return it and just have to save up for a new one.Well, 2 days later the laptop arrived and so far WOW! It arrived looking brand new, NO dents, No scratches except for 1 very small one on the bottom of the laptop which no one will ever see. Everything works perfectly. And its an 2.2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7 processor not an i5 processor! Runs fast, works great and I am very happy!I will update this review after more time has passed, but I am extremely happy so far!

  I've been using this laptop for 2 days now and everything seems to be going well so far! When i was first ordered this laptop, i was very skeptical due to many of the reviews being so negative, saying that the laptop came broken, or that it was iCloud locked, or school locked. It was just very difficult so i was very eerie when it was being delivered to me. When i got the product, to my surprise it was as if it was brand new! Literally nothing wrong with the laptop, except for a few things!1. Theres a very very tiny scratch on the screen, but honestly its hardly noticeable. You would only notice it if you were to try to focus on it.2. Secondly, the keyboard looks a little worn out, but thats nothing really to complain about!After setting up my own account, i realized that there was an account on here called test, and i tried many times to erase it, but i couldn't. Instead what i had to do was a factory reset, and surprisingly it was very easy. It's my first time owning a Macbook and i was scared to do the reset knowing how Apple's security tends to be with iCloud, but i had no trouble when resetting. Overall, really great product and would definitely buy again! Don't know if i was one of the lucky ones who got a really good product, but it was well worth the money!

  This computer was sold to me with no description ANYWHERE (I have all the screenshots of what was advertised) that the keyboard is for the Spanish language.. I did not want a Spanish language keyboard at all. Yet the default language in the settings is English. I naturally assumed I'd be getting an English language configured keyboard. It is not just a matter of switching keys or keyboards because the actual manufactured frame of this laptop's keyboard is configured to the specific shapes of the different buttons as you see in the picture. I am very, very unsatisfied. If I get good customer service and can return it for a refund, I'd change this review to a positive one to reflect that.

  This is a used computer. Keep that in mind. This is 100% luck of the draw. You are taking a risk. Hopefully it pays off for you. Bought ours from SupremeDealsCR because they had 99% on over 1500 pieces of feedback. Opened up the computer and it was so dented there's a big gap. Pretty annoying. Will try again.

  Was Skeptical about buying a re-ferb at first, after researching all the Mac's and suppliers settle on this one. Unit came on schedule, was in excellent condition, so far has run perfectly, and have recently updated to Catalina OS with absolutely no problems at all. Would very much recommend.

I had the slightest little concern  and they responded immediately and said they were giving me one with twice the storage  and a better processor. I was kinda skeptical about it being refurbished and on amazon but it works like new and it took me like 2 minutes to find the tiniest little scratch but u cant even see it with the case. i definitely recommend and its so worth it for 3 hundred dollars less. do your self a favor and save the money.

  It‚Äôs been one day since I have received this. I love it! It was in almost perfect condition. It‚Äôs super fast and has a good screen for a 2015 computer. It‚Äôs better than most of the ones out today that aren‚Äôt Macs. I would recommend getting the 4 year warranty just in case. I was nervous about spending this much money on a computer I could see in person or hold but I‚Äôm glad that I did. I took pictures in the dark. I‚Äôll try to update this review later with better pictures, lol

  Arrived on time and in a condition so new I had to look for 2 minutes to find just the tinniest nick.  Was pleasantly surprised to discover the I have a 500GB hard drive.  Shipped with new charger and seems to have great battery life. Highly recommend.

  I was weary to purchase a refurbished laptop HOWEVER, this computer has me pleasantly surprised. Besides a few small scuffs on the outer shell, the computer runs and looks like new. I don‚Äôt mind the scuffs at all, gave me an excuse to purchase a cute cover :) I have ZERO complaints about my experience with this company and the product I received!

  Really good specs for the price if you don't mind not getting the latest from Apple. The unit arrived well packaged and it looks brand new with very little evidence of previous use. Upgraded to Mojave with no problem. Pleased with the purchase.

  The laptop arrived in fair condition.  The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the ""renewal"" process.  Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger.  I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead.Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back.  This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe.

  This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend.

  This is actually the second refurbished Apple product ive bought, but the first refurbished one off Amazon.  Let me say.... a used, 5 year old model seems iffy, but looking at the brand new models I was sold on a refurbished one.I got this solely for the purpose of school.  Im in paramedic school and needed a computer, I have an iphone and ipad (refurbished) and decided to stick with the apple theme. Upon opening it the mac is in pretty good condition, the top looks new, screen is crisp and clear, speakers work great, keyboard has zero issues.  The battery charges to 100% and holds its charge well.  The only cosmetic ""damage"" is on the bottom of the mac which is absolutely ok with me, and its just minor scuffing.Ive had this thing 2 weeks now, and watching constant videos on the human anatomy, constantly doing/turning assignments in online, zoom class meetings, apple music lol and ive had no issues whatsoever.  I do have until Oct to return if desired, which if it keeps up like it is I wont be returning it.  Like other have said, if you want a mac but dont want to pay 1500+ for a new one, this is one great alternative!**UPDATE 02/21** Fast forward to February and this laptop is still going strong!! I use this for school as well as work and personal time.  Absolutely no regrets here.

  This is a surprisingly good MacBook for the dollars spent. This product came in pristine condition and could not be more what I needed. Personally even know it is not the newest model I LOVE the fact it not only has regular USB ports but also has an HDMI port so I can easily play thru my television. The keyboard also actually clicks which I prefer over the new style. The one thing I would say is that the battery life is not gonna last you what the a newer one would (Although that goes without saying). Overall I would highly recommend this laptop if your looking to own a MacBook but do not have the money to dish out for a brand new one.

  I confess I'm a ""cult"" fan of the MacBook 12. I bought two for the house when the 2017's came out - ""his and hers."" However, I wish that I could have gotten one with the i5 or even better the i7 with 16mg of ram. So this week when Apple announced they were discontinuing the line I eventually spotted this unit on Amazon. It was significantly less in cost than other colors. Could it really be because it was ""gold?"" I took a chance. An i5 unit with twice the storage as my first ones. Well the unit didn't make it in one day but a lone motorcyclist showed up at 9 am the following morning - with just my package. The MacBook was shrink-wrapped in an original apple box and all of the packaging looked new. At first I thought I saw some scuff marks but they were on the wrapping- interesting. The computer itself is in mint, like-new, condition. The first thing I did was look up the cycles on the battery and there were only 9. The computer was probably a return used only for a very short period of time. I had to upgrade it first to Catalina before migrating my data from my old MacBook - destined for a family member in need. I have it set up to run Parallels and Windows 10, Office, etc. Everything is perfect. The key to this unit as far as longevity and warranty is really the lone usb-c port. If it goes bad (and I know of two which did, both, coincidentally, in the rose-gold flavor) there's no way to charge it without getting it replaced. All I can say is this unit ""renewed"" arrived looking more like new, and the original apple packaging and power supply were a nice touch. All in all pleased especially considering how much I saved compared to the other i5's available in silver or gray.

  Be careful when purchasing this Mac. ive owned this for over 6 months now. worked fine, no real issues besides the charging port being a little jiggly. Notice the listing says ""newest model,"" this will be important later. Anyways only recently did I check ""about this Mac"" when I upgraded to OS Catalina. I bought the computer to use like a normal person and it never crossed my mind to make sure the item I paid almost a grand for was in fact the item that was listed. to my surprise and dismay, my ""newest model"" refurbished MacBook is a 2017 model. not 2018, not 2019. but the first year it was made. the MacBook 12"" was made from 2017-2019 then discontinued. Not only is this blatantly false advertising, but also a ripoff. of course my refund window has now closed, and I am left with a device that is two years more depreciated/obsolete than I thought. I am attempting to recover my original purchasing price from the seller, and will happily update the review when I receive return  correspondence. check your stuff folks. I imagine I am not the only person this happened to. This is not the ""newest version"" of anything. its the oldest version of the newest model. big difference.

  The 12"" MacBook is the greatest Apple laptop for portability ever! I love the small, light, size - super thin - almost as thin as the iPadPro. I can slip it into the case with my iPad - giving me the best of both app options: OSX and iOS. Though the MacBook is underpowered for video editing and such, it was more than enough for just about all other needs: browsing, video streaming, email and writing with Scrivener.I was looking forward to many more upgrades but Apple discontinued the MacBook in 2019 - however, there is talk of a new take on the MacBook this summer ... maybe with the Apple ARM A14 processor coming soon! In the mean time the MacBook is a keeper - in short supply.

  It‚Äôs a dated model, but it‚Äôs a Mac. It still works great. Love the fanless design, extremely light weight, and super low profile. It really can‚Äôt be beat if you‚Äôre die-hard Mac and looking for the lightest most portable fully functional Mac OS experience.I have a 16‚Äù MacBook Pro, so this is a secondary device for me, but honestly it‚Äôs not as duplicative as I thought it might be. I leave the 16‚Äù docked for the most part, and I reach for the 12‚Äù at times where I probably would have just left home without a computer or avoided pulling out the 16‚Äù.Every time I run errands, I toss the 12‚Äù MacBook in the car with me in case I need to answer emails or something comes up with work. When I‚Äôm on a plane, it‚Äôs super easy to take out of my bag, fits on the tray table, and can stay 100% charged on a $30 portable battery pack. Some people might reach for an iPad at times like these, but I just really don‚Äôt think you can beat the full functionality of Mac OS. An iPad always feels like a workaround when trying to be truly productive.If you‚Äôre missing the insane convenience of the 12‚Äù chassis and wondering if it can still function in 2021 as a viable device for productivity, don‚Äôt worry. Granted, I went with the highest spec, most recent model just to be safe, but it‚Äôs snappy even running Big Sur. I‚Äôm not doing anything too graphics intensive, but it honestly hasn‚Äôt given me a single issue. Even Airplaying content to my Apple TV is quick and snappy, something I thought might be an issue.Overall it‚Äôs just a real game changer for me - there‚Äôs just never an excuse to leave home without a laptop now, and with a mobile hotspot plan and a mobile battery pack, it‚Äôs just complete freedom to be productive wherever I go. I don‚Äôt see this thing letting me down anytime soon, but I hope one day Apple brings this chassis back with an M1, I‚Äôd buy it in a heartbeat.

  Great laptop, very lightweight and affordable! The battery does die quick compared to other apple products HOWEVER it will last you a day in class. The screen is good quality, backlit keyboard looks awesome and sound quality is great! Laptop is about the same size of a sheet of paper if not smaller. My laptop has a snap on case in the photo however you can see it‚Äôs still cery thin even with the case on.

  im pretty bummed that this simply wasnt stated upfront. it takes a full day to transfer data and get computer delivered. with cost being $850 and a new one was 150$ more, id have went brand new and saved me several days of all this return trouble. i think this is  a very irresponsible and unethical thing to do.decrease cost way more for a shot battery and state that clearly.

  ¬†Note: My purchase was completed through Kanga Supply for this item that ultimately doesn't function as intended.Amazon Renewed item descriptions indicate that the products should work and look like new, which wasn‚Äôt the case for this purchase, ergo my poor rating. After only having the Macbook for less than a day, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the product no longer functioned as intended.CONSThe Macbook worked fine for the first hour or so of use, but during an update, the screen flickered vigorously (see video). I hoped it was just a fluke, and it led me to believe there may be some software or hardware-related issue. After having the Macbook for less than 12 hours, I was forced to reach out to the seller because the screen flickering caused the laptop to become unusable (see picture). I also came here to draft a review in hopes that my issue is resolved quickly and effectively. I'll update my review once this is complete.PROSAfter removing the laptop and inspecting the outside, I was pleased. The outside of the Macbook is in good condition, just one or two visible scratches or marks.The charger was not the original Apple charger (as other reviews have indicated) but an OEM adapter. I don‚Äôt care that much about whether it‚Äôs an Apple charger, as long as it functions.Specs match the advertised item I purchased:128GB SSD8GB ramEDIT/UPDATE: After reaching out to the seller as instructed with the Amazon Renewed products, I never got a response in the allotted timeframe (2 business days) and was forced to reach out to Amazon directly. Ultimately, this item was returned for a refund.UPDATE 2: Today is 1/13/2020 and I have still yet to see this problem resolved to my satisfaction (refund or exchange of working product), after having ordered this product on 12/26/2019. Highly disappointed both in Amazon and the third-party seller.UPDATE 3: Received a replacement Macbook on 1/15/2020. So far it seems to be working, no issues with the screen per the previous item received (was NOT the same item sent back, verified by serial number). Pleased so far with this item.

  The 2015 Macbook Pro is still, in my opinion, the best Macbook even in 2019.  I use the SD card reader all the time and have several USB 3.0 devices.  I also use a newer 2017 quad-core i7 for work (no choice) but the difference in speed is not worth the added money and lacking ports.  When I actually put the newer 2017 to work, the heat issue is still a challenge for Apple and performance drops.  It's like having power that I can't actually use unless I sit in a walk-in freezer. Don't quote benchmark speed tests to me, what counts is actual performance sitting at my desk for hours at a time working on a project. I also prefer the magsafe power (although this one uses the magsafe II which I like less than magsafe I which had a more solid connection) This one, I purchased for my wife and it handles everything she needs it to do. Although you can't upgrade the memory on these models, so make sure you get enough for what you need.  If you want to change out memory, then the best choice is the Mid 2012 non-retina model which also come with DVD drives and has USB 3.0 ports.

  First off, I am removing a star because they shipped a counterfeit 60W Magsafe 2 charger with my order. I contacted them immediately and they offered to accept a return of everything. I explained that the charger was my only complaint and they overnight FedEx'd a genuine Apple replacement for free.""we sent you the wrong adapter for this batch of order and will overnight you the correct genuine one.""So they knowingly ship counterfeit chargers with some of their orders?The computer is pretty good cosmetically and operationally, but not as great as other reviewers. It is an Early-2015 12,1 model, this one was built in 12/2016. There is a crease over the right USB port from somebody yanking a USB plug. The battery has 107 cycles (89% life left). Keyboard and display are in great shape with no flaws. The SSD has no dead cells. It came with MacOS 10.13 installed.Overall its a good laptop and decent refurbishment job.EDIT: Knocking off another star. They sent me another counterfeit charger. Apple would never loosely jumble the cord in the box, a genuine power supply doesn't stay powered on for several seconds after it's unplugged from the main or stay lit green/orange after its unplugged from the laptop and this fake only puts out 25 watts max.

  I really feel like I got a great deal on this, mine arrived in brand new condition and it looked like it had never been used. I did see some people had bad experiences but mine was well worth the price tag. The only negative was that the charger provided is third party and not OEM Apple. The box is also generic and not Apple, not a big deal but you just don't get that same feeling opening it up as a new product. I will say that I checked the serial number on Apple and the computer itself was only a couple of years old, so in reality I paid around $450 for an Apple that was only a couple of years old with a decent amount of battery life still left. I only bought this as there was certain tasks that I could not do on my iPad and so I did not need a brand new super powerful computer. This one is great, does not get hot, fans are silent and the display looks incredible.Overall I was very happy with the purchase, it came fast and was like new condition at the fraction of the cost of a new one. I actually waited a few months before writing this review so that I could also include that I have had no issues at all in that time, battery lasts a decent amount of time and no software or hardware issues to report. It also runs the latest OS that I updated it to and I believe it will be supported software wise for some time to come. Completely worth the price!

  Arrived, boxed well with balloon cushions. Power adapter looked clean but had scratches. Opened up the Lid of the MacBookPro and it looked like it had some sort of disease or cancer & it smelled quite strange too. It had over 50% battery so I carried on with a reset which resulted in an error. Luckily it booted back into Yosemite OS that it had installed years ago, after 3 failed attempts managed to update to Mojave. Of course first things first copy music etc onto, USB stick struggled to go in either of the USB Ports (look at the photos) was also stuck after insertion but managed to pull out, with a hard pull - full force - anger. Had a look into the ports and discovered they were literally rusted dirty like disgusting, this is not the definition of Refurbished - but 2nd Hand or Heavily Used. Be aware, set your expectations right in oder to avoid any disappointments.

  ¬†I was super stoked upon arrival, began setting up the laptop and within minutes the screen stopped working. Literally pixels. Severely disappointed. I have gotten ahold of kanga and they are working to replace the device but it has now been over a week since I‚Äôve purchased the unit with two day shipping and still have nothing to show for it. I hope they come through on their end and send me a functional unit.

  The computer arrived for the first package, and it was in a good condition externally. There was no damage, and everything seemed pretty new. However, the trackpad and half of the keyboard did not work. Just like the water damage, the right side did not work at all. so I sent it back to the company and received the 2nd package. Trackpad and keyboard work perfectly fine, with all the ports working great. But it has so many scratches and dents. Either way, now I am using this computer, and it is not a solid state drive, it was a 500GB flash drive. I don't know why but the ""update"" does not work on this computer, so I am kind of lost and trying to figure it out. The tech support definitely knows what they are doing and really appreciate being nice to provide the package in quick time fashion and willing to contact customers.

  I ordered this laptop to replace mine after it was stolen. To be honest, This early 2015 model style is my favorite because it is the last time Apple left the assortment of attachments on their laptop. Having access to two USB 3 connections, HDMI, SD, and two thunderbolt connections are really handy for connectivity and losing them to get a newer model didn't seem like something I wanted to do.Having read the description and the reviews, some of which were claiming that this really was an Apple refurbished product I decided to take a chance. With my previous knowledge of the product, I was extremely disappointed in many things.1. Upon receiving the product there was no documentation included in the slightly damaged box. To ship the computer a white, unmarked cardboard box was lightly padded with bubble wrap and a thin sheet of white foam for protection. This box had been placed in a plastic shipping bag. I fell there was quite a good chance that in transit this computer could easily have been damaged.2. When I opened the box I realized there was no documentation. This lack of printed material inside only raised my speculation as to the shotty workmanship that may have gone into the renewal of the product. Without paperwork showing who did the work and whom to contact if there were issues, it seemed as if those who had done the work were not exactly pleased with their own workmanship.3. Although the laptop was clean it was not in a separate plastic bag to ensure it would not get scratched during shipment. The computer was merely placed among the packing material inside the box.4. Looking at the overall appearance of the laptop it seemed appropriate though it seemed as if the fine finishing Apple does to the outer metal shell was not correct. The edges are always crisp and smooth where there appeared to be rougher. I also noted, as visible in the image provided, that there was no tag on the bottom. Apple places a tag on the bottom of their cases with information including the model number. This number is used by several third-party companies that provide aftermarket items such as cases for their products. It also authenticates the product as being a genuine Apple product. With this missing, I feel there is an excellent chance that the bottom case had to be replaced in the refurbishing process leaving me to believe that hardware on the inside might have needed to be replaced.5. Once I turned the computer on I noticed some other details. The first is that whoever had set up the interface assumed you were using Xfinity as an internet provider. I was also extremely disappointed in this interface because of how generic it was, again not giving away any details as to who had done the renewal and giving rise to even more suspicion as to the quality of the product I had received.6; Having previously had the exact same model previously for several years I can attest that it is slightly slower than the one I had previously, the internet, as well as applications, do not respond with the same robustness as I would expect.So, this all boils down to, a consumer, I should have been more careful. I should have read the return policy more carefully noting that it did not have the normal 30-day return policy and that there would most certainly be a restocking fee if sent back. I should have thought through the fact that the renewal process may result in the cheapening of the quality generally associated with Apple products and that the parts used to restore the laptop to its original condition may not be on par with what Apple originally used.  I the future I will only buy Apple Certified Refurbished computers and not trust Amazon Renewed products to be up to snuff.

  I've only had it for about a week now and this 2015 MacBook Pro is working phenomenally! I was kinda hesitant buying a refurbished MacBook from Amazon, but I can honestly say I'm go glad I went ahead and did. It came extremely fast and right from opening the box, it was as if I had bought a brand new one right from Apple themselves. There's not a scratch, dent, stain, dust or anything on it. So far it's working extremely well and I will definitely buy form this seller in the future and recommend them to others as well! Great price for a great computer.

  I've only had it for a couple days, but so far this is a great purchase. The thing looks brand new, and I know it isn't. I am replacing an older Mac and just can't afford the prices of new machines from Apple. Using Migration Assistant (an app that comes with Macs) I was able to restore a time machine backup from the old machine, so I've lost nothing in the transition.

  I‚Äôve had this MacBook Pro going on 4 days and so far so good! It has met all my expectations and more. I grew up using windows PCs. This is my first Apple computer and I‚Äôm happy to have made the transition. Wish I did this long time ago but better late then never. If it wasn‚Äôt for the packaging and not being in the original box, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell this was refurbished. This is just based from my experience using MacBooks at the Apple store. Also, there was a few minor scratches on the bottom of the laptop.I will revise and change review in a month if any problems. But as of now, my review above is how I feel.

  I gave 5 stars because this was all around a great transaction, great delivery time and a GREAT Macbook! This was my first macbook purchase. I was very skeptical at first since the price was fairly low and there weren't many reviews. (plus I didn't know much about macbooks or what I needed to look for or avoid) I then decided to take a chance on purchasing the 2017 model refurbished and boy I'm happy I did. I received the macbook 1 day before the expected delivery. It was in like new condition with a brand new charger for it. It powered right on and I was able to start getting it set up and my programs downloaded. I am still working on getting familiar with apple Mac OS but I love it SO MUCH!! I highly recommend for the value. Now this macbook won't be able to run your hardcore fps shooter games like call of duty, overwatch or fortnite but I believe it would do fine with slower ran games such as SIMS, civilization, online card games and Simulator games. I don't know for sure if all of these games will or will not work. I just know Integrated Intel graphics isn't the strongest graphics card however this computer would serve great as a everyday work computer or a macbook to do video editing/uploading. It is very quick will a decent amount of memory. With this being my first Mac I am definitely pleased with the delivery, value of the macbook, the restoration of the macbook and I couldn't be happier!! Thank You Seller!! Keep up the great work!!!

  We ordered this product from All Out Apple; with the 90-day guarantee from Amazon we figured we couldn't go wrong. We paid for expedited shipping, and the product arrived a day earlier than we expected. It was packed well, and had no dings, scratches, or signs of extreme wear. The specs were as advertised, the software required an update. Screen and keyboard were perfect. A brand new Apple charger was included. I will update this if anything changes, but as of right now, this seller has my confidence.

  The MacBook Air is a fantastic product if you like highly portable notebook computers like I do. However, keep an eye on these resellers: when I ran the serial number of the unit I received it came back as an early 2015 model, not 2017. The item I received did not match the part number of the listing. I returned the item immediately.

  I have to say after reading all the reviews on here I was very skeptical buying this MacBook but to my surprise it arrived today and in mint condition exactly as advertised and professionally boxed. Also came with a gently used power adapter. Gave it a good sanitizer wiped own and now she's upgrading to the latest MacOS version. Love it!!

  I am writing this review after using the product for a month. I got a MacBook Air which looked brand new. I was not not able to find a single scratch or dent even with a very closer look. I ran the serial number in apple website to check whether it is a genuine piece and 2017 model. It came up perfectly ok. Checked the battery life and 100% happy with it. So far very happy with the device and got it delivered as promised.

  This MacBook was excellent -- until it wasn't. I think I just got a bad one. My wife has the same system, it's perfect. The design is almost perfect - super thin, light, long battery life; but Apple should have left a flash drive slot in  the side.The good part of buying through Amazon, is the return policy.  I used it about a week, then it suddenly became unstable. The OS would crash every few hours. Then it stopped rebooting. A few times I booted into 'Safe Mode', then that quit too. I ran Apple's diagnostics, all passed. Tried 'Recovery Mode', and after exhausting Apple's troubleshooting steps, I had to try reinstalling macOS. After erasing the disk and reinstalling, again it wouldn't boot. With no alternatives remaining, I returned it for refund.

  I've had Macs since they first were available way way back in the day and have always loved Apple computers. But for covid and no longer working, I've been short on money and couldn't afford to replace my old MacBook when the screen went out so I took a chance with a used 12in Air. Great little notebook that should work perfect for the light design work I do. It's fast and updated to 11.2 with no problems. My only concerns are the battery life and lid. The battery does not hold a charge for long (not 80% battery life ((a little over 100 charges left out of 1000)) as stated) so I'll be visiting Apple sooner than later for a Battery Service appointment and to have the lid tightened, if possible (And that's if I don't just exchange it - it took forever getting logged in and set up - password issues/user error üôÑ)

  The computer came in new condition and looked great. I just got it about 2 weeks ago and it works pretty good but I plan to return it because of minor issues. The computer will die at 20% and randomly turns off sometimes. It can't handle a lot and will get over whelmed easily when I have a lot of tabs open. When I turn it on it will take minutes to turn on sometimes. It definitely preforms like a refurbished computer.I bought this computer because obviously it is a much cheaper option than buying a brand new MacBook. Now that I have it and am seeing how it doesn't preform that well I realized it is better to spend more money on a new computer that will last much longer than saving money now on a refurbished one.Great for the time being though I do love this little MacBook but it is just a smarter decision for me to put my money into a new MacBook that will preform better.

  Two times in a row of damaged product. Unacceptable, be aware of screen lid hits (aluminum part) as they will certainly lead to screean damage overtime, not noticeable on day light but sometimeS noticeable on dark.

  Arrived in perfect condition and functions as new! One of the issues is the battery life lasts 2 maybe 3 hours max.

Otherwise extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend!

  For $700, this was well worth it. I already have a 15 in MBP and when I got this, the 15 in seemed excessively big.The size is impressively small. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with typing and the trackpad is great.This is a great purchase if you know what you are getting.

  I pulled the trigger on this thing hoping that the bad reviews were wrong.. some of the comments saying it came dirty and defective definitely gave me pause however, what arrived today was practically a brand new macbook. the device does not show any signs of wear and the battery cycle count is 18, it came with the original power brick and while the cable was used, it was not worn or dirty in any way. While i've only just started using the device about an hour ago, I can tell you that it's speedy and works flawlessly... had I not known it was a refurb when buying it, I would have easily confused it for a brand new mbp.. for those asking, this is a 2017 macbook pro and the specs as quoted are accurate. i'll play around with this thing for a little while and update this review as needed, but so far this looks like a winner!***update***A few months in and it‚Äôs still working flawlessly. I don‚Äôt regret my purchase for one second, and neither should you!

  Was excited to receive it and on the outside it had one noticable chip in the case on the cover side (which had a sharp edge to it), but thought that isn't too bad.  But when opening it up the screen in both the top left and top right were broken/chipped/cracked like it had been dropped and they replaced the cover, but not the screen.  This was not acceptable.  Wanted to try it out and ended up learning that some of the keys did not work right (sticky, pushed strange and such), plus the touchpad/mouse was really strange and didn't seem to work correctly.  Too many issues out of the box for me and too concerned that there might be other issues from where it looked to have been dropped and such.  Sending it back and just started that process.  So far the return seems ok....but just hate that the product does not match the description...using their words ""Renewed products work and look like new"".

  I ordered the space gray with 256 gb of ram and received a silver with 128gb.  I knew this could happen as the picture did not match the description and I had seen other similar reviews.The good news is it was on time and in flawless condition.  I think I will stick with it and not press my luck, as it is still a fair price and a great machine, but beware.

  I have to admit, I don't typically write reviews and I was a little hesistant about the product due to some 1 to two star reviews. The space gray model not only is at a great price, it came to me brand new. With all the specs I was expecting, i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, and works like a dream. Battery life is great, setting up was easy, and all my Apple Products (iPhone, Apple watch, Earpods) synced with no issues. I'm not sure as to why there were so many negative reviews, but mine is not one of them. SO HAPPY!! I truly recommend.

  Received in a timely manner.  Will review in a couple weeks.Well, it's been over 2 weeks since receiving my MacBook Air and I have to admit that it has proven to be worth it's price. The Retina display is phenomenal and it's compact chassis is just what I was looking for. I am not a power user, so I didn't need major memory capacity. The speakers are, surprisingly, crisp and clear for such a slim build. The fingerprint scanner is quick and a huge convenience. I am (or was) a long-time PC user and resisted getting an Apple, but the transition was smooth and Apple's claim to fame for being user-friendly and intuitive proved true. If you are looking for a compact, yet capable laptop with QWERTY keyboard, I would recommend this product.

  It should be known and expected that when buying a used product online, there's always a good chance of getting unlucky so take this as a warning before you order. With my order specifically, the delivery process was sub par but I did receive it before Amazon's initial set date. As far as the Mac itself, I did receive the Mid 2012 15inch Retina Pro model (though as useless as that information may be, it seems as though some other reviewer didn't get what they were expecting). It does have a handful of dead pixels that aren't very noticeable at all unless at the all black startup screen and other than that, it does have some bumps and scratches that are nothing to bat an eye at. Overall, I got what I was expecting and was pretty satisfied with my purchase

  ¬†I bought this machine, knowing that it was an older refurbished machine, because it was very similar to the one that I currently use myself.  I bought it for a student who had a project that is due ASAP and whose computer stopped working. I spent the extra money to have it shipped quickly and I spent the extra money for a warranty.  When it got here, it had a display with tiny flashing lights all over it.  It didn't matter which view - as you can see above.  Because we really wanted to keep this machine and get the student started on his school work, we took the machine to our local MAC certified repair shop. They didn't even open the machine up - they took a look at the screen and informed us that this display was ""glitchy"" and likely, due to the age of the machine, not going to last much longer.  So - we decided to return it. I ended up having to buy the student a new machine at the local Best Buy due to the time sensitive matter of getting school work done.  Because the machine was not checked over well before sending it to us and because I do not know if I can even get the extended warranty money back and I am out the shipping, and because we are having to send this machine back, I am giving it a single star. If the return process goes smoothly and I get all my money back, I will update this review and give the interaction a higher rating since I do believe that good customer support should be rewarded.  Currently - my advice is don't purchase this item. We did have a very good experience getting a used macbook air from a different vendor at Christmas time.

  Hi,I am overall impressed by the quality and condition of this renewed laptop.Pros- Condition is really good. Very little physical damage such as dents and scratches- Screen is beautiful, bright and a joy to look at. So glad I went with retina.- The performance is snappy. I use mine for software and mobile application development and it is holding it's own very well.Cons- I got a German Keyboard. I wasn't looking, but I did not see anything about the keyboard so I just assumed. Kinda difficult getting used to it.- The battery life is very short (about 3 hours). I expected as much as the laptop is about 7 years old. I will eventually replace to get better battery life: this is easy to do with this laptop.- I am unable to upgrade to Catalina OS even though the update is available. The disk is in the wrong format and I cannot convert.

  I bought this computer for the screen resolution because my eyes are not as good as they once were. I was not disappointed at all I can see the screen very clearly. And it operates just fine. I‚Äôm still learning a few Mac things coming from a PC but I can see that is going to be easier for me to operate. After running business computers for 30 years it‚Äôs time for me to kick back and have a little Mac funüòé

  I was a bit concerned after reading a few reviews stating that their laptop computer arrived DOA...  That was NOT the case with my order.  The Apple Macbook arrived in just two days.  It powered up, and functions like new.  The retina screen has no defects and the software & hardware advertised is present.  Time will tell if there are any unforeseen issues but, with the Amazon 90-day return policy, and Apple's reputation for excellent quality hardware, I am not at all worried

  MacBook Pro received is not as advertised, at all. The exterior is not like new. The aluminum body has damage. The keyboard is not like new. The trackpad doesn't even work, the pointer just dances across the screen! The battery cycle count is in the mid 400's, also not like new. So far, I've purchased a $999.99 paperweight. Reached out by phone, it went to voicemail (which is full). Emailed. No reply. False Advertising by DealFisher.

  ¬†Was very excited to receive this item but I quickly identified issues with the laptop which got frustrating. The left speaker is blown. I have this same laptop for work and was hoping to switch over my information. I played the speaker on both laptops side-by-side and this one is definitely blown! Also noticed that the keyboard is read ""1,2,4,3...?"" Definitely returning. Hoping to get a better laptop in return.

  Was expecting better. Crack/chip on the outside screen. Dent underneath. Battery life lasts about an hour tops.Product review said everything should be brand new condition. Battery life should be around 7 hours but no where near that. It only came in a sealed plastic wrap and a box. No other packaging. Very disappointed in this so called ""certified refurbished"" item.

  Purchased this item for my college freshman to take with him. It arrived. Its appearance was surprisingly good. It worked the first time I booted it up, but then it began to shutoff in the middle of use for no apparent reason. Rebooting would take several tries to be successful, even trying recovery mode and other boot options. My son took it to an authorized repair shop on campus. They said it would need (wait for it) a new logic board for $499 (Search Louis Rossman MacBook on YouTube to find out more about this phenomenon) . Rejecting the option to spend another $499, I told my son that we would just return it. He called me back on his way to his next class saying that the laptop was hot to the touch. He placed it on the cool tile floor for a couple minutes uncertain if it was even safe to hold at this point. It eventually cooled down. The Amazon return process was easy and painless. But once my son shipped it with the provided mailing label last Saturday, UPS has no tracking record of it, and it would appear that I‚Äôm out $1200 plus a $50 diagnostic fee. There are many problems with this story and a lot of blame to go around but nobody has time for that. Just be aware that this is a very risky purchase and could easily go very wrong. I have typically lucked out with this kind of thing in the past, but I have now become that guy who writes the negative review because of his terrible experience. You could become the next sucker.

  This is honestly the best version of MacBook pros ever made. No keyboard issues ‚Äî aka loud butterfly switches and flat keys. No Touch ID issues. It‚Äôs got the fastest processor and the most memory. Best bang for the buck. Only wish the seller (Supreme Deals CR) would‚Äôve replaced the battery since it came at 609 cycles (out of 1000 recc. cycles).  But I think that would just vary seller to seller. Computer was clean and worked great. Just had a couple dings on the edges hardly noticeable. Will hopefully last me a long time.

  I was really impressed with this purchase! It arrived sooner than anticipated, extremely well packed/protected and was in NEW condition !  There‚Äôs was not a single imperfection anywhere on the unit!  It booted right up to the latest compatible operating system, easily updated and transferred my data from the cloud back to the unit.  I was even able to upgrade to the new Apple Mojave public beta version!  I have purchased multiple used laptops over the years and this was by far the best condition of any.  Had I not known it was used ( I checked ) I would have thought is was brand new and that they mistakenly gave me a new unit!  Would buy from them again anytime!

  I ordered this MacBook as I am a photographer and needed a better functioning computer than my pc to edit photos/ do design work.The function of this MacBook has been great, runs fast, battery life is good, etc. However, when I received the mac there was a lot of cosmetic scratches on the bottom and there are a few dents on the sides by the keyboard where I can tell it has been dropped-- this did not bother me as I always put cases on my computers, however I have received refurbished products in better condition. I also had issues with my charger upon arrival where it was sparking by my Mac port when I plugged it in, not by the outlet-- so I contacted the seller (because after doing some online research I found out that the sparks produced were due to a faulty charger) and the seller sent me out a new charger without hesitation that now works flawlessly.So although there were a few minor issues-- they were easily addressed by the seller and the overall Mac function has been great, exactly what I needed and for that I am giving this product 4 stars.

  I've had this MacBook for almost 3 weeks now, and I've been very satisfied so far. Although it's refurbished it feels and acts new, and the charger was a new MacBook charger. All in all saved some money buying it pre-owned and still feel like I got a new product. And it came a day early.

  I had the laptop for less than 10 days and I already noticed problems with it. The laptop had a very low battery life and some keys were not responding, you had to press several times to get an output. I returned the laptop and waiting for my refund.

  Arrived in original Apple box, condition of the laptop was pristine. Battery only had 9 charge cycles.  My guess is that this laptop was purchased and then returned after ~1 week.

  I was in the market for a MacBook and based on the reviews I had seen here, figured I could save some money by getting a renewed one. The laptop arrived and ran decently well, but it was immediately apparent that the battery was no good. It would get very hot, and die in just over an hour if I was actively using it. I thought maybe I could get by if I lowered the brightness, ran few applications, etc. The battery was still dying way too quick so I decided to return.When I returned my refund was $500 dollars short. The seller apparently charged a $500 dollar restocking fee without informing me, because the return was past 30 days - despite this product explicitly being backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee.It has now been over three weeks since I returned the item. In that time I have spoke to five different Amazon customer service representatives over phone, email, and chat. Each time I have been assured that I will have a response in 48 hours, and when I call to check I am told no claim was filed. This experience has been beyond frustrating and I would stay away from this seller and Amazon Renewed.

  ¬†First I just want to say I was EXTREMELY skeptical purchasing such an expensive computer that‚Äôs not brand new but I received my new MacBook today and I am blown away! It came in the original apple packaging and is in pristine condition. There was not a scratch on it. I will do an updated review in 2 weeks but so far I‚Äôm absolutely in love!

  The compute exterior is in decent condition...except for the body screws underneath...they forced them in so the head was all stripped and they were half way in...and two of the screws in the bottom were missing...Screen in great shape...super fast computer for 2/3 of the price...great buy overall...I just wish sellers were not careless in the details...

  At first I was skeptical as any Amazon buyer should be. Thought it was gonna be a scam but I will say it is not. This is probably one of the best purchases I have made for the price certified refurbished clean and perfectly running macbook. Ready to update to Mac OS Big Sur and without a single scratch! I slapped a dbrand skin on it immediately and gotTo work downloading my favorite applications. It‚Äôs a good machine with perfect health.

  Screen quality is good. Has some elite features that regular laptops don‚Äôt have, but I‚Äôm sure most Apple laptops have the same. Easy to use.No touch screen for this particular product.

  From start to finish, dealing with Double Dex Refurb has been a pleasure.  I ordered my MacBook Pro 2015 back on 8/2/18.  After using the machine for a bit, I noticed that there was a singular click that would occur.  It would happen after a cold boot/reboot.  It was not easily replicated.  Double Sex support was very responsive and helpful.  After some basic troubleshooting on my side I sent the machine in.  My click could not be replicated in their labs, but being an awesome crew that Double Dex are, they sent me back another machine!  This one is working flawlessly and I couldn't be happier (currently writing this review on said Macbook)!  I would highly highly encourage you that if you are looking into getting yourself a refurbed machine, Double Dex should definitely be on your radar.

  Very disappointing.  Although the laptop looked nice on the exterior, it doesn‚Äôt work.  Touchpad and keyboard are completely unresponsive.  Called the Amazon Certified Refurbished Seller, Easy Mobile Services, as directed by Amazon.  Not reassuring the least as the phone number was not answered and the voicemail box was full.  Email to support was ignored, too.  Battery life abysmal-full charge gone in just over two hours.  I have long trusted  Amazon for quality items.  I can no longer do so.

  I had this computer and from the beginning it never worked right. Always shut down. Then after 1 month it just completely stopped working, won't turn on at all.

  Okay, so I will begin by saying that I was hesitant to buy a computer from online that I hadn‚Äôt seen and with limited ratings. First off, don‚Äôt just look at the stars for ratings, read the commentary as well. I know one person had given this purchase an unsatisfactory review because it was not the touch bar version he/she had hoped for...I find it to be the responsibility of the consumer to read and know what they are buying. Unless the transparency of this advertisement was changed, I think it is clear to see that this is a 15inch MacBook retina computer that‚Äôs being sold. That being said, I have been 100% satisfied with this purchase. The ability to add on the protection plan (accidentals included!) has given me a piece of mind, and rivals in store offers for protection plans on new computers. This laptop is in pristine condition and communication from the seller is timely. First a little background: I am a graduate student who needed a functional, fast computer with quite a bit of storage. I do not game so I was unable to provide a review for that function. Onward, the item came WELL packaged in a generic box and this heavy duty air type casing that probably could protect it from a pretty significant drop. That was one of the main things I was worried about, just because I know the term ‚Äúfragile‚Äù stamped on the side of the box does not ensure your package will not be tossed around. It arrived via FedEx‚Äîyou will need to provide a signature for it, so please be sure someone is home to receive it. The receipt, a couple of advertisement papers, the computer and the charger came in the box. To be entirely transparent, the extender for the charger is not included in this package, but the charger was wrapped in form fitting plastic just as you would purchase it from the store and it is 100% functional. The screen looks amazing and it literally feels new when you open it. a protection layer comes in between the keyboard and screen, just as it does on a new MacBook. The hinge isn‚Äôt worn out or loosened like it had been open and closed for 5 years; it feels NEW. Underneath had all the black foot tabs in place and they are tight. I will say that there were a few HAIRLINE, VERY SUPERFICIAL scratches. They are all on the underneath the computer; the top and sides are cosmetically flawless. The scratches are unnoticeable and don‚Äôt bother me a bit. LITERALLY, hairline and about 2-3 inches in length. This isn‚Äôt anything you would notice even in a picture because they are the same color as the computer. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but I had to place the computer upside down in the window (during the day time of course) to even see them. To me, they aren‚Äôt even worth mentioning but I wanted to provide an honest review for anyone thinking about purchasing this computer. Lastly, my decision was made from the recent release from Consumer Report‚Äôs laptop edition. Price was not an issue for me, so I didn‚Äôt seek out something within a certain range; I just wanted the best and something that would accommodate my needs (ports, storage, etc). So do your research from credible sources and pay attention to exact model numbers, not just brands and general models. I am not a hardcore Apple fan either, so I am not influenced by brand. In fact, I had recently purchased the newest windows surface book (I think that‚Äôs the name...it‚Äôs the detachable one) and I‚Äôm much happier with this overall. But then again, I was not adamant about having a tablet or touchscreen. I mean, you should know what you are walking in to with any computer you buy as a customer. I am so happy with this purchase. After looking online at several vendors, no other came close to the quality, size, and storage this one had. And as I mentioned previously, I recommend purchasing the warrenty with it for an added piece of mind. Also, it‚Äôs nice knowing Amazon backs this purchase. There are other third party vendors that are not certified so if a problem is encountered, you are relying on their integrity to address it, which can be hit or miss. This is why I chose this vendor over a couple others I saw selling this version of computer. I hope this helps someone. If any changes occur, I will come back and update this review. But honestly, if you are looking for functionality and are not swayed by the trends or okay with having an older Apple computer, this vendor/purchase is the way to go.

  The computer works great, new screen. very little unnoticeable scratches. I'm giving 4 stars because the seller claimed the computer had a new battery with 0 cycles. However the battery has 235 cycles on it and holds 85% of the original charge. the capacity is 15% lower.

  This is the second laptop received as ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù condition.  These laptops came with third party remote management software installed that requires a user ID and password from Trip Advisor Managing Agent that, if you actually had one, would allow them to setup and manage the software and files on your laptop.  According to Apple tech sit here is no way to get around this and it should be returned.  Very time consuming and still no working laptop!

  All I can say is that I will buy refurbished equipment from this seller in the future.  The MacBook Pro I ordered was in such good shape and arrived in working order.

  I was skeptical about getting a used computer on Amazon for seeing all the bad reviews, but this is great! Computer is fast, screen is great to look at, and works wonders. I'm a photographer and got it specifically for working with Adobe products. It's from a good apple era as well, when they made useful computers. Has an SD slot, HDMI, 2 usb slots and charging ports. If I had any complaints, it would be that there's a small scratch on the back of the screen (nothing that interferes with the usage) and the trackpad is just a little stiff. I still recommend if you want a good quality computer on a budget.

  This is the most honest review I can give, no intention to purposefully hurt the seller or Amazon Renewed...Cons:1. When they say renewed to be ""like-new"", DEFINITELY take this with a grain of salt. My product came with several scratches, the edges of the metal casing were worn, and all the open crevasses were either dusty (like an actually dust ball) or had some kind of yellow crust on it.2. There were about ten keyboard keys central on the MacBook, whose back-lights did not function at all or were so dim as to not adjust with the keyboard light settings.3. The MacBook was apparently not reset properly because it was locked by a TripAdvisor Remote Management software, which would require an account to login and actually access the computer.4. Platinum Deals customer service responded quickly, but after the first email it took a whole day to receive another response (unless it was Friday then they waited until Monday). This was a bit frustrating to deal with.Pros:1. Customer service from Platinum Deals was very kind and tried to help.2. Customer service from Amazon was very kind and tried to help.3. Since I was unable to get a replacement, I was given a refund and will have to look for this laptop elsewhere.OVERALL: the laptop was more in a ""like-used"" condition so definitely inspect the product and take pictures of the condition you received it in. Even though it says Amazon Renewed... be skeptical and do your own product check to make sure it satisfactorily matches your expectations. Amazon usually can be trusted for quality (in my experiences) but this definitely means that their Renewed program is not foolproof..

  Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon

  I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.

  UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.

  The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn‚Äôt turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn‚Äôt figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.

  Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.

  Beautiful laptop. I‚Äôve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn‚Äôt overly pricey to be honest and I feel it‚Äôs worth the price.

  Just got this yesterday and so far, so good! It was several days early (not expected until Tuesday, at the earliest, yet came Saturday), works fast, and is easy to set up.I had a bunch of complaints about it yesterday and almost left a crappy review and tried to get a refund, but then I realized that a lot of what I thought was ""going wrong"" was just a matter of settings. So the reason this gets a 4 and not a 5, aside from how ridiculously expensive it is, is that no one took the time to make it user-friendly before it got here.So, let me save you some time and tell you some things you'll probably have to do to make this work:Go to Apple-- System Preferences-- Displays to fix the lighting if you find that it is too dark. It may have an ""automatically adjust brightness"" feature selected that you'll want to unselect if you, like me, have vision problems.Go to Apple-- System Preferences-- Track Pad if you find your track pad is slow or you're having to pound really hard on it to click, you're not able to drag things easily, etc. Mine came with all of this set up basically the opposite of how you want it; my track pad sensitivity was set way low, which explains why I was having to pound. I selected ""light"" to fix this. The speed was also set to the slowest, so I set it to just south of the highest (the highest speed is really unwieldy, and I don't recommend it!).So these things are easy enough to fix on your own but ideally, the computer should come already set up with a track pad that works, brightness you can adjust using the brightness keys without it magically getting darker on you, etc. I mean, who wants to have to push super-hard to click things?! Why would anyone want that feature?! As a user in a forum noted, ""These machines are too expensive to not be perfect.""

  I was a little discouraged that right after I bought my Mac Pro Costco came out with one that had a bigger hard drive & more memory for the same amount of money.  And the battery automatically slows down the second I unplug it, so I always need to have it plugged in.  If there is a way to make my letters bigger I haven't figured it out yet, so I have to wear reading glasses when using my Mac.  I also am unable to download to Microsoft. It keeps saying there is an error when trying to update my Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office & my Gramarly.

  I miss the days when an Apple product just simply worked flawlessly. Prior to purchasing this laptop, I had a mac mini that I used for nearly a decade with no problem. Of course, I upgraded the components of the mini as time went on.After it finally died on me, it was time to purchase a new one. However, the 'new' mac minis were generations behind current technology and computing power. Yet, demanded an insanely premium price that was just simply comical. I purchased the laptop solely to remain in the apple eco system (those I use androids and Windows 10). I knew going in the specs were underwhelming, but I only planned to use this for web browsing and email. I have a real pc to handle real programs and to get serious work done (I built it myself with moderate-high components). With that said, I indeed knew what I was purchasing. The entry level processor should never have been utilized in the laptop. The fans can begin to scream only after a few tabs open in Chrome, and even during a single video playing. The webcam is shameful. The speaker quality is better than most, and the screen resolution is more than fine. The construction is excellent, as expected from Apple. However, the touchpad was never that great and often unresponsive from the beginning. Typing on this laptop is a pleasure. The battery is fine, but will have to be recharged daily after moderate usage (again, only internet and email). For a seriously limited laptop, $1000 is a serious stretch and I would not repurchase this item again. I truly believe this will be my last apple product after this dies, which I believe will be in just a few years. Save your money and apply it to a unit that will actually live up to its good looks and its price. Godspeed -

  I am so disappointed. While the screen images are sharp  and the colors bright and the camera and speakers better than the old Windows hardware I was migrating from, I found that the setup was flaky and many things, such as the Touch ID, just don't work. It's difficult to find files on the hard drive. It's hard to work with. The battery runs down fast. It was a lot of money for something that drives me crazy. Why should I spend so much money for something that is just as bad as a Windows machine? I made the mistake of trusting the reviews in computer magazines. This is my last Apple purchase.

  I kept the 12 inch MacBook over the MacBook Pro. I love it! Very light, and much faster than last year's model, which I owned as well. The new second generation keyboard makes all the difference, and fixes the most prominent shortcoming from last year's MacBook.Overall, I highly recommend the 2017 MacBook, and I'm glad I chose the MacBook over the MacBook Pro, which I returned, after comparing them both.I chose the 12 inch MacBook over the MBP for the following reasons:1. LighterI like the fact that I can use the MB on my lap, and it's incredibly light.2. Very QuietSince there's no fan inside the MacBook, it runs very quiet. Even the trackpad is much quieter than the MBP trackpad.3. Comes with 256 gb hard drive, as opposed to the entry level MBP, which comes with 128 gb.4. Fits in my shoulder bag no problem, which I carry with me everywhere, anyway.

  Logic board failed in little less than a year. It was replaced under warranty, but that doesn't mean it's reliable. This is my 2nd MacBook to suffer a premature logic board failure (my 2011 MacBook pro burned through 3), so I'm starting to think it's on purpose.

  After lugging around a (couple years dated) heavy MacBook Pro and/or iPad that can't perform all necessary tasks, this is my new best friend. Glad I made the leap - so lightweight, perfect for school or meetings, perfect screen size with gorgeous resolution, good battery life. Lack of USB is not a huge issue, but that's coming from someone who has the Pro with a superdrive, etc. Adapter is needed for any backing up, etc. I personally like the keyboard, I type 80 wpm, not sure if hunt-and-peckers would like it or not. Worked fine with SecondLife, which recommends 2 GHz (it's 1.2). Overall, I am more than happy.

  Works exactly as expected. I normally don't like getting used electronics, but took a risk this time and it works perfectly. I haven't had any problems at all.Update: After a little over a year of owning and regular use, I had complete logic board failure. My storage system is no longer recognized by the operating system. I took it to an Apple store where they diagnosed it and they told me it would cost $600 to replace the entire logic board, and there was 0 chance of recovering any data on the laptop. Luckily most of the data on the laptop was also backed up in other places, but I still lost a good chunk of data. I tried Rossman Group as well after having it recommend to me and got an estimate and they said they aren‚Äôt able to replace the logic board, as that‚Äôs not in their services. If I wanted data recovery, it would start at at least $450, and only had a chance if the laptop was a 2016 model or later. Any earlier and there‚Äôs 0 chance of recovery because this particular model of laptop isn‚Äôt able to be repaired. So to get it working again as a functional machine, I essentially have to replace the entire inside of the laptop, which is almost like getting a new computer. I‚Äôm disappointed that I got scammed like this, since there weren‚Äôt any negative reviews or logic board issues on this listing when I had purchased this item.

  I'm kindof dissatisfied.  So I just opened it and can't tell you everything, however I can tell you what I don't like that I already found.  The apple emblem is cracked and the power cord that it came with has MANY scratches, bumps, and scrapes all over it so I question if the cable even charges properly.  I know this is referbished, but can we please follow the policy ""external finishes like new‚Äù legit?  Aside from those so far I‚Äôm satisfied.  Scrolling on the mouse pad is Kindof meh but maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not use to it yet?  The keys are in fine condition and the finger print scanner works.

I can leave another review with more information after a week or so of use.

  I went with a refurbished bc I didn't want to spend 1,5000 on a Christmas present. This did not fit my daughter-was the worst Christmas present. It stated that it was refurbished, but my daughter could not even watch Netflix on this MAc. I returned and am waiting for my refund. The company only has a 30 day refund policy-so be careful. I bought it on December 2nd- she didn't open it until Dec25th. She didn't try to use it until the 29th. I had no idea about the return policy either. I hope I get  a FULL refund. It cost me 120 to ship to them because I needed to insure it for what it was worth. NOT WORTH IT-GO TO APPLE!

  When you hear the word ""renewed"" many think of previously owned objects with scratches, dents, and dirt. Despite the reviews of those who received faulty MacBooks, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the computer looked brand new. There were little to no marks on the outer shell, the screen looked as if it had never been touched before, and the keyboard was spotless. Although, the box came with no official apple packaging and the charger was third-party, the solid drive was wiped clean and the physical aspects were flawless. Everything works fine from the TouchBar to the Trackpad. Overall it was a great way to save money on a computer that is essentially brand-new.

  I have been a bit skeptical about buying a refurb Mac (not from Apple) and I have to say, looking good so far.  The computer arrived in actual MacBook Pro box, wrapped in bubble wrap inside a shipping box.  It came a day early as well.  Turns out and seems to have no issue so far.  My only complaint is, it wasn't super clean or anything.  I did give it a quick wipe down and all is well.  I did take the extended warranty through Amazon, so that helped me put my mind at ease.  Overall, I'm a happy customer.

  Apple really dropped the ball on their logic board engineering. This machine is vastly underpowered, and to make it worse lacks a well-thought-put cooling system. That is, this computer gets hit very quickly when you are trying to copy a lot of data, download, and watch movies, which is disappointing. My old MacBook Pro from 2015 is still better than this piece of junk.Dear Apple, hire me and I can help you. I want to help you because clearly you cannot help yourself.

  At first I was terrified to order the new MacBook Pro off of Amazon only because previously I had bought a MacBook Air from a different seller. However, I am so happy I went with this seller because not only did I get my package FAST but it's in perfect condition and everything is amazing!! If you're looking to treat yourself and are interested in buying this laptop, DO IT!!!

  Just stay  away from the new macbook pros with the touch bar. I've had to buy THREE of these computers in the last three months, and every single one had issues. The first one lasted a little over a month and I got the black screen of death. Then, my second one, the touch bar didn't work well from the start. The third one also had touch bar issues. I have given up on the new macbook pros and i'm hoping a macbook air (which doesn't have a touch bar) will be a better option. Such a headache!

  I love this laptop! I used to work for Apple and have always gone with MacBook Airs because they're so lightweight and portable. The new MacBook Pros are just as light and thin as older versions of the MacBook Air. The ONLY thing I don't like about this laptop is that 1/10 when I open the laptop in the morning after it was ""sleeping"" overnight, the screen turns on but the mouse & keyboard don't work, therefore I cannot login/type my password. I have to force restart the laptop every time this happens.

I do not like the touch bar, full stop. I wish they would sell a model without it. I‚Äôm also disappointed to spend so much money and get an chipset that is several years old. However, in practice I never saw any performance issues. I did end up returning it and sticking with my old windows laptop. It turns out that I am  actually just fine with my work laptop and an ipad.

  I highly recommend you purchase the ""like new""  Macbook.The item came brand new in sealed packaging and was $60 less. I'd imagine at worst, someone ordered it and sent it back, but it was never used or even opened.Highly recommended at this price point for the strength of the machine. All you have to do is click ""more buying options"". I hope this helps.

  Design- Apple has this luxurious products when it comes design and it really shows. The laptop is slick and has a nice color and has a great keyboard design. The bezels are a little big for 2020 standards but it still looks great and feels authenticBattery- Battery life is great and I get pretty close to the 10 hours if I make sure brightness is not to high and I am not doing anything too taxing on the machine. Charges relatively quick compared to my old Macbook airPerformance- This thing is fast! I mean really fast and I love it. No slow downs here but will have to update in due time. I love the quad core processor because it works just great instead of my dual core.Software- Gotta love mac OS but it will never be better than my love for windows. But man I love how stable and optimized mac os is and it is zippy and great.Thermals- Got a bit toasty when I first booted it and was syncing my icloud stuff. I had to start it afterwards to make sure the fans were working and my product was not defective. Thankfully after a reboot it does not get hot anymore unless I have multiple tabs open while watching movies and running other apps like spark and Itunes.Overall, I would rate this a 9 out of 10Definitely worth a buy since I am a big fan of Apple laptops and their craftsmanship!

  I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine. The M1 chip blows the Intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed, battery life, and ability to handle large Logic projects with dozens of tracks, plugins, software instruments, and live recordings.Battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my 2020 Intel machine. I am not quite getting double the battery life, but it's not far off. This isn't a huge deal for me, as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available, but for someone who needs the portability, the difference is substantial.

  I got my new MacBook Pro M1 two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it. This machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed, looks, weight/size, display, and battery life - and texture (it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as I type) and basically anything else you can think of. I also love the space gray color, the new keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the larger trackpad. There are so many options to customize the system to work just the way I like.My previous MacBook was the 2011 model and it still works today, but after 10 years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking, so after a TON of research, I decided to pull the trigger and get the New MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.A couple suggestions I am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over 30 hours researching the new MacBook are: go with the standard model of 8gb of RAM and the 256 ssd - you can get this on Amazon for $1239 vs $1299 at Apple - so you get to save 60 bucks, and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the Apple Store, who asked me rudely when I went in to get a new laptop ""umm, do you have an appointment? Well, you're going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store"". I love Apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iPhone and MacBook, but after that experience I will never again give my business to the physical Apple Stores. I mean, seriously, do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a $1300 laptop? Whatever dude.Anyway, in several YouTube videos that compared the 8GB ram model along side the 16GB ram model (costs 200 bucks more), the 8GB performed just as well in nearly every task - and they really pushed it to the limits. The only reason to pay up for the 16GB RAM is if you want to edit 8K UHD videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer - and even then it's not too much of a difference. For the every day user (me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional) the 8GB working with this new M1 chip is mind-blowing, blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water, and actually even performs just as well as the $2200 15 inch MacBook Pro using the Intel chip. As far as the storage goes, 256 ssd is standard - that's what I got - and you can pay 200 bucks more for 512 ssd or 400 bucks more for 1 TB. But with the Cloud storage available now, you don't really need to keep much on the laptop drive, you can just save it to the cloud.Overall I honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that I absolutely love about this machine. A free one year subscription to Apple TV is also another little perk. But I am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is. I've been online for over 3 hours now and its still on 92% battery. The new Retina display is brilliant. Everything is perfect. I truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook 13 inch M1.

  I own over 50 computers and it blows away my 11th gen Dell XPS 13 i7, My surface Book 3, my Ryzen 7 Thinkpad. the first week I got it the battery lasted for 5 days and 22 hrs of use and still had 20% left. I felt guilty and charged it. The Geekbench 5 rating beat all those listed laptops and they had 16 or 32GB of memory and the MacBook Pro M1 had only 8GB of unified memory. The keyboard felt great, the sound was superb, the screen bright, and it was blazing fast in all I did. I'm an IT consultant and deal in Windows based databases and this Mac has now become my daily go to system at home. It has become my new front end.

  Everyone says the new Apple Macbook with an M-1 chip is wonderful. However, I would say something different.For the Macbook pro with an M1 chip, I spent almost twice the price but got the same performance as MacBook air. The only 2 differences are the fan and the touch bar(it's useless).Secondly, would be quality. Once a time I put on the interface, the MacBook turns off itself. I don't know what happened but I'm pretty sure this kind of problem should not happen in a computer at such a price.Also, I miss the MagSafe...

  I'm going to preface this review with the 1 thing I dislike so we can get that out of the way.I mean let's be honest, that's what most people are looking for when buying a product-the down sides.It has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack EVEN THOUGH apple quit using that on it's handheld products years ago.Not that I care, it's good that they include the 3.5mm jack-but how come they didn't include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box? Forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or BT headphones (probably trying to push their AirPods line).Other than that, I have no issues. It's fast, efficient, reliable and easy to use. If your familiar with iOS on these then it'll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home.

  I bought this seeing the price tag. Seemed like a good deal. Got the product, after about 5 hours of use it would no longer turn on. I take it to the apple store a week later, it turns on when I get there, they run a diagnostics test: battery fails testing, charging ports fail testing. Does not turn on when we attempt to restart.K, time to return it. Whats the return policy? if you do not remove the accounts from the device, they can keep up to 50% of the return. Well how am I supposed to remove the account if the product doesn't reliably turn on. Why on earth is this my problem now?Several hours on the phone with amazon later, several weeks into the process, and after several screw ups from amazon's returns team, I finally got an assurance on my refund for sending the item back.Its not enough really. Thats my time down the drain dealing with all this BS. These guys have a 3.8 rating on Amazon, that is TRASH, and it was my mistake for not heeding that. A 4.4 rating is the AVERAGE rating on amazon, these guys are way below that and rightfully so. If you want a refurbished apple notebook that meets quality standards, you need to cough up the dough and buy through Apple directly. Don't give these guys your money.

  First off, everything with this computer internally is correct and exactly what I ordered. Battery is still fairly good with ~120 cycle count. Computer runs like it‚Äôs brand new. Computer even came with a brand new apple charger, which I was not expecting. However, in regards to the external part of the computer, there is definitely wear/tear/scratches even though the product description says looks like new. I am ok with the wear and tear as I still got a great deal on this particular model vs. other sites. There is a pretty significant and deep scratch underneath the screen next to the macbook pro logo. There‚Äôs is a chunk/dent on the left side of the computer base and there is a scratch on the back. Personally, I am fine with these issues just because I got an awesome deal but just don‚Äôt expect your model to come in external grade A condition. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with my purchase.

  The laptop is in almost brand new condition. It has a few minor scratches here and there but overall fantastic condition. Overall Battery life is great. The processor can handle everything i put it through and i have even BootCamped it for Windows 10.Obviously everyone knows that Macs are not meant for gaming however i do play Tetris Effect when i boot this Mac on windows and the laptop handles the game wonderfully, but keep in mind that the fans will end up blowing at full speed if you play for extended periods of time and yes. It can handle Minecraft.

  Bought this for my wife who needed something with some CPU and basic GPU power for computing (small video editing, streaming). Worst piece of junk I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of buying. I'll start with the faulty motherboard ports, which don't work on one side due to the laptop most likely having been just thrown into a box and declared ""GOOD TO GO"" instead of an actual circuit check. Battery power is nonexistent even on easy processes like surfing the web. The wifi adapter is also garbage (-50 MPBS off a 600 dollar windows laptop). The screen is advertised as retina display but not only does it look like junk compared to a 600 dollar windows laptop from dell but the vaunted 'powerbar' feature quit working within a month. Charging is slow even with multiple chargers, does not hold a charge...contacted seller no response.More importantly, this is a mish-mash of AMD and Intel components. DO NOT buy this machine if you want any sort of satisfying experience. DO NOT buy this machine if you want a working laptop for more than a few weeks. DO NOT buy this machine even if it looks like a deal, because between Apple's faulty engineering and the non-existent refurbishment the laptop came with I would have been better off setting fire to my $1500 dollars. Buyer beware on this ""deal"".Worst laptop I've ever bought.

  In my opinion, the 2020 MacBook Air is a perfect laptop. It has physical keys that are a pleasure to type on, a beautiful screen, an optimal size, good pricing, and a quad-core processor. The only ""touch"" button is the fingerprint sensor and the touch pad. The onboard graphics are as good as discrete graphics from a few years ago according to benchmarks, which is impressive. The speakers work well. Being an educator, I purchased it on the Apple Education Store for $1200, and it couldn't have come at a better time, given the transition to Zoom in the coronavirus pandemic. Thank you, Apple, for rediscovering yourself. I had been holding onto my 2012 MacBook Pro because I was unimpressed with the offerings the past few years.You shouldn't get this if you are looking for onboard power, but if you are, you probably didn't need me to tell you that. Otherwise, get it. It's great.Update: After reviewing benchmarks and reviews, I believe the upgrades you should consider, in order of priority are:1. i3 -> i52. 8gb -> 16gbThe i5 -> i7 is a small boost in power per Geekbench scores, but again, this isn't supposed to be used for heavy computing due to cooling limitations, so this is a novelty in my opinion. Additionally, the storage upgrades (up to 2 TB) are hard to justify when you have EXTREMELY FAST 40 GBP/s thunderbolt 3 ports that can easily be used for an external SSD that is more or less as fast as the built-in SSD. Unlike the other upgrades, which are set in stone once you purchase the computer, the memory can be increased with external hard drives with little to no compromise. This upgrade is a novelty as well, in my opinion.Update 2: The computer works well in most situations. Because of some laggy moments while running a lot of programs, I will be returning the default configuration I ordered and getting a customized i5 or i7 and 16gb ram. During Zoom screen sharing (and while many other programs run), sometimes the fan will whir (it's supposed to), but I installed a CPU temperature app and it appears to regulate temperature successfully. I haven't tempered my praise for this machine, because it's not supposed to be a performance workhorse.

  It has been widely reported that the camera on the 2020 MacBook Air is low quality, but mine was definitely in the non-acceptable range. Picture was very grainy, unfocused, and low light level. I strongly suspect the glass in front of the video chip was damaged, perhaps for a contamination during assembly, but have now way of checking directly. Cleaning the outside had no effect.With heavy heart, I decided to return the unit, and buy an equivalent from the big-box store, where quality can (and will) be checked before purchasing.Update: refund for the item still pending, 14 working days after the returned item was delivered to Amazon. Worse than expected and worse than advertised (14 calendar days)

  The original MacBook Air is retailing for like $749.99 right now. Don't buy that. It looks ugly and it's old. Buy the new refreshed 2020 model. This model is authentic, straight from Apple, and it looks fresh.One downside: Open it in a garage or something. I opened it in my room and my room smells like aluminum. Overall, this is a really good product for day-to-day use.

  The camera has a poor image quality (only 720p) and the fan gets very loud during FaceTime/Zoom calls. The MacBook Air 2020, like the MacBook Air 2018 and 2019, has very poor thermal design because there is no pipe to connect the fan to the CPU's heatsink.The MacBook Air 2020 is suitable for causal use. But even a video call will push the CPU's temperature to a 100 degrees celsius. Because of the poor thermal design, the fan becomes loud and the device will thermal throttle (meaning it limits the CPU's speed in order to reduce its temperature). This was not a present problem in MacBook Air devices produced before 2018 as the CPUs in those devices were properly cooled (the fan was connected to the CPU with a pipe).With the 2020 MacBook Air, you get a loud fan and a CPU performance that cannot be sustained for a longer time. The problem becomes even worse when you connect an external monitor to it.The most important advantage that the MacBook Air 2020 has over other Apple laptops is that it is the only one which still has a keyboard with no Touch Bar. So many people dislike the gimmicky Touch Bar in the MacBook Pro, as the Touch Bar ends up getting in your way and slowing you down.This would be a great laptop if it has a proper thermal cooling system and a better camera (at least a 7-megapixel sensor capable of 1080p).UPDATE (December 2020): If you are interested in MacBook Air, you should get the late 2020 model with the M1 Chip. It is fanless and much faster than the early 2020 model.

  For the average or small business person this computer will do more than enough and is a vast improvement over previous models. Catalina OS though sucks, otherwise would have given it a 5 rating. Problem is a lot of software I need for work is limited or won't work with Catalina. Yeah, you can take a chance and transition back to High Sierra or whatever but that's not a task I would want to handle myself personally and in checking with several computer guys in the area its not worth the cost, puts the price right back up to where the MacBook Airs were priced before. Keyboard is heaven, processor is fast enough for the most part, other than Catalina its great. Apple, get your act together, Catalina is not what most people want or need in my opinion.

  I like the computer, I'm just not super happy with my decision to purchase via amazon renewed. I went through with this purchase hoping that I would get lucky and receive a like-new MacBook but knowing full well I could get one with some light blemishes on it, and I was content with that. The one I got, however, had some pretty heavy scratches all over the bottom side of it. The top, screen, and keyboard are in pretty good condition though, and the battery cycle count is only at two. It's pretty obvious that the computer was used much more than 2 battery cycles so I'm guessing the battery itself was replaced more recently than the computer has been used . I'm just a little disappointed at the cosmetic condition of the laptop, which is what I was really worried about when purchasing one that was refurbished.

  I got the Mac 15-inch model with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB. When I opened the computer, the screen was blinking. There was no physical damage to the computer, and the box was completely intact. I believe this computer was not going through any process to check the quality and the problem of the computer before it was resold to me. It was very disappointing. I returned the laptop, and I‚Äôm waiting for a refund. The refund was not what I was looking for because I called customer service, and I asked Amazon customer service for replacement, but they said I must get a refund and then buy again whatever I want. The whole thing will take time, and this is another disappointment.

  About two months after purchasing, the battery periodically stopped taking a charge. I sent the laptop in to the warranty provider, who determined that it could not be fixed and sent a replacement. The replacement was in worse shape than the original, with some keys sticking.When I asked for a solution, the only option was to keep exchanging laptops . Meanwhile, I was without a laptop and spending hours doing backups. My request for a peripheral keyboard or partial refund was denied, and I was put through the Amazon appeal process.My appeal was denied on the grounds that I was not eligible for a refund -- even though I had never requested one!Products like these are too expensive to risk getting ones that don't work. I recommend staying away from the Renewed program.

  *This is an addition to the initial review below.  After paying $750 for the screen repair, the hard drive completely crashed a few weeks later while I was in the middle of a project.  Because this model has the hard drive soldered to the motherboard it is unrepairable.  I bought the computer in October and this happened in March.  $1500 plus $750 repair got me 6 months out of a machine.  Lesson 1: Get the extended warranty for your laptop . Lesson 2: Don't purchase renewed from these folks.I bought this Macbook Pro at the end of October. I was really excited about the product and value! I did notice the N key was more illuminated than the others and seemed to behave in a ""sticky"" manner, but was willing to overlook this issue for the price.  I had good buyer confidence with the 90 day warranty. However, after 120 days the monitor display went out rendering the machine useless. After to taking it to a local shop for evaluation, they said the repair would be $750.  I decided to reach out to the company. I called and left a message with a detailed description of the issue.  After not hearing back after a week I sent a message via Amazon. After another week I resubmitted the same message which is as follows:Greetings. I purchased this renewed MacBook Pro at the end of October.  A few weeks ago the screen randomly stopped working. It won't even work to recognize and connect to a second monitor.  I contacted a repair shop. They said it is very common for that model and year for the internal display component to go out. They also said Apple had an extended repair program for those models for those years with that problem. However, this computer is exempt because it is a rebuild.  This computer is just outside of the 90 day warranty from my purchase.  Is there something that you can and are willing to do to help me out with this situation? I am making monthly payments on a computer that is not working that I've only had for less than 4 months. Thank you for your time and consideration!I finally, after the third attempt, heard back. They simply told me to contact the warranty company. As you can read in my message the product was already outside of warranty. I was just hoping the company would show some integrity and stand by their product.  I am making monthly payments on a machine that lasted less than for months and is now rendered useless unless I shell out another $750.  Please be weary when trusting this company with your money.

  Avoid this at all costs. Literally couldn't even boot it up because of a critical error. I even tried a hard reboot and still nothing. Why didn't they check this beforehand? Why send me a broken computer? Why waste both of our times?

  The Macbook Pro I received crashed when the lid was closed (with an external monitor attached), infrequently had an audio click, and had some well-worn USB-C ports.If this had been my first Macbook Pro, it would have been my last.  However, I know he product line well and love 'em.  I own another one of this same model, so I knew what to expect.Amazon makes things easy to buy and easy to return, so I don't regret going this route.  This particular unit was just a lemmon.

  Very good product, I am very happy with this purchase. Powerful and fast. Only downfall is that a pro model at this price and it only has 2 usb-c ports?, I think it will work fine for me but might be a big problem for people that use multiple add on items for recording audio and video at a higher quality that what the computer itself can produce. If u want more than the 2 usb-c ports you have to upgrade to the 1799 price model.

  Very happy that I purchased this Mac Pro, it is more than I expected it would be!  After doing lots of research as to which model would work best for me, I settled on this one and could not be happier.  It works like a dream and it does not get hot at all.  The battery lasts all day long and I charge it at night when not in use.  It is lightweight which makes it very easy to carry around from place to place.  I purchased a hard cover case and a protective sleeve and had no trouble finding one for this model.  Watching videos or movies on this screen are amazing! Everything is so sharp and clear. I love the lit keyboard too!  Typing on the keyboard feels great and the keys make it is easy to type well.  I also connected a mechanical keyboard to this Mac and it works well.  I am able to connect many electronics using Bluetooth without any problems.  I really love that I can sync my iPhone, iPad and watch to this computer and respond to text messages and emails.  The face time camera works well with a great camera.I love all the apps I am able to download and work on anything.  This is a great computer for work and for fun for sure! I also love that I can stream movies and plug in all the sites such as Amazon Movies, Hulu, and Netflix into one app and have it available without having to go to numerous places.  I am still learning my way around this Mac but so far, I am in love with it!!  Definitely worth the cost and would buy again for sure!

  UPDATE: Bummed. After only 3 months I have a vertical, 2-inch thick stripe that goes from the top to bottom of my screen. The colors are inverted/x-ray like. It should not be doing this after only 3 months.Love this little computer! It's super fast, intuitive, and lightweight. It's so easy to carry around compared to the PCs I've been using for years and years. Should have switched to Apple a long time ago. Sharp picture, vivid colors, love the touch bar just under the screen. I thought the transition from PC to Mac would be difficult but not at all. Glad I made the switch.

  Apple has changed since my iMac and then my 2008 MacBook love.  This one takes some getting used to.  However, enough about it has stayed the same that it remains intuitive - if you know Mac.The system is quick, and smooth.  Updates were awful to get to work due to glitches in OS Big Sur, but I did manage to work around it and now everything is working properly.  That is not the machine's fault, but Apple's.The design is sleek, compact, and clear.  The display for the Touch Bar is new to me, so I can't speak to it as of yet.  I have used it for a couple of things and find the volume and brightness are a dream.  Emojis are ""cute"", but I have not used them yet.This is the perfect product for what I have to do to work.  I don't know about games yet, but I do have a gaming laptop that will handle what I need to throw at it so I am not too worried.The battery....not sure how they get 10 hours out of it for marketing, but I can get 4-5 even with a lot of use.  So, that is a bonus over a couple hours on the beast of an Omen PC laptop that I have.I had to purchase an expensive flash drive to use with the Thunderbird ports and that part I did not like at all.  But, that is the way Apple works.  You either love it, hate it, or love to work with it.So, for now the computer is good.  It is a shock to get back to Mac after being so PC integrated, but I think I will manage with more opportunities to use it.  I live on the computer now as I work from home so it won't take long.At this time, I do recommend it.

  Ok Apple MacBook Pro M1 assessment: MacBooks are like a dumbed down version of a PC. They lack numerous capabilities and functionality in their effort to streamline, they have security (T2 chip) features that hinder and inhibit you, the storage system is a disaster unless you purchase at least 1 TB initially. iCloud sucks because it keeps the file on your computer even though it's in a cloud ""what the h**l is that???"" Support is a joke because they designed their computers so they cannot be manipulated. However, they are Fast,  Powerful and Function streamlessly. In conclusion- I'd take an amped up PC over a Mac any day. It's mostly just hype

  The first Amazon renewed laptop I purchased from a different seller cosmetically looked fine but had a terrible sticky keys issue and I had to return it for a refund.  I then purchased this laptop as a replacement.  It didn't have any sticky keys issues and performs well overall.  However, there is SIGNIFICANT exterior damage to the laptop especially around the sides/bottom.  If Amazon is going to back these as Renewed meaning that they are to perform and look like new then there needs to be more quality control in place because no one on earth would say that this laptop looks new.  I'm irritated that what was delivered was not what was described but I don't want to wait 3 weeks again to go through the return process just to end up with another USED laptop.  Overall I guess it's a good deal for the money so maybe I should just be happy with it but Amazon or the sellers need to up their game on delivering a product that matches the description.

  I changed over to Mac/Apple products 9-10 years ago and never looked back.  As a photographer, it was strongly recommended to me to look into Mac for my creative work.  I hesitated over the cost, but in the end, I'm happy I took the leap.  Yes, Mac products cost a lot more than their PC counterparts, BUT, there is a reason for that.For one, they stay on the cutting edge of technology, and while PC has come a long way in the past 10 years, Mac has managed to stay ahead of the curve.  Plus there OS is great, and so much easier (and indescribably faster) to use than Windows.  There is a slight learning curve to start, but it didn't take me long before I realized how much simpler it actually is.Second, they last.  I realized when it was time to upgrade my first Mac, ¬±5 years after I first purchased it, that the cost balanced out to the same as it would have to replace a PC laptop every couple of years.  I even got a trade-in value back to apply to my 2nd desktop (which I am still using, today).  I have also had 2 MacBook Pro's in that time span, (this is the 2nd) and I had the same experience.That said, as the cost of PCs has increased, so have the cost of Macs, and it's a considerable investment to make all at once, especially with the hardware requirement I have for my creative suite software.  I purchased from Double Dex Refurbished, and I am thrilled with their products and their customer service.  I contacted them with a question and they got back to me the very next day.  They were more than happy to help and super friendly.  If you look at their reseller page you will find that their renewed Macs are practically rebuilt, with upgraded memory and a new battery, before being shipped out.  The one I got very well could have been brand new.  The physical condition was pristine, and the battery had only been cycled a handful of times.  I got a brand new Apple charging block/cord with it, and diagnostics showed everything internally was pristine.  I absolutely recommend Mac, and especially with this seller, if your apprehensive about the cost (I paid about half of what I would have for the same machine brand new) lookup Double Dex Refurbished.  I personally am so grateful that I found them and will be seeking them out for all of my future Mac needs.

  So, I received a computer that was in great condition (physically) and actually the 2TB version even though I ordered the 1 TB model.  It was in perfect operating order.

  The laptop would not boot up when I got it. It would let me get through a few steps of the setup process, then it would become unresponsive and eventually shut down, then restart, then freeze, then repeat, etc. etc. I talked to Apple Support and tried a few different restarts (NVRAM, SMC?), and tried re-installing the OS. None of that worked, so Apple Support concluded that there was probably a hardware issue. Very disappointing. I love Amazon, but they need to do better than this with their renewed electronics.

It has been almost two weeks since Amazon received the defective laptop I returned, and I *still* have not received my refund. This is outrageous. The return process was easy, but it absolutely should not take almost two weeks to get a refund for the large amount of almost $2,000 that I paid for a defective product.

  What can I say? I was hesitant about this. I pay 1,600 l, no taxes and 1 year no interest (Amazon Card) for a almost brand new Mac. Flawless condition, not a single scratch. Over that I‚Äôm still covered under Apple Warranty. So I save money and I‚Äôm happy. 5 star rating all the way

  The computer appeared as expected.  We plugged it in and it worked very well.  But as soon as we unplugged it everything stopped working and it was clear the battery would not hold any charge.  We called for the technical support available and they confirmed we needed to return it.  Return and refund process was easy and relatively fast.  I gave it three stars since the computer didn't work but they stood by the return and refund policy without any problem.  We have ordered another refurbished MacBook Pro because the cost savings are worth it to us and we know from experience if it doesn't work as expected the return and refund will be no problem.  Would sure have been nice for it to work the first time though.

  This computer is really great very fast.  I've only exported 3 min video so far but it's very quick.  Only small issue is you do need a case it seems to scratch easily or may have been already so make sure you get a good case.  I really like this new computer and much faster than my old one!!  If you use adobe you may want to get more disk space.

  Amazon's certified refurbished program is neither certified or refurbished by Amazon. As a result, customer service issues get routed through their ""A-to-Z"" guarantee, delaying any and all action that can be taken to fix problems.The refurbished MacBook I purchased had faulty hardware, however, it took me months before I could confirm it. I went back and forth with Apple support, purchasing different types of usb-c Hubs, using different networks, factory resets, additional troubleshooting, using different devices on the same networks to confirm, back and forth with customer service, and more. I requested a refund. They required I pay for return shipping. I did at a cost of $67. It was delivered three weeks ago. I not have I received the refund.Two weeks ago I opened an ""A-to-Z"" claim with Amazon, being told I needed to wait 14 days to receive word back. This is already a week after the seller received the item and two weeks after they agreed to the refund. 14 days later, I contact customer service again only to be told they meant 14 business days, or 20 days instead. Now I am on the hook to wait again. I am out $1700, not in possession of the item, and have been toiling for three months trying to figure this out.I finally got fed up and went to Best Buy to get a new MacBook. It works perfectly right out of the box. By trying to save $500 I ended up costing myself much more.According to the certified tracking I paid for when shipping the item back, the seller has had the item in their possession for 30 days. I still have not been refunded.

  I bought this MacBook as I needed a well built (long lasting), fast, compact laptop that can handle day to day tasks in addition to creative work down the road (I am trying to get into Photography and Video Editing). This laptop checked everything off my list.In addition, I wanted a laptop that can seamlessly sync with my phone (iPhone 11 Pro). I love that I can answer calls, respond to texts, and read emails between all of my devices automatically without having to really set anything up or picking up my phone. The screen is also one of the best to look at in my opinion.I briefly had the 2019 entry level model of the MacBook Pro 13 with 2 ports but I quickly returned it as the 2 ports where quite limiting, I wasn't satisfied with the performance, and the butterfly keyboard was not my favorite and gave me anxiety. I am glad I waited a bit longer for this refresh before going for the higher end model as I am actually saving money as I did not have to purchase upgrades to get the 16 gigs of ram I wanted and I also get twice the storage as well which means I don't have to buy an external SSD, until I am much closer to starting creative work.So far I am very impressed with the MacBook Pro and it is so far my favorite laptop to date solely because it works so well with other gadgets I have. The only thing I could nitpick is it still feels expensive for the specs but you get what you pay for, this is a sturdy/premium feeling laptop and blows away any of the laptops I have purchased in the past that feel cheap. If I run into any issues I will update my review but I can't wait to dive in further.

  This is my first mac computer and coming from windows based computers this thing is amazing. I don't think ill ever go back to a windows pc. As with all apple products the quality and feel is the best. As for the computer itself it arrived in perfect condition and a day early. The new 2020 13"" works flawless absolutely zero issues with setup and initial operation as is expected with the apple premium paid. If you're debating on switching to macbook pro or upgrading your older macbook I don't think you'll be disappointed.

  Compared to laptop PCs I've owned, the battery life on this is terrible. I have to charge it a couple times throughout the day (I'm not even a ""power user""). Other than that, it seems to work okay. It's NOT as fast as I thought it would be, coming from using a 3-year old Dell XPS 13. I thought this would be so much faster than that, but it's only a minor noticeable difference. Not sure it's worth the price, since a PC with similar (or better) specs can be had for less money. There have also been issues with the ambient light switching between blue to ambient-- that's annoying (a quick online search will show that others have had this issue too). Also, when I try to update some apps it says, """"...cannot be updated because it was refunded or purchased with a different Apple ID"" -- maybe this was a returned machine? If so, that's not good either. IDK.

  This is first time I am posting review and I am very frustrated with amazon. Actually I am prime member since 2016 and I but almost every week from amazon. This is the first time i am very disappointed. Package arrived 1 week delay than guaranteed delivered date by UPS. I ordered new macbook with 16 gb ram and 1tb ssd but received 8gb ram and 256 ssd probably old released macbook. I opened laptop about 40 minutes and setup all necessary steps and it just blinked few times and shutdown automatically and didn't turn on back, I put laptop in charge but it didn't response anything.  I called to amazon technical support and one gentleman tried to help me out but didn't work and he connected call to apple store with export and finally that man asked me serial number and after checking serial number, he said it's not 2020 16gb ram, 1tb ssd laptop, than I checked laptop box and it said 8gb ram, 256 gb ssd.Because of covid 19, my all classes is in online so I tried to work whatever I got but it even didn't turn on. It's so frustrating. Finally I decided to return it and get windows from best buy.

  This review has to do with Amazon‚Äôs customer service during my entire experience with returning this laptop. Safe yourself the trouble purchase directly through apple and save your self the money and headache . I returned the laptop since it did this weird glitching twice and for a brand new laptop I did not feel that was a good sign so I returned it ....... then the nightmare started. After two week I called because I did not receive any correspondence. I called and found out the laptop was received a week earlier . The agent said they were testing the item , which I understand it‚Äôs a more expensive item and they have their procedures. I called back a week later and the agent was like oh that‚Äôs weird I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt release the funds so he went ahead and did it and then explained that because it was a ‚Äúlarge amount‚Äù it would have to be in three releases.... $1700 for Amazon is pocket change . But I was like whatever as long as I get my money back . Now here i am a month later on the phone as I type this STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK!!! BUY YOUR APPLE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM APPLE YOUVE BEEN WARNED !

  As a long time Mac User, my old macbook is still holding up pretty well! I was expecting to upgrade to the rumored 14 inch Macbook Pro, but it did come.After window shopping a lot of PC Laptops, especially Dell XPS, I am still convinced making right choice buying this once I open the package. Apple still delivers the best quality product!PC vs. Mac?PC may seems offering better value, they are NOT stable, after 2 years usage, it would comes with millions of glitches.Mac = STABLE, No Hassle, functioning good for years!

  It is a great laptop so far, my first Mac and moving from windows hasn't been hard at all. If you come from windows the level of detail of some features will surprise you. Be aware that the laptop's first usb-c is the one that works for second display. I recommend to buy an adapter for usb and hdmi.

  If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.The good.- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4"" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the ""happy medium"" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.""4 (now 16"") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.The Bad- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.If you're upgrading from the 13"" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.

  The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ...Yet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity.Now that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ?Apple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that.Lastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ....

  Edit: The prices change quite a bit, and Amazon doesn't do price-matching, so keep an eye out for that. There's a website that shows the lowest price for each configuration, so check that out first before buying. I ended up returning my i7 MBP to get the i9 because 512GB of space just isn't that much, and definitely wasn't enough for my purposes. Both are excellent machines and I'm waiting to see how hot the i9 gets under sustained load.I used to have a lot of apple products, with my last macbook being the 2012 13 and 15"" macbook pros. I ended up giving those to friends as I transitioned to a new windows-based laptop for college.7 years later, and I finally had a compelling reason to purchase the newest MBP: a normal keyboard, USB C, larger screen, and improved thermals. My main gripe with thin and light laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th gen) has been that their thermals are awful. My hands would burn up while typing, even after a good repaste and undervolt. It also didn't help that their screens were on the smaller side.I've had the new MBP for a few days now. I bought the base model i7, and while I'm enjoying it, I do wish I sprung for the i9 at the very least due to the 1TB of storage. I have handfuls of external storage, but it really gets annoying to have to go through different drives when storage fills up. I do use more storage than a typical user IMO, as I typically have Bootcamp installed along with different CAD programs, IDEs, datasets, etc. However, I'm sure the extra storage would be nice for anyone.So far, the transition has been great! My only issue so far has been the battery life - 10 to 11 hours is definitely a stretch, and I personally found myself running out of battery after 4-5 hours of heavy multi-tasking, fans at a constant 60% (basically inaudible in a packed starbucks), at full brightness, with a lot of external power-hungry peripherals. Honestly, that's not that bad!

  This is the most recent version of the Intel-powered MacBook Pro and offers a lot of computing power.  I got one of the few being offered with 32gb of RAM.  Most available only have 16 gb installed and the RAM is not upgradable on these new machines.  The extra RAM cost me dearly.I would have preferred a machine powered by the new A1 chip but they do not yet come with 16‚Äù screens.  Another consideration is that I just upgraded to the 64 bit versions of MS OFFICE and Adobe Acrobat Pro, at a significant cost, and do not want to deal with the incompatibility issues that will arise with the A1 chip.  Lastly, this MacBook Pro will outperform all of the A1 based Apple machines currently available.In a few years I may go to an A1 machine but for now this MacBook Pro kicks butt!

  I've been an Apple user since 1987. My last MacBook Pro was a late 2011 17"" model. It served me very well all these years. Never understood why they stopped that screen size. So the the 16"" came out, this was going to be as close as I could get (real estate-wise). I had maxed out the last one with RAM and 2 TB SSD. Now I have this one with a lot more power. I am really impressed with it's performance and features. The touch-ID is super useful. I do miss the ""break-away"" magnetic  charger. So I'll have to be careful.I went with the faster processor and video card so that I get more longevity to the usefulness of my Mac in the coming years. So far so good. Loving it.UPDATE: the screen is really delicate. I was closing the lid and the arm of my glasses got caught between the screen and body.  The screen cracked. It cost me $1,100 to repair because it is not a warranty repair. If I had bought AppleCare Plus at the time it would have covered it as an accident. BUY YOUR INSURANCE FOR THIS.

  I love my MBP laptops. I needed one with 32GB RAM MINIMUM and no one had them in stock. Apple quoted weeks longer than I could wait. I found this one. The quoted delivery date was JUST IN TIME so I bought and hoped it wouldn't be late. It wasn't late, it arrived a week sooner than promised! It's a 2019 MBP 16"" with exact specs above. It seems to be better behaved than a nearly identical I also had with identical specs except half the video RAM. That other one overheated and froze often. This one does not running the identical workload.I am also happy to say this does not suffer from the 2018 MBP bad keyboard. The keyboard seems great (though I use an external BT keyboard at my desk).Like all modern (2018-present) MacBook Pros the Thunderbolt/USB C ports are touchy. If they are touched or bumped the connection can break. How you configure your devices is also essential in heat management. Bring the power in on the right (facing the mac like you are using it) seems to solve some of the overheating problems. I often need all 4 ports in use and what/where/how you load them can be important but no diagnostic that I can find in MacOS helps you with that. This model and this specific machine is the best of 5 different MBPs I've used in that 2018-late 2020 timeframe.My biggest beef other than the overheating is OS X 10.5 -- Catalina. It's a pretty icky version of MacOS but 10.15.7, the latest at time of writing, seems to have stabilized. The problem might be more with Docker Desktop than Catalina but as a developer the ability to use Docker is pretty essential.

  I wasn't going to bother getting used to the butterfly keyboard, so before purchasing this machine I was still using my 2014 MacBook Pro 15'. This new laptop is a solid upgrade and I only have minor complaints about the useless touch bar (I would so much prefer the physical keys) and the lack of SD card slot to transfer pics from my camera.

  I‚Äôm using this laptop to edit 4K videos for my YouTube channel. It‚Äôs very solid!, but I would recommend buying a laptop cooler. This laptop can get very warm if you‚Äôre editing for a long period of time. Other than that it‚Äôs a great laptop!

  I bought a maxed out 16-inch Macbook Pro from Apple a few months ago. I just want to warn anyone intending to do video production, motion graphics, or animation that this computer is not really up to the task. It has terrible heat management issues and routinely crashes and restarts itself in the middle of renders and exports.I've been a loyal mac user for over 15 years and used to swear by them but, do yourself a favor, and skip this one. It's not worth the price tag and will cause you many headaches. You'd be better off with an iMac or splurging on the Mac Pro if you simply must purchases a new mac.

  Spend the extra cash and get the 64gb memory version. MacOS is a thirsty OS. At 32gb it was getting closer than i'd like under heavy PS/Web browser use. So I'm pushing it, but the future it will only get more memory greedy.

  This is definitely a good upgrade to MacBook Pro Series, and specs says all about it.For the seller feedback, they've been amazing. I got my delivery on time and I had emailed them for the the receipt and some further questions and I got very quick, detailed and satisfactory replies.As for this MacBook Pro, the screen is stellar and the new keyboard is definitely better for typing.I loved the audio on this one. Bass is good for a laptop and the audio is loud, clear and crisp, as compared to other laptops.I haven't felt the difference of 64 GB RAM as of now. But, I'm sure it'll be a big boost when I work with something that uses RAM like crazy. Combination of Visual Studio, Chrome and XCode should do the trick.I registered my MBP on Apple.com, as soon as I got it and the product checks out.I wanted a matt black version for MBP, but since apple doesn't do that, I bought a DBrand Skin for it and it looks good.As for softwares, some may not run. For example, I'm unable to run Pro Tools First on MBP. Upon checking their forums, Avid is currently working on fixing this.Till now I'v successfully ran these:1.) Adobe  Photoshop2.) Adobe XD3.) Adobe DC4.) Adobe Premier5.) Logic Pro X6.) Final Cut Pro7.) Pycharm8.) Visual Studio Community EditionEDIT:After using this for nearly about an year, some of my observations:1.) The area around the screen panel tends to heat lot more frequently. Not that alarming, but, yes, can happen when you're constantly charging it or doing some heavy load of work on this.2.) I have been able to run a VMWare smoothly with running windows 10 inside it and playing some games inside that VM, like Prince of Persia Sand of time (older release) and Hitman.3.) Tried playing CS:GO directly (no VM) and with 1080p resolution, I was getting around 40 FPS on an average. With the graphics card mentioned in the specs, it's a let down to get 40 FPS on an average.4.) Ran 2 Android Emulators, 1 iOS Simulator, Visual Studio and Android Studio, all together without any noticeable lags or issues. Pretty cool, huh?5.) I have been using Ableton on this system and it runs smoothly. I was able to run 6+ instances of Serum 2 (with 16 Unisons on all and 4x Quality) and it worked just fine. Also, in the same project, I had 160+ tracks and every other track had at least 1-2 Waves VST running on it. It started to lag a little, but, I then connected my audio interface and increased the buffer size to 2046 samples and it the project now runs smoothly.6.) I can see some lag when I try to play a 4K video on this device (after Big Sur upgrade). I think that's more of an OS upgrade issue, rather than the machine issue.7.) Photoshop and other products like Adobe premiere work just fine and the rendering speed it pretty good. I've exported some 3-4 minutes long 1080p clips in hardly 5-10 minutes. Good enough for me.No other issues so far, everything works fine * touch wood *.

  I am very happy so far with my purchase arrived a week earlier as well. I have been using the MacBook for 1 day and its everything the reviews said it would be, Apple got it right with this one, the sound coming out of this computer is the best I have ever heard from a computer very high end. Its too early to say anything else but so far I am very happy, price could be lower but its Apple. Expercom price can't be beat will buy from them again packaging was also excellent.

  The price and service of the seller is simply outstanding!  I originally was ordering the computer from an online seller with a $200 discount, but I found eventually found this computer was about the same price with WAY more features to include the 64GB of RAM, is higher-speed processor (2.4 GHz versus 2.3).  When I ordered the computer, the estimated arrival was 17-27 July.  I received it today, 7 July, 5 days from the date I ordered it!I can't say enough about this computer.  I'm a professional photographer/videographer and have been testing all aspects of the computer since receiving it.  To say it's fast is an understatement!  The clock speed on the 2TB SSD is 2860.9 MB/s write and 2690.9 MB/s read speed!  I also purchased a LaCie 2TB Rugged SSD Pro for use when editing photos/videos.  The speed is 2002.7 MB/s write speed and 2395.3 MB/s read speed.  I tested the SSD by copying a 4GB movie to it which took about 2 seconds.  The sound quality coming out of the speakers is exceptional.  They far exceed any speakers on a laptop I've ever heard and are very pleasant for someone who is very picky about sound quality.  And when paired with the PowerBeats Pro bluetooth in-ear headphones, the sound quality is simply stellar, even the base.Lastly, I've never had a touchbar on any of my computers since this is replacing a 2011 Macbook Pro (yes, it lasted 9 years, but the graphics card finally gave out).  The touchbar, to put it mildly, is intuitive!  I can be pretty oblivious to things, but the touchbar really speeds up various processes.  All you need to do is glance at it when you're doing something on the computer to see various options it gives you at the touch of a button.  It is going to really speed up my workflow.Investing in a computer like this is a costly venture, but at least in my case, the cost is definitely worth the speed and the ease of use!

  I think the Surface Go is a fantastic device if you don't set your expectations unreasonably high. For reference, I got the 64GB base model, a black type cover, and a Surface pen.After unboxing, setup takes slightly longer than ""just a moment"" as the device likes to say, but if you've already got a Windows 10 device, it's pretty quick and easy. Following the initial startup, the device will need to download a variety of updates, but within 2 hours or so mine was fully up to date after multiple installations, restarts, etc... standard computer update affairs.I switched it out of ""S mode"" almost immediately, because I didn't want to be bootstrapped to the Microsoft store, and it's nice that they give you the option. It doesn't require any restart or anything, and allows you to install apps from anywhere.Regarding performance, I have done email, lots of internet browsing and video watching, movies, drawing, and light photo editing and social networking. The device is not lightning fast and it doesn't need to be. It rarely lags more than a second or 2 to open programs but if you're used to a higher performing desktop or laptop then you will notice. The glossy screen is beautiful and photos and videos look great. There are front firing speakers that sound pretty decent but not much better than your average smartphone speakers, but this is understandable. The device makes zero noise as well, no fans or spinning disks are present here and it rarely gets hot to the touch.Really any light duty thing you would do on a normal Windows 10 PC can be done here. And that's where this thing shines, it's versatility is just head and shoulders above laptops because of how wonderfully portable it is. It feels sturdy, good in the hand or in the lap, and the fully adjustable kickstand is magnificent. In my opinion, the add on keyboard is absolutely essential. It clips on quickly and easily with nice strong magnets. The keys are small and take some getting used to, but having a full keyboard with back-lighting in this form factor is amazing. They are far better than on screen typing. The trackpad is also wonderful, it looks silly large on there but that is a good thing. It's responsive and has a nice clicky feeling.I don't think that the Surface Pen is nearly as essential, but it is fun and works excellent. I could see myself using it for casual note taking, there is virtually no noticeable lag.The charger the device comes with has a proprietary port, but you can also charge it via USB-C, which is great if you have a phone with that port, because you only need one charger while you travel.The only things worth complaining about on this device are made up for by its sturdy build and excellent functionality. It makes a fantastic bridge between the smartphone and PC, perfect for when a smartphone just isn't enough and a full size PC is too much. You don't even need to stow it during takeoff and landing on planes!!! So, set your expectations to a realistic level and the Surface Go, even the base model, will meet them.As an added bonus personally, the Surface Go has helped me use my smartphone less, to the point that I removed most social media from my phone. When you don't have Facebook and Instagram in your pocket at all times, it is pretty amazing how quickly you realize how often you used to mindlessly scroll through your feeds. So you could say it has made me more mindful of my screen time and helped me leave both it and my phone in my pocket or out of reach more often, which we could all use a break from now and then.One more thing... this one is just a tip. Don't buy office! This device has a small enough screen that it qualifies for the free version of MS Office Mobile. Search online for how to get them!UPDATE 2/4/19: I've owned this for several months now and have had zero issues. Changing out of S mode and installing Chrome and other non-Windows store programs has been no problem, no noticeable impact to memory usage or performance. Battery life is still good, just a great little device to have.

  If you need a PC to do light work and can live with a 10 inch display, you'll love it. Or maybe you want a tablet that can be more than just that. I like the whole philosophy behind it, a device that you can take anywhere and use it in all your activities. After using it at work I can take the keyboard off and watch a movie or browse the web while listening some music or use a pen to do some digital painting as a hobby, It's just so versatile. I think this is the closest thing to what Microsoft wanted to achieve with the Surface line. Even closer than the already great Surface Pro.And there's this premium feel to it. The magnesium body feels very solid, the kickstand doesn't move if you don't want to and if you pair it with the Alcantara keyboard it's just a very different experience that you can feel. And yet it's so light. You'll have a disappointing experience touching a plastic laptop after using one of these.The downside is that it isn't precisely cheap. If you want it to be more than a tablet, you'll have to add the type cover keyboard, around $100 or more if you buy a Microsoft one (it's also great but I'm not reviewing it here). This just happens to be an affordable Surface product, and they're always expensive. But also so versatile and innovative that you'll find they worth it.It's also very sturdy. I found that out yesterday (there was a dog involved), it fell from a feet high right on the edge of the screen. I thought I would find a shattered or cracked display, but there was nothing on it. Not even on the edge, not a single dent or scratch on the whole thing, and it's working like if nothing happened (I'm using it to write this review).Most people complain about relatively short battery life but you can work for hours on it. I get it to work the whole day with the screen at its darkest and the battery saving mode on. Unless you use it outside that's enough brightness and performance for what you'll be using it. Another common complain are the thick bezels, but they're there for a reason, which becomes very obvious when you use it like a tablet.This might not be the device for you if what you want is high performance for CPU or graphic demanding tasks (and of course it's far from being a gamer PC) or if you really hate Windows. But if you're looking for a portable PC/tablet you can't go wrong with this. It's light, sturdy, completelly silent, has a sleek desing and offers a full desktop experience. And if you already own a Surface Pro you'll find this fascinating and even charming. It's a scaled down version of it.

  Great portable computer. I have the Surface Pro 3 so I am familiar with the Surface family. I decided to see how long I can use the Surface Go with windows 10 S OS, which means that you can only install apps from the MS Windows Store...so far, so good. If I have a need to upgrade to Windows 10 Home, the switch is very easy via the Windows Store...just remember, you may have to update the Windows Store app then the upgrade to Windows 10 Home, for free, is available.I use this as a secondary computer to surf web, watch Netflix, work on MS Office documents...works exactly as advertised.

  Let me count the things that don't work....I can't download PDF files from my Gmail account, so much of my email is useless.When I try to login to Steam, no typing interface pops up, so I can't login and access my games.I can't download a Kindle reader, so I can't access my books.I can't access Amazon Prime streaming video, so I can't access videos! NOTHING WORKS!!!In sum, I spent $540 (including tax) on this piece of garbage, and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- I planned to use it for works. Maybe one day Microsoft will work out the kinks. For now, stay away.

  Pros:‚Ä¢ USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won‚Äôt feel worried that you‚Äôre not going to bend it.‚Ä¢ The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.‚Ä¢ Cortana listens to you pretty well. I‚Äôm learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.‚Ä¢ Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.‚Ä¢ Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it‚Äôs placed on my lap.‚Ä¢ microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)‚Ä¢ Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you‚Äôre planning to edit videos on this.‚Ä¢ Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and‚Ä¢ Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don‚Äôt expect the same results when using an off-brand.‚Ä¢ A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.‚Ä¢ The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.‚Ä¢ The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it‚Äôs quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.‚Ä¢ I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:‚Ä¢ The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can‚Äôt be ignored in 2019. It‚Äôs very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).‚Ä¢ With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.‚Ä¢ Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it‚Äôll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.‚Ä¢ The battery life isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôm getting around 8 hours of power. That‚Äôs having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it‚Äôs nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.‚Ä¢ Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn‚Äôt test these as you only get the tablet.‚Ä¢ Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we‚Äôre already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.‚Ä¢ I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn‚Äôt for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you‚Äôre going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It‚Äôs disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you‚Äôre pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can‚Äôt attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can‚Äôt tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I‚Äôm also irritated that Microsoft didn‚Äôt at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you‚Äôll know that Microsoft put all their money on what‚Äôs inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that‚Äôs the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I‚Äôm always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can‚Äôt do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you‚Äôre getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

  Purchased this item trying to make sure I got the right item and non-defective so I went with the one sold by Amazon.com. I opened it and started filling out all my information, applying a screen protector and all of this for nothing but madness. I wasted many hours out of my day just to end up returning this item. This was actually labeled with a label printer as Surface Pro 7 on the box but I wanted to make sure I got the right product which I didn't! I actually got a Surface Pro 6. I did not know if this was an intentional scam for all customers or I just had a fluke. Anyways here are the pictures and now I'll be exchanging the item for this same exact one... I mean an actual Surface Pro 7. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR MODEL ONCE YOU RECEIVE THIS ITEM!

  Comparing Dell XPS 13, Lenovo Yoga C940 14 and Surface Pro 7 2-in-1's all with i7-1065G7 CPU/GPU.[SP7 PROS:]-Best 3:2 aspect ratio is better for productivity (but screen is uncomfortably small) > XPS 16:10 > Yoga 16:9-IR camera for Windows Hello face sign-in, though not useful when docked or when screen is not at the correct angle-Least weight 2.4 lbs > 3 lbs for others-Quietest fan > Yoga > XPS (loudest)[SP7 CONS:]-Worst battery life (even worse than SP6)-Smallest 12.3"" display with thick bezels-No 4K UHD option (but I recommend FHD with any brand/model for battery life, you can always dock to a larger monitor)-No Thunderbolt 3 with PD/DP (no eGPU)-Keyboard and pen sold separately[XPS PROS:]-Up to 32GB RAM > 16GB on others-Slimmest-Fingerprint reader on power button > Yoga on palmrest > SP7 on non-included $160 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID[XPS CONS:]-No USB-A (deal breaker for me)-No black exterior option. The white interior option keyboard is hard to see with the white backlighting-No far field microphones for Alexa or other assistants-Included charger is only 45W (less than 65W with Yoga/SP7)[YOGA PROS:]-Best screen-to-body ratio (89%) > XPS 84.9% > SP7 76.76%; although the hinge factors into this-Largest screen 14"" > XPS 13.4"" > SP7 12.3""-Deepest key travel, most comfortable keyboard > XPS > SP7-Better Arrow Keys + Home/End/Pg Up/Pg Down layout-INCLUDED garaged pen with internal charging > magnetically attached and not included with purchase on others-Best in class speakers.

Not available on SP7. eGPU great for gaming, allows modular upgradability of graphics cards in the future, although they lose ~20% FPS compared to PCIe.[PRICING:]For i7, 16GB, 512GB with Windows 10 Home:YOGA 4K $1785 > XPS 4K + pen $1900 > SP7 FHD + type cover + pen $2160[CONCLUSION:]The SP7 was the most expensive when you add the keyboard and pen. The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.

  Didn't want to wait two days so I went brick and motor to buy this today. Laptop manufacturers take note, THIS is how you do a cost down version of a premium product. I got the 128Gb model and I would highly recommend not getting the $550 unless that's the absolute limit on what you can spend.Lets start with the screen. Despite the resolution hit compared to the Surface Laptop 3 this screen STILL looks amazing. Nice colors, the 3:2 aspect ratio is REALLY nice and I really wish laptop manufacturers would get the picture already and make 3:2 computers already for people that work more than they watch YouTube videos, and while it can't use the Surface Pen with this screen I think Microsoft thought that if you really need to buy a $140 pen you can probably afford the Surface Laptop 3. I kinda agree since this laptop doesn't really target the high end crowd, it's more of a budget computer.Keyboard feels great! The keys aren't mushy and they're also not obnoxiously loud. Just the right balance of noise to feel. Bad news though, the keyboard isn't backlit. Somewhat understandable since they need to get that advertised long battery life and backlit keyboards do suck a lot of power over time. They keys feel nice and evenly spaced out. No short shift nonsense although Tab is a little smaller but that's fine. The fingerprint windows hello is really nice and way quicker than the one on my phone too.It does run a little hot when on the lap but not uncomfortably hot. And it only gets loud when I'm basically torture testing the thing. Otherwise for video chat or writing things or general browsing and light work it's nice and quiet. Also unless you have the $550 version turn the Windows S mode off immediately. No offense to Microsoft but the Windows Store sucks.My only real complaint is that I really wish there was an Alcantara variant. I love the soft feel of the Alcantara keyboards the few times I've used the more premium devices. Otherwise I would highly recommend people get the $700 version.

  Recently, I bought the 8GB/128GB version of the Surface Laptop Go. It's been a great purchase so far, but there are some quirks and annoyances sprinkled throughout its greatness. After using ThinkPads for years, the Surface Laptop Go combined with the Surface Dock 2 (and my usual peripherals) may have converted me.The positives:-Build quality (wonderful, even the plastic bottom cover feels premium)-The screen (resolution and DPI are fine, great brightness levels and colors, I much prefer the 3:2 aspect ratio for web browsing and documents aside from ultra-wide spreadsheets)-Lightweight and very portable (12.4"" is the perfect form factor for my needs)-Works great with the Surface Dock 2 (has replaced my Core i7 7700 desktop)-The keyboard is quite nice to type on-The trackpad feels great to use (not sure if it's mylar or glass, but it's wonderful)-The fingerprint sensor is quite nice for easy logins-Intel AX201 Wi-Fi card-RAM management is quite good on the 8GB models (I'm usually consuming 4-5GB)-UEFI/BIOS option to stop battery charging at 50% (perfect for my needs since I keep it connected to the Surface Dock 2 most of the time, this can easily be switched off)-No bloatware or junk programs out of the box (it's like the Microsoft/Windows version of using a Google Pixel phone)-I was able to upgrade my Laptop Go to Windows 10 Pro, so now I'm getting the full Windows 10 experience I'm used to-Surface devices have decent value retention (even broken older models go for decent prices on auction sites)The negatives:-Ships with S mode enabled by default (easy to turn this off, but it's annoying)-The keyboard isn't backlit (not a deal-breaker, but an annoyance in 2020)-The fan is loud when it ramps up, but it's usually fairly quiet (changing power modes helps)-There's no micro SD card slot (would be nice for storing music/movies or local file backups)-The 4GB/64GB eMMC model exists-Decent but not amazing value for the money (leaves you wanting more features the higher-tier models have)-It's a modern laptop with soldered RAM and a DIY SSD upgrade will probably void the warranty-The 16GB RAM model isn't readily available for consumers-It doesn't come in black (but the Platinum color I have is quite nice)-I really miss having a TrackPoint style device on the keyboardAs you can see, I can think of far more positives than negatives. Most of my negatives are either preferences or problems with modern laptops in general rather than the Laptop Go itself. Although I was drooling over some refurbished ThinkPads before buying the Laptop Go, it was hard to say no to a few of its main positives (mainly the screen, the trackpad, and the 3:2 aspect ratio).For its current asking price, I can highly recommend the 8GB/128GB  model if you turn off S mode, don't need a lot of storage space, and don't plan on playing tons of AAA games on it.

  First of all, i want to start by expressing how much i liked the product, its looks and feels like a solid midrange laptop for everyday use. The design is sleek and simple, i was disappointed with the fact that it is difficult to find a simple laptop that doesn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg. All in all i liked the laptop, a lot! *The rating is for the product* not the for the story belowHowever, the main purpose of this review is not about the laptop‚Äôs performance, design etc... its about how I got scammed and was sent a laptop with specs that I didn‚Äôt order.So the story goes like this, i get on amazon, I add a Microsoft surface laptop (i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) to my cart, i place the order, several days later I get the package, i set up the laptop started checking it out. I had a feeling that i should check out the computer‚Äôs spec, you know just curious. I was shocked when i found out that the specs of the laptop were (i5, 4 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD!!!!!!!) i was really confused, i double check the label on the back of the box and saw that it says (i5, 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD), but the laptop has different specs, and what is more confusing is that the serial number of the laptop matches the number on the box. So to me it seemed like it was an attempt to pull a quick one on me. I ended up returning the laptop of course... I am still disappointed that such scam attempts could happen on amazon!Check your laptops everyone! Don‚Äôt get scammed like i did.

  I‚Äôve been looking for a replacement for my 5-year-old MacBook Air and I think I may have finally found it in the Surface Laptop by Microsoft. There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I‚Äôve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I‚Äôve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where‚Äôs charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI‚Äôve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I‚Äôd already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn‚Äôt an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn‚Äôt take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI‚Äôve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that‚Äôs not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There‚Äôs some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there‚Äôs a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I‚Äôm not that worried about it, but just in case, I‚Äôll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I‚Äôm using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That‚Äôs it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would‚Äôve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would‚Äôve helped ‚Äúfuture-proof‚Äù the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it‚Äôs not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you‚Äôre traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It‚Äôs colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would‚Äôve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren‚Äôt the best for reading documents and websites. I don‚Äôt mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it‚Äôs not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn‚Äôt be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen‚Äîduh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you‚Äôre likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I‚Äôve used the touchscreen, it‚Äôs been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they‚Äôre still laptop speakers, but they‚Äôre some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much‚Äîmore than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360‚Äôs keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop‚Äôs. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It‚Äôs fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren‚Äôt making the switch is beyond me, but I think it‚Äôs a huge mistake. If you‚Äôre a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you‚Äôve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a ‚Äúpro‚Äù or ‚Äúgaming‚Äù laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that‚Äôs integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I‚Äôm really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I‚Äôve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can‚Äôt get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil‚Äôs advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don‚Äôt need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it‚Äôs definitely a compromise that‚Äôs understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won‚Äôt be that noticeable unless you‚Äôre frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I‚Äôm used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn‚Äôt even know Marvell made wireless cards. I‚Äôve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I‚Äôve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I‚Äôm getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can‚Äôt store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that‚Äôs true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they‚Äôd learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it‚Äôs a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there‚Äôs no other laptop I‚Äôd rather have right now.

  I work in IT so I get to see/touch and go through a lot of Windows PC's, Chromebooks and tablets.This is, by far, the best computer of any sort, Mac or otherwise, that I have ever touched, seen, owned or used. It's just perfect in every way.The hardware design is beautiful. It has a solidness to it that feels Apple or Mercedes quality. The screen is beautiful, touch, and it's fast.Battery life is great, performance is great, the keyboard has a perfect travel distance and click for those of us that are rapid typists-- you won't be disappointed.It has ""real"" usb connectivity which is so uncommon these days. The touchpad is glass and sensitive enough that I will use it. Previously Mac was the only computer with a good enough touchpad that I was willing/able to give up a wireless mouse.I could not be more pleased with this computer, I love it to the end of the world and back. I never thought I'd be considered a fanboy of any product, but here I am.

  I am mainly a Mac user, but certain programs such as Quicken and some software from my work just are better in their Windows versions, and using Parallels can be a bit irksome at times.  So I decided it would be nice to have a dedicated Windows machine.  This one is nice, neat and gets the job done.  As with most touch screens, the resolution is good but not great; touch interface can be a little off at times, and it would be nice to include a few more ports.  But overall, the build quality is excellent, battery life is good, and I am very satisfied.

  No, I wasn't let down by the laptop itself. Rather, I didn't even have the chance to be let down.I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife, whose 6-year-old Macbook Air needed replacing. I myself am a happy Surface Pro user (multiple generations) and a fan of what Microsoft has been doing with their OS and hardware.  So I convinced my wife to try the Laptop 2 -- I knew the Surface Pro or Surface Book wouldn't be what she needed, but the SL2 could be just the ticket.Especially based on reviews -- everyone gushed over how straightforward and effective this machine is, while being beautiful at the same time.So I order one for her. Have it shipped all the way to the Philippines. It takes a couple of weeks, and I'm all excited to get her moved to her new machine.  Finally, the box arrives.  She opens it, marvels at the industrial design of it, thanks me for her new toy. Then she hits the power button.And it goes into a Windows logo boot loop.  No other hint of activity -- no attempt to load the OS, no spinning circles, no booting into safe mode, no UEFI screen, not even a BSOD. Just that damned Windows logo boot loop.  I try all sorts of hard reset key combinations, spend hours creating recovery disks and trying to get the machine to run.  I spend hours chatting with Amazon reps and Microsoft reps. All sorts of little things go wrong, on top of this major letdown.In the end, the machine still won't run. Maybe the replacement on the way will be better. But as ""first"" experiences go (my wife's first with the new generation of Microsoft machines, and My first with the Laptop line) (and being a happy, happy customer of the Surface Pro line) -- this was incredibly, unendingly painful, and frustrating.Microsoft has no business shipping a $1000+ machine that doesn't even work out of the darned box.  This, for me, is a major burn as both a Microsoft and Amazon customer.Zero stars if I could give it, because I had pretty high expectations, and was severely let down.

  I waited for a month doing extensive research before jumping on to buying a new laptop! I do Photo Editing, Graphics Design, Coding, and Music. Software used are mostly all Adobe, Ableton Live and Heavy coding with a lot of npm installation. Well, after thorough research, It came down to Speed, Compact, Comfort, Ease of Use in terms of what I was looking at.  This new Laptop 2 check all of it including elegant and luxury design and buying this was the best decision ever made on a laptop purchase. The keyboard is so comfortable as to a level of taking my typing speed up a few notches, very clean and loudspeaker, sleek design, super slim, amazing screen and the touchscreen makes a huge difference when it comes to designing, navigating or using any kind of creative software, the craftsmanship on a laptop like never seen before and not to mention Matte Black is pure sexy! Yes, I bought Matte Black which I couldn't find on Amazon so leaving a review here as the specs are the same.Ôªø To anyone wondering, I installed Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Rush, Xd, Lightroom and used all of them. Did some run on regular use cases including designing, editing, saving and exporting and run blazingly fast in all of the apps.  I still can't believe this is packed with this much speed in such a slim design just next level !! Highly Recommend!

  ¬†I've had nothing but trouble with the Microsoft Surface 2 laptop I received.  I've had several blue screens of death.  Whenever I came back to it after not using it for a while it was unresponsive and required a reboot.  After several days of problems, I found a solution on the Internet, disable the Surface Intersil Ambient Light Sensor, see the attached video for how this works.  Also notice how much memory is freed up when this device is disabled.  The one star review is because you should not need to search for solutions like this for a new laptop.  I would have rather the computer be dead on arrival than partially working.

  I purchased this laptop to do a variety of tasks, including writing posts for blogs, as well as some design work in Illustrator and Photoshop. Typing on the keyboard is nice, nice level of noise and a pleasant amount of travel. I love the feel of the Alcantara fabric. It does make me cautious that my hands are clean since I'm unsure how well it'd hold up if I'm harsh to it. The square-ish screen dimensions of the Surface gives you a lot more screen space, but if you notice motion blur on monitors be cautious, the panel in this seems to have a slow response of some kind. Trackpad is solid, touchscreen is as well, and the speakers sound good. Fan noise is near non-existent unless you stress the machine, which if far enough can make it sound like a jet. Wish the charger was a block on the wall like you find with Apple machines of the Lenovo I owned previously, the portion between wall and power brick should be longer because it isn't long enough. All around a great machine, just short of perfect, but an absolute buy.

  This entire laptop series is designed around forcing you to buy more products. It is incompatable with almost anything that isn't microsoft. If you are willing to put some work in you could probably build a much more powerful laptop for about the same price as you will spend on this and the accessories for it. Its accessories are also garbage and will randomly cut off on you. Battery life lasts a few hours on Battery Saving mode.

  EDIT: Ya i got a bad model, but IMO Microsoft has more than enough money to make a laptop reliable especially as its competing with the most reliable laptop brand there is. The surface laptop isn't bad but it's not worth a thousand dollars or more when your own phone will likely out-live it. Also for the same price you can buy a laptop with almost twice the specs. Save your money don't support them and they'll have to get better if they want to compete.Update: it took about a month but they contacted me back. I have received a refund.  I will never purchase hardware from microsoft again. I will only support them through ms office and xbox. These laptops are too much design and way too little quality (minus aluminum case.) Expect a working model to work for only 2 years.Brand new started up kinda laggy and glitchy then suddenly I go through the start up process and change my wallpaper and everything seems kinda odd and slow for a brand new device.. so I go to restart it in a proper manner and boom. Now the screen glitches out and you cant do anything. Once you're able to log on with mininfreezes every 3 seconds and screen blinking, the desktop is empty and wont load any icons or even the task bar. Will stay like this for minutes and do nothing but blink on and off, and then most AMAZINGLY return to the log on screen. I lightly tap the underside of the laptop and notice the screen flicker more as I do it. It's like the hardware is so close together its touching and shorting out everywhere. I was hoping that microsoft would build laptops that actually do compete with apple but a quick google search shows 25 percent failure rates in microsoft laptops within 2 years, compared to 10 percent apple (leading competitor for qc and the surface laptop in my opinion.)

  I got the matte black lowest configuration 13.5"" for productivity purposes only. No gaming. I do plan on uploading a review video on my tech YouTube channel in case anyone is curious to know my user experience. But as the title says, so far so good, no issues. I will give it more time and will adjust my rating on this product accordingly if anything changes. The only thing that bothers me which also seems to be a common complaint regarding all surface products is the random adaptive brightness that you can't turn off. I've browsed many forums and other sources for solutions, people going as far as editing the registry... you should not have to jump through that many loops to toggle this display feature. Microsoft, PLEASE GIVE US THE ONE UPDATE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT. Other than that, I do like everything else about the Surface Laptop. Because I can't give half a star, I'm going to give 5/5 hoping Microsoft can just fix this one issue.

  Works good no problems. Matte black will show fingerprints easily but I don't care if you do get a different color. People complaining about the laptop being ""laggy"" need to change the power saver mode to performance the laptop auto sets it to save battery life which will make the computer slower. (This is on all Microsoft laptops now and has been for awhile) I would not recommend this for gaming thats not what it's intended for its a work laptop. If you want to play games get a desktop.

  Love this product. I got it in Matte Black, and I was expecting much worse for the finger print issue. This is very light and doesn‚Äôt bother me.I also have not experienced any lagginess as shown in other reviews. I have the i7 version.My screen does change brightness automatically from low to high without change in room, which is annoying but will get fixed soon hopefully.Overall, very stylish and capable, the keyboard and trackpad feels nice and I love the format of the screen (higher than your regular 13‚Äù).Also love being able to charge it with USB C! Tripled my battery life buying a 26000mah, 30W USB C charger. Many options available, got mine for 60$ with RAV.

  Buying this laptop was a bad mistake. I bought it in Jan and did not open it until late Feb / early march, I now realise that not opening it and checking the computer as soon as I received it was a huge mistake. When I did open it about 4 weeks later I realised it was faulty and now I'm stuck with the laptop as the refund option has disappeared from my Amazon purchase history.Upon turning on the laptop I noticed a thin blue vertical line on the left of the screen. I tried to find a solution on Google only to discover that the likely culprit is a hardware issue either with the display or graphics card. Today I logged into my Amazon account only to realise that the ""return/refund"" button is no longer there, so I am stuck with a new laptop that has a blue line down the screen. I tried to do a screen capture to show the blue line but the line does not appear in the screen capture, so this to me indicates that its the LED itself which is faulty. I have never heard of or seen this before. I decided to take some picture with my phone, here you will see the line, it looks black in the photos but its actually blue.Amazon or seller please help as I need this laptop replaced or refunded.

  When a mouse is plugged into a USB C hub the laptop just can‚Äôt handle it. The mouse lags and jumps around. Other laptops handle the hub fine, so I tried another hub and the same issue persists. Seems like I‚Äôll have to plug it in separately, defeating the purpose of USB C.

  I had a lot of hope switching from HP to Microsoft.  I thought that getting the top of the line laptop would be faster and have longer battery life.First off the packaging feels a bit flimsy and less durable.  It's definitely lighter from the HP 360 spectre I had, but it comes at a cost.My HP spectre was 10 years old intel i7, 512 gb SSD and 8 gb of ram and was running great, but after 10 years I thought I could use an upgrade.  After setting it up I noticed that it seemed a tick slower even with 24 gb of ram.  So I tested it and found out that the HP fired up faster to the home screen by 20 secs faster!I thought I can live with that if the battery lasted longer.  Guess what?  It doesn't.  I tested it from 100% that I get about 3.75 hours of battery before I have to plug it in.  That seems crazy off of what is stated!  After 10 years my HP matches the battery life.With that said, if you're going to buy a surface for speed and battery life try the AMD processor.  I would still feel a bit skeptical to be honest.I'm truly disappointed.

  The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15"" model is certainly an excellent laptop and an extremely credible alternative to other premium Windows-based laptops, AND MacBook Pros. My current workhorse is the 2019 16"" MacBook Pro, so let's compare the two here, despite there certainly being a price difference.1.) The aluminum chassis is stunning. It's incredibly minimalist. If you think Apple is minimalist with its MacBook line, Microsoft takes it to the next level. A solid mass of black (in this reviewer‚Äôs case), and ice cold to the touch.2.) Really lightweight at 3.4lbs, compared to 4.3lbs on the MacBook Pro 16. 2496 x 1664 (201ppi), - though not as good as on the MacBook Pro 16, (3072x1920, 226ppi), - still looks the part. Colors are not as vibrant as the MacBook Pro, only covering 75% DCI-P3 compared to 99% on the MacBook Pro, and the difference is really, really obvious. The display is certainly good, but in 2021 this isn't close to flagship. Throw in a pretty mediocre max screen brightness (380 cd/m2), this isn't great. The MacBook Pro 16"" will hit about 500cd/m2, and the difference side my side is staggering. It is a touch-screen, mind, but I‚Äôm still not convinced a touchscreen on a non-convertible laptop has tangible benefit to most users.The auto-brightness setup is very ‚Äújagged,‚Äù not a smooth fading up or down in brightness, - and I just turned this feature off as I found it very distracting.3.) The trackpad is responsive, though it‚Äôs pretty small compared to the MacBook. While I prefer the nice, physical trackpad click on the Surface, the MacBook‚Äôs trackpad allows you to ‚Äúclick‚Äù anywhere.4.) Port selection is really, really poor here. A single USB Type-A, a single USB Type-C, a headphone jack, and the Surface proprietary charging connector (something that really seems incredibly pointless, especially in 2021). No Thunderbolt ports of any sort here, which is a major oversight. Thankfully you can charge via the USB Type-C port so you don‚Äôt have to use the Surface proprietary port if you don‚Äôt want to.As an aside, setup of the Surface Laptop 4 is easy. Turn on, run through some initial setup, and you‚Äôre done pretty quickly. Bloatware is kept to a complete minimum, and I only found myself removing Microsoft 365 and a few other extraneous apps.5.) The keyboard is good. It‚Äôs not the best, a little spongier than the MacBook Pro 16‚Äôs, with a slower rebound, but still among the ‚Äúgood‚Äù keyboards on the market, - reasonably tactile. It has physical F-keys, something I wish I had on the MacBook Pro 16. I think the TouchBar is one of the worst things to happen to MacBooks (inadvertent touches are the worst!), so I hope Apple reverts to physical keys this coming year on their flagship system. Rumor has it they will.6.) Ergonomics are decent, though it‚Äôs actually a bit tricky to open the laptop as there‚Äôs no indent where you‚Äôre meant to flip the screen up, - a peculiar oversight. Bezels are a little large for 2021, but far from offensive.7.) Sound quality is not bad, but a far cry from the bass that the MacBook Pro 16 is able to generate. You could certainly listen to music here, but headphones would be preferred.8.) Battery life and thermals are absolutely fantastic, decimating the MacBook Pro for general usage, which is just a portable toaster. The laptop just runs remarkably cool with this AMD setup. That said, when the fans kick in, they kick in with a WHOOSH, which can be a bit disconcerting. Battery life is superb, easily giving me 8-11 hours for general web usage, a good 40% longer than my MacBook Pro doing the exact same things at a comparable brightness.‚Ä®‚Ä®9.) The SSD is nothing too special. While yes, any SSD is faster than not-an-SSD, this is on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of NVMe performance.Overall, I really enjoy the Surface Laptop 4, but it‚Äôs not hard to see where Microsoft could make some massive improvements and solidify the Surface line as THE Windows 10 systems to buy.4 out of 5. A worthy alternative to high-end laptops, but not yet at the top of its game.

  Did you notice that M$FT does not show a closeup of the keyboard? This is because it is so poorly designed that it is grossly error-prone and essentially unusable.Despite plenty of space to put another row of keys, they chose to put both the function keys (F1, F2, F3) and the control keys (Home, End, PgUp, PgDn) on one row. This means that each key has two functions depending on whether the Fn key at the bottom of the keyboard is activated or not. If it is off, the keys have their control function. If it is on, they are the function keys.To add to the design stupidity, the Fn key has a tiny light to indicate whether it is on or off, but it does not stay on. It goes out after about 20 seconds of inactivity. Are they saving a few nano-watts? The same is true of the Caps Lock key.If you forget whether you left the Fn key on or off and you press what you think is Page Down, you may actually get F11. Depending on which application you are in, that could be disastrous. Or, if you meant to press F7, you might actually get PrtScr (Print Screen).It‚Äôs difficult to image how something this bad could have gotten through the design and testing process, but it did. Not only that, but they are not on Surface Book 3 and they have carried this disaster forward since the original release.Do not buy any version of this laptop until they fix this glaring design flaw.

  It‚Äôs not bad, but it is definitely not good.I don‚Äôt know if it is the specific laptop or the surface book 2 in general are like that. But the PC is weak!Sometimes the laptop would suddenly shut down for no reasons and I have to wait until the battery is off and it closed.Then recharged it and it opens.

  The laptop itself is great.

  Maybe a slight problem here or there but a restart generally fixes it. Amazing build quality, bought from a 3rd party to get the price down (saved about $600 on the 256gb performance base model) and would definitely recommend for the mac level build quality/aesthetic and the Microsoft level of customization. Even in my first free weeks of classes I have found myself utilizing its tablet mode and easy to use note taking apps and features, it's keyboard and trackpad are some of the nicest I've used also and adds to the ""deluxe factor"" of this device.

  Magnificent machine with plenty of power and superb performance. I bought this so that I would be able to run Adobe Photoshop wherever I went. I have not been disappointed! I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy the machine is built while still maintaining an elegant style. Though I might have done better to go with the top tier to get the most memory, this tier still works wonderfully for all the processes I use on Adobe Photoshop. The battery life is wonderful and I haven't run out of it when I've been on the go. I'll update this review with any changes but so far, definitely five stars and definitely worth the money!

  I've been purchasing the Surface Laptops for my company and they always came with Windows 10 Pro S, which I easily converted to regular Windows 10 Pro.  Unfortunately I missed the part that says these come with Windows 10 HOME S.  Now I have to purchase the upgrade.  I feel like it's a ""Gotcha sucka"" moment.  Typical Microsoft.  Ugh....

  This laptop is for people who need to be able to whip out their computer and type on the fly. I cannot stress enough that the Surface Laptop 2 has THE BEST LAPTOP KEYBOARD on the market. If you're an impulsive writer, go to a lot of meetings, or need to take fast-paced notes in school, this is absolutely for you. The incredible (and I mean seriously incredible) display and touch screen are a huge bonus.You will, however, compromise on performance. The small form factor seriously limits the thermal integrity of the machine, meaning that whether you try to pack an i7 or an i5 in there, you're going to get some serious throttling. This does, however, also make for incredible battery life.I highly recommend the i5 8Gb config. You absolutely do not need the i7 model, as the form factor significantly limits its performance. If you're looking for something that can handle more intensive workloads, this is not the laptop for you. It's also ABSOLUTELY not for gaming.Overall, the average user won't regret this one. It's extremely versatile, and it'll get you through a few years of school. Expect to depreciate over 3 years if you're buying it for your business. I love the thing, and I'm really picky about computers.

  I bought this a couple days ago and was very excited when it came in. Had read up on reviews through amazon and reddit and thought I knew what to expect. However, the alcantera fabric gets too dirty for my liking. Its comfortable, its stylish, but its not durable. After 2 days of EXTREMELY light use, i could see my palm prints in the fabric. I used a damp paper towel and they came off. However, I don't want to worry about that every day for the rest of the laptops life. The battery life was also meh. I was expecting a good 10 hours of light browsing, I got around 5. The price of this product is pretty steep and I couldn't justify it, taking the things above into consideration. Back to laptop hunting!

  I had to purchase a laptop that can handle my everyday work + school. Mainly using word and opening disc/thumb drives. Yet... this laptop has failed so often that I simply cannot give it a good review. I like the design though. The images are just some of the times that it crashed out of 20 times so far. Less than a week of use too. All updates are confirmed and yet.... Fails.

  the two best things about this laptop are the battery life and the size. the laptop will last me through two school days on a single charge and easily fits inside my backpack with all my other stuff. the only issue is the fact that there is no USB c port, real bummer because I can't use any third-party dongles but overall I love this laptop and would definitely recommend for schoolEDITmy screen has recently started turning yellow and I have been trying for 3 days now to get in contact with Microsoft on their website but it won't let me fill out the support ticket to get the laptop replaced. after a quick google search I discovered that surfaces have a 25% failure rate after 2 years of use, I will update this if I ever get the website to workEDIT 2I finally got ahold of customer support and they were really friendly, I got them to create a service order in under a few minutes, new laptop on the way YAY.

  After 1 year. I was having problem with the batter with the laptop on and off for a year however!!! I contacted the seller and the dude was so cool. He shipped me a new one and didn't ask me to take my time and ship back the old bad battery which is good because I didn't have to invest time packaging it. COOL DUDE. GOOD TO do business with. I appreciate his help and the battery came fast and fix the issue! Appreciate that he solved this issue for me. Made my day.

  Okay so I literally just turned this laptop on a few hours ago and it turns into a log in screen. There's no set up screen at all. And it asks for a password so I can't use my laptop at all. Now I have to return it and get a new one which I'm going to get somewhere else. Perfect. I never review products so I hope that means something.

  The Surface Laptop 2 is one of the best laptops I‚Äôve seen on the market. Spec wise it‚Äôs a higher end laptop similar to the MacBook Pro lineups, but beyond that the Surface seemed like the better buy for a couple of reasons.PROS:- Beautiful touchscreen display: This stands out when comparing it to the MacBook Pro. The display between the Mac and the Surface is very similar but touch capability makes it easier than being limited to the touchpad only. I have to say my hand tends to stay on the touchpad anyways but the option of swiping or tapping the screen can make certain tasks easier to do. The laptop has decent brightness if you are working outdoors, although like pretty much any laptop you shouldn‚Äôt be working on it in direct sunlight for the best results.- Amazing performance: I personally haven‚Äôt compared the Surface Laptop 2 side by side to the MacBook Pro to get a decent comparison but the Surface definitely gets the job done. Whether I‚Äôm video editing or browsing the web the Surface runs all of these programs smoothly. With at least 8GB of ram you can run several tasks at once without any delay, it stood up to just about everything I threw at it. As long as you‚Äôre not hardcore gaming on it the laptop runs smoothly- Amazing design: The design has stayed the same from last years model. The metal design on the outside of the laptop gives it a very smooth finish and premium feel. The laptop also has the alcantara fabric around the touchpad and keyboard which makes typing on the laptop easier on your wrists. Along with the design the laptop is fairly light and easy to carry around without too much effort.NEUTRAL:- Battery life: The battery life is decent on the laptop. With the high end processor and display it makes sense why the battery doesn‚Äôt meet up to some people‚Äôs expectations. I can get through a solid 6 - 7 hours of web browsing and occasional videos on a single charge. The charging cable for the laptop is compact so bringing it along shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.CONSThunderbolt 3 and USB-C: Despite the features on this laptop it lacks Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ports. Although it‚Äôs basically an upgrade from last years model it would have been nice if they implemented both of these in the laptop, but personally it isn‚Äôt a deal breaker.Windows 10 Home: This laptop comes with Windows 10 Home, not the Pro version. This isn‚Äôt any issue for me as much since I don‚Äôt use any of the extra features the pro version provides. But BEWARE, this comes with Windows 10 Home.OVERALL:This laptop should suite most people in their day to day tasks. The performance should meet or exceed your expectations if you have a laptop older than 4 years so if you‚Äôre looking for an upgrade this is definitely worth the buy. Keep an eye out for sales on the Surface Laptop 2 to get a even better deal for an amazing laptop!

  Got my Surface Laptop 2, I5/8GB RAM/265GB aaaand...returned it.First, fit and finish are tight. No complaints there. Lack of USB-C was a bit of a thing, but I decided to try anyway. Display was beautiful, another non-complaint.Main reasons for giving it the boot was:1. Battery life. The SL2 struggled to give me 7 hours no matter how I configured it. Less than people were reporting and waaaay less than Microsoft advertised.2. Slow. With the chip and RAM inserted, everything should have been faster.3. Performance. Could not get it to play movies in any app or player without severe hiccuping/studdering.When the performance and battery life is on par with the Surface Go, the laptop had to go. Maybe I got a lemon, but I also read about how the SL2 was non-user fixable or upgradable. You can‚Äôt even replace a dying battery. Opening it up is impossible without destroying it. Everything inside is glued, soldered or spot welded down. Microsoft even admitted that due to the way the devices are constructed, any problems result in the laptop being junked. Not very eco-friendly.

  I loved my 1st Gen Surface Laptop (i5 processor, 8gb ram, 128gb solid state) and I was pumped to try the 2nd gen with i7 processor and double the memory:  Unfortunately, I found it disappointing. It seems to have less battery life, is more laggy, and definitely NOT any quicker. (I‚Äôm using it for business purposes with 3-5 programs @ a time: word, excel, adobe, chrome- > 5 tabs). The 2nd gen did not seem to out perform the 1st in anyway, thus not worth the additional cost. Also, it seemed more sensitive to hot and cold. Ultimately, I had to return because (the icing on the cake was that) in 3 weeks I was never able to get the 2nd gen to back up from my external hard drive- maybe I got a lemon.TL;DR 2nd gen is not worth the $, save it for the next unit with (hopefully) actual/material upgrades. Also be aware that SURFACE LAPTOPS WERE NOT MADE TO BE REPAIRED. Thus, if there is a problem outside the 1yr warranty- you can‚Äôt fix it. You‚Äôll have to buy new or pray that Microsoft will side with you on the defects *cough, not likely*.

  I searched for a laptop for school for several weeks, combing through hundreds of reviews and types. I decided on this one based on overall price point and reviews. Overall, this is an awesome laptop. It charges really fast and the battery life is pretty good. I love that it starts right up and recognizes your face as soon as you open it. It is durable and super fast. I use it mainly for taking exams, Microsoft office, and other things for school. I love the draw feature on it especially for lectures. You don‚Äôt really need the stylus pen. Overall, I have been pleased with this laptop and would definitely recommend it especially for the price point. It is super quiet and light weight as well!

  I upgraded to this from the original surface book (i5 128gb, 8g ram). The main reason for the upgrade was to add a USB-C hub to run presentation displays and rj-45 lan lines through. This one also doubled the storage and updated CPU.The screen is brilliant, very responsive (touch) and clean/crisp (visually). Facial recognition is effective. The smart pen is precise (using the one that came with the original surface book). The keyboard on surface books is a major selling point vis-a-vis the generic surface 2-in-1. This thing is a solid base with an extra battery. The touch pad is the best I've every experienced (same with the original surface book). It reminds me of a macbook. It's very responsive but also very sturdy without any of the unintentional touches or palm touches that I experience on other laptops and folio covers.The only down side - and this is incredibly annoying - is that there's only one USB-C connector on the keyboard base. It's located right next to the proprietary surface link. I want multiple USB-C interfaces. I don't need multiple USB-A. It's 2020. USB-C has become the standard for portable devices. Even the USB-C hubs only come with like 1 USB-C (for charging) and multiple USB-A. Again, we've entered a new decade. Let's evolve a bit, eh? How long has USB-C been out and we're still relying on adapters for backward compatibility on new equipment.I rarely detach the screen to go tablet mode, but I love that I can, and when I do use it that way, it's amazing. I'd do it more often if the rooms I work in had decent screen mirroring software.

  Loving it so far. The one thing I would complain about is the battery life. It hasn‚Äôt lived up to the specs. And when the screen/tablet is detached, in tablet mode, the battery life of that element is far lower than I would have expected. Could be my settings and cpu usage from background processes or something else. I would like to know how they spec-ed out the battery live because I haven‚Äôt been pushing it hard with high cpu usage.Welcome to recommendations if anyone has them.But the machine itself is fantastic performance-wise and has an equal build quality to a MacBook Pro. Maybe better because it‚Äôs a MSFT machine so it‚Äôs far mor compatible to peripherals.Great machine. Just wish the battery life was better with my config.

  Owned this machine for 2 months and during use shutdown on it's own and would not power up again. Contacted ASUS support to find out I had to pay for the shipping to return a unit that is under warranty. This is the last ASUS product I will buy. The warranty details are not available from the Amazon site  , so it you don't take the time to go and read the manufacturer's warranty on their site you fall prey to substandard warranty practices.

  I wanted to buy my mom a laptop since her 10 year old Toshiba finally failed. I was looking at all the options out there, but everything in my budget range was either way too slow. All she does is watch movies and surf the web, youtube, etc., so I wanted to find her a laptop that was particularly keen for those type of tasks. I started looking into Chromebooks. Mind you, this was the very first Chromebook that I've purchased, so I didn't know what to look for when it comes to specs. I mean, lets face it-when it comes to specs, Chromebooks that are out on the market right now has some very weak specs. But dont be fooled by the unimpressive numbers. Chromebooks use Chrome OS which was developed by Google. They use a completely different user interface than, say Microsoft or Apple. Chrome OS uses significantly less resources, therefore your computer runs very fast, even with low specs. For example, my mom's old Toshiba had an 10 year old Intel Celeron processor, 8 GB of ram, 500 GB HDD.  Nothing too impressive, just an average laptop. This Toshiba took about 4 minutes to boot up. When it comes to surfing the web, watching YouTube, etc., it was an absolute pain! This ASUS Chromebook has similar, or even weaker specs: Intel Celeron processor, 4 GB ram, 32GB storage. You would be wondering why on earth would anyone get a computer that has such weak spec sheet? Don't be fooled. I was skeptical too when I first purchased this Chromebook. The laptop is able to boot up in 7 seconds. Thats right, 7 SECONDS!!! The entire setup of the laptop took less than 2 minutes. All you have to do is log in using your wifi information and Gmail account. Everything else sets up automatically. The user interface was really simplistic, even a kid could operate it. It makes sense as to why it only has 32GB of storage. You store all your documents on Google's cloud. All the apps you could possibly ever want is included: Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Drive, etc. In my mom's case, all she does is watch YouTube, so this is the perfect laptop for that. Not to mention, it is incredibly thin! It almost looks like a MacBook Air from far away. The Chrome OS updates your computer discretely so you don't have to worry about the hassle of updating your laptop or be alerted to do so. You also dont get any viruses on Chromebooks too since Google has your back with their security features.  All in all this is a fantastic laptop for the price. My mom has been using it for a couple days now and she absolutely loves it! In fact, she tends to baby it by covering it up with the packing sleeve after every use. LOL!

  I do.  I absolutely love this device and I am so glad I bit the bullet and bought one.  I have had it for a few weeks now and I don't miss my Windows laptop one single bit.  I was worried that my laptop had features with which a Chromebook could not compete.  I haven't come across any.Chromebooks do not come with optical drives or a hard drive with a ton of space.  You also can't load third party software such as MS Office or TurboTax.  There simply isn't the space or computing power to do so, not to mention the OS to support it.Chromebooks do come with the Chrome OS, browser and the ability to download apps from Google Play.  Onboard storage is limited to 16 - 64 GB but Chrome is fully integrated with Google Drive (unlimited storage) and you can easily use an SD card or a thumb drive so you can access files offline.  They also have considerably more battery time than a conventional laptop.  You can easily use the online version of MS Office if your account is associated with a licensed copy of MS Office or you can subscribe to Office 365 and most software applications you would use (e.g. Turbotax) have web-based versions as well.Anyway, back to the review of the ASUS C523.  Its a great device.  The C523 has a full 15.6 inch display so it ""looks"" like any full size laptop.  It is fully integrated with all of my Google resources...mail, Google Drive, Youtube and I can access content from Netflix via the Chrome browser or the app.  I can store files locally if I want but I usually just save them to Google Drive.  Its very portable and light so I can move with as easily as a spiral notebook.  The thing that really wows me is that it is ""instant on"".  I don't have to wait for some convoluted boot process...I open the lid, type my PIN and I am in with no delay.  Updates are done in the background and I have not had to do a reboot yet because of one.  It intefrated with my (wireless) printer in a snap...I have not tried USB connecting the printer so I don't know if that would work.The only negative thing I have to say is regarding battery life.  ASUS says you can get up to 10 hours of battery life.  That is not true.  There is nothing that you can do on this device that is economical enough to get you to 10 hours of battery life.  I would say you can count on about 5 hours MAX if you are just surfing the internet or watching Netflix and the display brightness is kept as low as possible. I usually have to plug it in shortly after four hours; still better than my laptop.

  I always like to start with something positive, and I will.  Overall the device looks great, the size is perfect, the keyboard feels good, and the performance seemed more than adequate.  Asus seemed to do a good job of putting together a reasonably priced chromebook that would be suitable for most people.  Where they missed the boat big time was on the display.  It was so washed out and grainy that I'm not totally sure there wasn't something wrong with the model I received.  If that display quality is indeed part of their specs and design, then I strongly urge you to consider something else.  After using it for 15 min it began to give me a headache...it was that bad.  My other chromebook is an Asus C302 flip, and I couldn't be happier with it.  I was expecting a similar experience for this newer 14"" model.  I purchased it for my wife, and unfortunately I'm sending it back tomorrow.  The display is simply so bad that neither she nor I can use it.

  I just recently bought it a week ago. I am very happy with it. Very light, user friendly and it‚Äôs basically a affordable business laptop. If you looking for something affordable, great for surfing YouTube or websites or for classes this is the one. I haven‚Äôt tried gaming on it so no idea. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.

  Before I begin I must add that I'm a big Chromebook fan boy. I have a Chromebook as my main computer. I bought this and another computer for my siblings as xmas presents and now they think I have favorites. Why? Because the other Chromebook, despite being the same price (if you must know, Acer Chromebook 11) feels and functions better and faster. This ASUS Chromebook looks cool, but the moment you pick it up and feel it buckle under its own weight, you easily realize it's too cheap. I was hoping to give them both a similar device just different colors. Nope. At this price point there are WAAAAY better Chromebooks available. Avoid this one unless you see it at a heavy discount. I would only recommend this specific Chromebook if the price falls to $120.Update: it's been a year of my sibling using this daily for high school and it still works. I've bought him a better computer and this this red Asus has been relegated to a beater computer I take with me when I don't feel like taking my expensive laptop somewhere (pixelbook).It gets the job done, I can't deny it that. I still think there are better options (especially now in 2019), but a year of heavy use has proven that in a pinch, this little red computer works fine.

  I purchased this chromebook for use in college and light recreational use. I have had it almost a week now.Pros:- clear, high definition picture & screen- long lasting battery (I used it for about 6 hours straight and it only drained about 25% of the battery on low light)- lightweight- compact, perfect for desk or lap use- adequate processor, loads fastCons:- the body/material isn't entirely durable, but that is to be expected given the low cost. I haven't dropped it yet but it may not hold up if I were to.- Chromebook's google docs app (offline, not via chrome browser) is a bit bulky, doesn't offer the same ""print"" appearance as online mode- not the fault of asus or chromebook, but you cannot use Microsoft products without paying for office

  Ive had this chromebook for over 2 months and it works amazing . Doesnt crash , , turns on everytime I need to use it which is everyday & great battery life and beautiful color . The only thing about the laptop is that it came with a dent which i dont understand why because it was purchased as new and it was wrapped in the box very well . Camera never works neither

  My 13"" MacBook Pro is my usual day-to-day machine, but I wanted something inexpensive and, most importantly, small and light, to take traveling to Europe. At less than $200 and around 2 lbs, this fit the bill. CPU, RAM, and storage are all sufficient for everything I want to do -- Gmail, Spotify, Google Docs, browsing -- without straining or bogging down. Paired with the TeckNet Bluetooth Mouse (also from Amazon) I have a secure, portable, and very usable traveling setup. And, should it get lost or stolen somewhere on the road, my data is safe on Google's servers, and it won't break the bank to replace it.Although I gave the individual review items -- material, sound, battery life -- each 4 stars (fine, but not great), the total package is a solid 5 star offering. An astounding amount of computer for the price, and 100% recommended if the Chromebook computing model meets your needs.

  I was looking for something to replace my mid-2012 Mac book pro that ended up having problems with the latest up date. I didn't want to deal with it anymore than I had already have. Needless to say I just wasn't a huge fan of the computer to begin with. So I went looking for some to replace it with. After really thinking about what I use my computer for I was steered to Chromebooks. I basically shop online, use it to write notes once in awhile, watch Netflix's/hula and surf the net. Not needing something super crazy I found this guy. It's RED!!! Not the most important reason I got it. This Chromebook does all I want it to and fast. No crazy start up, has a very long battery life and most importantly its easy to navigate. Plus it wasn't a budget breaker. I'm not disappointed with my choice.

  The sound is pretty decent, I think it was better than my bigger laptop I had previously. Very easy to use, AppStore is a bit slow but no problems. Battery life is good!

Of course you won‚Äôt get Great quality for gaming or anything beyond. It‚Äôs definitely meant to type, so this is perfect for a college-high school student. If I could add one feature, it would be keyboard light up!!!Recommend it so far!!:)

  We bought this for my son as a gift and it wouldn‚Äôt even run chrome os. When we turned it on there was an error screen to recover the chrom os using our own computer. After spending an hour or so trying to install the recovery system on a usb to plug into the brand new chrome book to recover its operating system we got an error message. I was under the impression that chrome os came standard on the chrome book? Ended up being extremely disappointed and never able to get past the error screen.

  I researched this on the Asus website which implies that all models include a stylus, but that turns out not to be the case. On this model, there is a plastic cover where the stylus would normally go. Someone asked this here as a question but I noticed too late, unfortunately. Asus support was not helpful when I reached out to see if a stylus could be added.In the brief time I had this, it did seem well constructed but the screen did not impress. It could be that I'm just used to more expensive laptops though. At this price, I am going to wait until the 2nd-generation Lenovo 500e is in stock and try that instead.

  I bought this for my mom, and I am legitimately jealous. I have a $1,000 Google Pixelbook and I would rather have this. The Pixelbook still works, but the screen is cracked and the frame is bent.

My mom had a Nook that stopped working, and this is the perfect replacement.My favorite thing about it is the rugged exterior, it just feels durable when you hold it.

  Pros:- Easy to setup (IMHO) and use- Starts up/wakes up very quickly- Long battery life- Light - easy to carry in a purse or backpack- Has charger ports on both sidesCons:- VERY low speaker volume. Be prepared to have to use earphones for movies, shows and games. So low I considered sending it back, but I mainly use this in class/at my internship or when I'm in bed and the hubs is asleep and I'm wearing earphones anyway, so not a huge issue currently.- The bezel around the screen is really thick and makes it hard to click on tabs in my browser to close them - usually takes me a few tries each time, and I don't have large fingers.- The screen looks and feels kind of cheap. Not sure how to explain further, that's just my impression. Using the it as a touchscreen has been a good experience, though. It's very responsive and you can adjust its sensitivity. The only issue that limits its functionality is the thick bezel. On the bright side, the thickness may help protect the screen when it's dropped.- This is a criticism of the Google Chromebook operating system in general, not of ASUS. If you're expecting to be able to run all apps from the Google Play store, especially games, you're going to be disappointed. Quite a few games won't play on mine. Also, some Google apps are pretty pointless to download because the Chromebook version of the app is harder to use than the website version. Example: I never use Google Drive app and other apps like Google Doc on my Chromebook because I don't like the way the app looks and functions on it. The same apps look and behave differently on my Pixel 3 phone.- Doesn't come with a stylus. I realized after the fact that you have to go with a different product listing that's about $50 more to get the stylus.This is a good computer to use for work/school note-taking and leisure stuff like watching shows or playing games (the ones that will work on it, that is....). I wouldn't buy this if it were going to be used as my primary computer (I also have a desktop), but I got it for taking notes in my grad classes and at my internship, so it works for me right now. If I didn't have a desktop I probably would have gone with a Surface Pro or a larger, Google-brand Chromebook.

  This is a nice solid product.  I just wanted a device to read emails and surf the web.  I have a Samsung S9+ so thought it would be a nice complement to the phone.  (I use my Dell desktop for serious work, like writing this review.) The reason for my low review is this Chromebook is it is very temperamental.  I spend about as much time trying to get it to work as I do using it.  Keypad works sometimes, other times does not.  Very frustrating that the Chromebook requires a password, I cannot opt out of using one.  So when it turns on and requires a PW, but the KB does not work, have to spend time trying to get the KB to work.  Open/close, ON/OFF, reset options - usually something finally works, but not always the same thing.  The on screen KB will not show up when the PW is required.  So I've learned to never let it shut down, just try to keep it in the sleep mode.

  We bought this for my daughter for Christmas (purchase date 11.29). She was SO excited on Christmas morning! She was No issues until early June when the touchscreen went a little wonky and would respond and then wouldn't. However, that seemed to resolve itself. Now, as of July 2nd, it will not power on and the charging light isn't even coming on (though it was this AM). I researched how to resolve things (hart reset, etc.) but to no avail. I'm SO frustrated for my daughter because she is VERY protective of her electronics. We are all befuddled as to what happened.So, I can't recommend this ASUS Chromebook model. I'm looking into how to get a power cord to see if that is the problem (versus the laptop itself). I'm hoping so because 7 months on a $400 piece of technology is totally unacceptable.

  Likes - Chromebook that can run Android apps. Screen resolution is good enough to watch Netflix. I dropped it the second day I had it, and it didn't break, unlike the last Chromebook I purchased.Dislikes - Will not run either the United app or the Prime Video app, so my only option to watch stuff on the plane is to download Netflix videos.

  After going to numerous stores in my local area and having no luck due to the Covid 19 pandemic, my daughter and I searched here on Amazon. We looked at many but came to this one. I want to say it took maybe 5 mins to set up for her I haven't had to touch it again since. She has had no issues with basic use of internet browsing or screen/file navigation. The laptop is also light weight and and slim which makes me feel better about when she is carrying it around the house to get from one room to another. I want to thank the seller as well because even though the shipping said it was going to be 5-7 days before arrival, we received it within in 2-3 days/the Prime shipping usual time frame.

  Currently using this small laptop for basic notes, web searching, studying, and small video watching on the web.  I downsized from a 17‚Äù laptop to this one for easier and lightweight travel.  Spacewise it‚Äôs great and screen is readable (with option to change text letter sizes as most computers can).  I haven‚Äôt opened up the hood of the laptop to see if it‚Äôs customizable, but for storage wise I would consider getting an external HD so you can store all your files.

  There is nothing wrong with the Asus brand.  The problem lies in the very restrictive S mode.  This a ""straight jacket"" for Microsoft.  You are sent to the Microsoft store for everything.  Chrome will not even load.  Had I known (advertisement doesn't say this laptop is an S mode.), I would never have bought this computer.  Displeased is an understatement!!

  Lightweight, great battery life, and a windows machine. I was looking for a PC that was more in line with the configuration of a chromebook but with windows. This fits my needs exactly. Documents, spreadsheets, and internet searches are what I'll use if for. Setup was easy. I added several apps to the machine and still have half of the solid sate disk space. I already had all of the peripherals such as a hard drive, DVD drive, and SD card adapter. I don't foresee using the 2 drives very much but doing backups or transports on flash drives. The speed of the machine is very acceptable and after using it for several days I'm very satisfied that it will meet my needs completely. I haven't really tested how much run time I'll get on the battery will last with all of the apps but doing documents on battery doesn't seem to eat up the time very much.

  This is a truly terrible computer. Its slow, it looses the internet connection every 20-30 minutes. You can only use Microsoft's mediocre web browser, it won't let you download Chrome or anything else. Web browser crashes regulalry or just disappears for no reason. I bought this as a second computer to help us through the Coronavirus work at home disaster and will toss it out the window as soon as I can go back to my office. On a positive note it is thin enough that it can be used as a doorstop.Note: writing this review on my phone because the computer can't handle having gmail and amazon.com open simultaneously.

  I use it for office 365 and gaming. Unfortunately i can't actually keep more than one tab open with certain games, including Minecraft Java Edition. If it had more space and more RAM then it would definately be a better computer. i also have movies i want to download and it keeps notifying me that i need more space. Soon i should be getting one with 128 gb. Not a bad starter computer but if you go to walmart you can find better quality for the price.****UPDATE****The mousepad stopped working after 10 months, also very fragile and one of the rubber stoppers on the bottom fell off. One of the USB ports didn't work with my iPhone when i wanted to download music. The system takes up more than half of the space. Looking into a return now but ASUS hasn't contacted me back.

  It ran slow at the initial startup with the system it ran which was Cortana. When I thought it was off with a blank screen it wasn't and drained the battery. I had to charge if after I turned it on,  which means I had to turn it off. This happened twice after it started it. Around the third time, there was a notification that said the system needed to be updated to the Windows 10, I downloaded it, now it doesn't come on at all! The charging light comes on but cuts off when I attempted to power on but there is no on screen. I tried the reset button which was the power button holding the power button for 5-10-15-20 or 40 seconds and neither got the computer on as recommended. Maybe with the version of Microsoft 10 and Vivobook wasn't compatible. It does have a neat size and appearance.

  For those that aren't aware: S mode will only let you download from the microsoft store so other web browsers and 3rd party apps like Zoom will not be usable unless you turn off S mode which will slow your computer down. This cannot be turned back on and switching it off slows/increases boot time and lowers battery performance

  Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6"" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!

  This is the only ultra-book I could find with a 64gb ssd, 4gb RAM, weighed only 2 pounds (actually 2.1) and cost $200.  If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this.The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs.I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded.WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5"" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen.I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy.I have been unable to get anything near the ""whole day"" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good.Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful.  Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway.

  I bought this on Prime day to replace an android tablet. Wanted something a little more capable, yet portable. I installed several Linux distros without a hitch. Settled on Mint 19. It's rock stable and runs smooth as butter. I added a 200gb micro sd for data storage and have a 2 tb slim USB HD for more extensive things like video. I haven't found much that this mighty mouse will not do. If you need am inexpensive portable Linux machine, look no further.All you kind folks having winows problems on this laptop, save yourself a boat load of headaches and jump off the Microsoft bandwagon. Try linux.  Mint is a great place to start. It will easily handle your web, office and email. I have even edited photos with the (free) equivalent of Photoshop and Lightroom  ... GIMP and Darktable. I understand that there is a place for Windows et al on a more capable machine, but for something this light and portable I have not found a better way to go.

  I was sent an L203MA. From the first moment, the touchpad was weird.  It only was accurate when I started the curser when my finger was 1/2 inch from base of the track pad. Now that may have fixable software problem, but the downloaded driver files specific to this model would not work with it as recommended by ASUS as a possible fix.  Now that problem was nothing compared to my main complaint. The From the manufacturer description in Amazon said that this model came with a backlit keyboard. In the ASUS FAQ and later confirmed by the ASUS Chat representative, it did not. I am returning this unit today.  I have never given a one star rating and am doing this to make sure that others be aware of the inaccurate description provided in the item‚Äôs description.

  *** edit  5/18I reduced my original 3 star review to 1 stars today. I hate this laptop, it's total garbage. Along with all the problems I initially listed, the screen haphazardly changed sizes when you move the trackpad a certain way. It's not that it's accidentally increased the size where you can zoom it back down to 100% (which wouldn't be tolerable in a brand new laptop either) but it actually moves everything on the screen over slightly to the right when it increases, to where you can no longer see the far right of the screen. You can try to zoom the size down, but it just makes everything smaller - things are still off center and then too small to read. I can't believe a brand new laptop has so many problems.The calculator keeps popping on out of nowhere, maybe that has something to do with the number pad coming on randomly? I just can't with this thing. I started a return but it isn't sold through Amazon so it wasn't easy peasy and I'm in the process of waiting 48 hours for the seller to approve my return. I had hoped to drop it off at the UPS store yesterday, which usually initiates a refund as soon as scanned in and get another computer before the weekend. Not going to happen since I'm waiting on my return to be approved. Do not buy this computer. My previous ASUS I had loved so much had been a Vivobook and I had spent $400 after skimming through my 2016 order history. I skimped $100 and it definitely shows.end edit***First thing I noticed out of the box is this laptop is not pink. It's rose gold and kinda ugly. However, I didn't buy it because it was pink, I bought it because my favorite laptop in the last decade was an ASUS at a similar price point. Maybe the other one was $400... Regardless I was crushed when my cat dumped a cup of coffee on it. I haven't loved another lap top since, so I decided to get another ASUS.This is the  first time I've had this new number key pad on the track pad before. This would be ingenious if it didn't turn on randomly and have difficulty turning it off and on when you actually want to. I've already had this problem goof up several paid tasks that I've done today.Another drawback is the system speakers are way too quiet. I tried streaming something last night and even after changing the system sound all the way up, I was having trouble hearing my show over the t.v. in the other room, which has never  been an issue with other computers.The screen quality is pretty poor too. It's fine unless you are streaming something and it looks terrible.I'm sadly going to be returning this most likely. I can live with the ugly color, but I don't think I can live with the track paid dysfunction and the sound and screen quality.

  As someone who works with technologies daily across a broad stratosphere of operating systems and equipment (Windows, macOS, iOS, Ubuntu and a myriad of other Linux flavors) - I have to say that this is my favorite ""tech thing"" I've bought.  I was really on the fence.. and the price was a bit steep for to me was a top-of-the-line-Android-phone-without-a-phone, but I kept on reading the reviews and seeing the press so I had to at least try one.I own 2 Microsoft Surface Notebooks (love them both too), a MacBook Pro & a MacBook Air, and a few desktops running various Linux derivatives.  They are useful for very different things.  I work in CG quite a bit, and for pure horsepower in a laptop the Microsoft Surface's are definitely the way to go (built in higher end nvidia GPUs).  Pure horsepower for pure horsepower's sake can best be done at a desktop, but I like working from a laptop moreso than sitting at a desk all day.  Having a full scale OS works great for certain things and a Chromebook will never be a full laptop replacement for that reason.But this is what the Chromebook can do that not even a good iOS device can do: speed, speed, speed on ""routine"" tasks (email, web, Asana, Evernote, etc).  It works - like an android phone - in that opening up gets you right to work.  Even an iOS device with a lock code or face recognition process (or thumbprint or whatever) will cause a near minute delay in getting down to work.This is important for a VERY important reason for me - at least.  I still find that a pencil and pen, up until this purchase, was simply the quickest way to jot a note.  No longer - I can type more legibly than I can write and with this device being simply wicked fast, I can open it up and I have Asana, Evernote and Google Keep open all the time and they just let me jot something down.  This is Chromebook's ""killer app"" is that it just works, and works quickly.Specific to this model, the Asus Chromebook, I am happy with the screen (it appears almost as nice as my MacBook Pro or MS Surface) in terms of color quality, radiance and overall clarity.  It's not a large screen and the bezel is a bit thick around the screen.  Asus did a good job of trying to keep it small without making the keyboard too crammed, and they didn't explode the screen to the edges likely for cost reasons.  All in all, this makes sense - had this been a $700 purchase or more I would have just gone with Google's own offering.The build quality is nice.  It's up there with an Apple Macbook.  My only complaint is that it's not super-thin (MacBook Air's seem to still have this niche figured out) which is useful when you have a space-saving travel need.  But for the most part, you could write your next novel on this thing, carry on with code development (if that was done in a cloud based shell) or anything else you really need to and if you stick to the rules and try to keep most of your life in the cloud, you don't have to worry if you lose the device that you've lost your entire livelihood.Bottom line?  If you already have a notebook, laptop, desktop, and a myriad of other ways to get your work done, this is a great buy that'll introduce the ""fun"" back (just because it's so fast) into the mundane.  10 hours (and those are real hours, not a made-up number from marketing) of battery is a great thing.  I'm not sure that this is a device for a student (I see a lot of people putting this into the hands of college kids) unless they are a CS major or just need a way to talk to Mom & Dad via email.  While it's nice to have the Google appstore, a linux shell, etc., it's not going to be as flexible as a laptop in the end (like a MS Surface or a Macbook).  To me, this is like the fun convertible to drive to work when I already have a truck or van in the garage.

  UPDATE: This is a sad, sad day. Running ChromeOS 70 now, and it's great!  Very fast, responsive, lots of Android apps up and going. But ... I'm sad. I took my Chromebook to work, put it in a padded sleeve, put that in a backpack and off I went. The backpack was on a chair, accidentally got knocked off. I wasn't too worried because the Chromebook was in a sleeve ... and it's aluminum, too!  But ... yep, you guessed it. It was damaged. The keyboard frame is still plastic, and not a very durable plastic at that. I am now the not-so-proud owner of a wonder Chromebook with a sizeable crack in the lower left corner. Sizeable. Noticeable. Disappointing!  Why bother with aluminum if it's cheapo plastic that can't take a padded drop.  Aaaargh. Machine still runs great, a little scar isn't going to change my thoughts about it. Just disappointed, that's all.UPDATE: Have had this puppy now for several months ... my opinion has changed dramatically! This is a really nice laptop ... really nice! It's running Chrome 67 now, and purrs like a kitten. Fast, beautiful display, comfortable keyboard, and the Android apps work well (not great yet, but well). I'm basically using this as a Chromebook, not taking advantage of the flip and Android apps, and this alone makes me happy! I am a big ChromeOS fan ... it's grown up so nicely, so very useful!! Eventually, I would expect the Android side to catch up and work as well as they do on my LG smartphone and Asus 10 tablet (both are excellent!).----I am sad to write this review ... I had high expectations for the C302. Sorry for the ""downer"" start here, because as a Chromebook, the C302 is very good. Not excellent, but the best among the 7 Chromebooks I own. Yes, I am up to my 7th Chromebook. BTW, even the lowest priced Chromebook (about $150) is good ... just slower at doing what it does. the C302 is fast ... but buggy. I had hoped, with the addition of Android apps, that it would be both a Chromebook and an Android tablet. With future upgrades, perhaps that will still happen. But I write this review just after I have turned off the Android side of this laptop. It is NOT a replacement for a good tablet (such as the 10 inch ASUS ... outstanding tablet, BTW!! Really outstanding!). The C302 m5 (the best processor I could find so far, is a very good Chromebook. It is fast, but it is ... quirky. All of sudden, out of nowhere, it just ... blips. Perhaps I'm tapping the touchpad by mistake (don't think so) ... that would explain the random jaunts around the screen. So ... I've only had this honey for a few days now. I'm going to play around more with it and see ... is it operator error, or does it really have a mind of its own. I will update this review when I have more experience. On the plus side, it is fast ... very responsive! I am a big Chromebook fan ... I am biased, but I'm also fair. Pains me greatly not to report that this is an excellent machine.So, after more use, guess what I found! (Oh, go ahead and guess!) When the screen is flipped 360 to turn the C302 into a tablet, the keyboard is disabled as you'd expect so when you put it on your lap, your knees are not typing by mistake! Except ... not all of the keyboard buttons are disabled. The up/down/right/left keys and some of the top row function keys are still active. So when I put it on my lap, my knees actually were having somewhat random impacts on the screen!  Hmmm. Well, now that I found that out, I can be more careful. Still, a very nice compact Chromebook ... with quirks.

  The Chromebook seems to be everything it's supposed to be and I wanted. BUT it spontaneously goes into dark mode (I think that's what ASUS calls it). The background is black and the characters are white. All the pictures look like old fashioned black and white negatives. I went to some users forums and found it is happening to others and no one can figure out how it gets triggered or how to get rid of it. I spent an hour on a chat with an ASUS tech and got no solution. He finally just disconnected my call after he ran out of ideas. A major hassle.UPDATE: I found the problem. High contrast mode was toggled on somehow. It is in such an obscure corner of settings that I could have have been there myself accidentally. So there is something in the Asus background updates etc that is randomly flipping the toggle. This should be in the first 10 or even 5 things to try when someone calls support with similar issues. The ASUS support people worked with me on line and by phone for hours before we stumbled over the switch almost by accident. The support is polite but clueless.Otherwise the chromebook is pleasing me.I've been through total breakdowns with Apple Genius bars ($500 screen replacement the genius said I needed turned out to be a $5 antenna wire from a third party  repair guy. So, in fairness, Asus support is utterly inept, but -- at times -- so is tech support from all the bigger companies as well.

  I am an Education Major, I needed something fast, simple, reliable, and easy to maneuver. This was and is my first chromebook. No,it is  it is NOT for gaming and NO it doesn't have Touch Screen capabilities, but it is great for doing homework, schoolwork, and exactly what I need it for, writing papers.  There isn't many thrills to it, but it is  the exact same PC that they use in public schools.

  I bought this for my 11 yr old son for Christmas because they use them at school and he loved them. It's everything he thought it would be, and I especially like that it's light and easy for him to carry around. It also has a very good battery life.

  I have grown to loathe this laptop. It's interface is a pain in the ass. I may as well be on my ipad. In fact, my ipad has a much better interface. As for being non glare I read that this would mean I could take it outside to use it. Not so, I couldn't see the damn screen no matter what angle or setting I put the thing on. I ended up taking classes on my phone and tablet way more than this piece of junk! I feel swindled. The longer I've had the thing the more things I found wrong with it. Trying to see a full size webpage? Forget it. Wanting a bigger screen than a tablet? Sure, if you can get around constantly readjusting your screen. Honestly, my six year old doesn't even like it. JUNK and a lot of money out the window.

  My old ASUS Chromebook FLIP lasted beyond the support for the OS from Google so with regret I retired it and acquired this new Chromebook to replace it. It is a nice laptop with great display and keyboard. Not slow at all and meeting my needs but it isn't the same as my old smaller, metal case FLIP which had the advantage of both size and a great touchscreen. You can buy FLIPs today but the price is considerably more than the equivalent without the 360 degree rotating touchscreen. For me this larger size (14"") is not as convenient as the smaller version with a 10.8"" screen and I miss the utility of the touch screen and feel of the metal case. This is a nice laptop I can use for work or play. The smaller FLIP was a unique tablet that fit in a pocket, was bomb proof and could go anywhere and do anything. I miss that light but bomb proof feel. I don't miss the price tag ASUS demanded for it when I had to replace my old one.If you don't need/want the more compact footprint of the smaller FLIP or the tablet functionality of any of the FLIPs this particular Chromebook laptop is a great, far cheaper option.

  This is a nice little computer, however, it's not what I expected to be getting.  In the item description, it says it's a Windows 10 operating system, which is why I spent the extra money on this one, and was very disappointed when it arrived that it is NOT Windows 10...it's Chrome.  The colors on the screen aren't very bright, and the screen is dull, not shiny like I had expected.  It does the job we needed it to, so we'll keep it, but just be aware of the misleading description.

  So, I just bought this laptop because my other one broke. This laptop has speakers on the bottom of it and they are closer to the front side so if you have it in your lap or on anything soft it will more thank likely be muffled, but they do have a good sound for such a cheap laptop. The screen in anti glare which I have never had, so it seems a little dim, but its not bad at all it just takes some getting use to. It is not touch screen, it is not one of those fancy laptops, but it will get the job done and it is vcery nice, espescially for the price.

  I'm generally a fan of ASUS but that came to an abrupt halt with this.  Bought it for my Daughter's college.  She opened it on her 3rd day of school and the hinges broke through the screen.  ASUS said they would fix it so I sent it off.  It's been 3 months and I still get the reply ""we are so sorry for the delay you are experiencing.  We are doing everything we can"".  They have not done anything and can't give me any answers.

  The good: I like the back lit keyboard, the fast, quiet solid state memory, the long battery life, the big 15.6 screen.  Used as a simple school or business tool it is a perfectly good computer.The not great: The 4gb ram is a limiting factor on this unit.  You cannot ever install additional ram to handle modern software or games, as it has no slots for ram at all. The 4gb ram is simply soldered in to the unit.Be aware of this when making this purchase.On the plus side, You can easily greatly expand on the 128gb solid drive by plugging in an internal m.2 SSD card.  An empty m.2 slot is provided. The speed of this computer is only slow when used for multi tasking with intense business software. Regular use is fine, in fact its pretty snappy with good performance. I did have to disable the windows 10 S mode. Disabling 10S is a built in option, allowing a return to regular windows. 10s would not function with the business software and non microsoft add ons I require. I am now running regular windows 10 with no issues.

  I was somewhat dragged kicking and screaming into upgrading my browser which is Windows XP Pro on my desktop. I always check my bank account daily, but they informed me that their website would no longer accept my old browser. I decided on the Asus laptop with Windows 10 Home. I only found out later it is 64 bit. I was pleasantly surprised as to how easy it is to navigate Windows 10. That 64 bit makes this laptop very fast. I didn't want to get rid of Outlook Express for e-mails so I downloaded OE Classic Pro which is a mirrored version of Outlook Express. I just love it and this laptop just happened to be on sale at Amazon. Such a deal!

  This is the perfect little commuter laptop. It‚Äôs small but not too small- keyboard is easy to use and the touchpad becomes a number pad with the touch of the button-one of my fave features!

Make sure to switch from Windows S (preloaded) to regular in update settings if you don‚Äôt want Windows controlling what products you can and can‚Äôt use for security. Not going to be a machine that handles massive memory hogging applications or processing ability.

  Very pleased with the product overall. The first charge took over 24 hours to get to 100% battery, which was concerning, but I haven't had to recharge yet, so I think I may be okay. I also had to reboot the tablet in order for it to recognize my wifi connections. The only other concerning thing was that it didn't automatically activate my Windows, but once I rebooted, which fixed the wifi issue, that corrected itself, too. I know I'm saying quite a few negative things here, but I am giving this a 5 star rating, because over all, I'm very satisfied with the purchase. Just reboot the tablet when you get it and know you may have to charge it for 24 hours (for the first charge) before using it.

  I bought three of these for my employees to use and so far they have been great. I think they are built with a decent amount of sturdiness and don't feel cheap at all. You have the benefit of having a tablet and a computer in one product. Our employees will be using these during their travels, so I feel better knowing that we are not losing an enormous amount of money if one is lost, broken, or stolen.The keyboard is just the right size. The screen removes easily to use as a tablet. Couldn't ask for anymore for the price.

  Amazing laptop. I have been a mac user for the past 15 years but wanted to buy something really cheap for my daughter. but after using this I have given up on macs. this is amazing and unbelievable. Although I am using Linux mint on this so cant say much about how windows will do on it. I have upgraded it with an OKN AX200 wifi adapter and fixed an extra aux antenna as there was only 1 antenna in the original card. I have also put WD 1TB NVME SSD. Boot time on Linux mint is 12 seconds and apps run amazingly smooth. designing is beautiful. No complaints so far. The screen is a big let down but that's the best you can get for the price. Don't expect to run heavy software. It's a daily on-the-go web surfing or movie laptop. the battery is amazing I have been getting around 8-12 hours on a single charge.

Contacted ASUS several times...worse customer support ever..we will get back to you within 24-48hrs. Never heard back...each time I call same song and dance.

  This is my 2nd time buying this laptop! Last time from a different seller, but the screen cracked (my fault, I dropped it several times). After the screen crack on my old one, I tried a more expensive laptop with more features, but I sent it back. It just could not compete with this one - I love how my ASUS is lightweight, slim, perfect size, and doesn't get hot on the bottom. Battery life is good. Only thing I could wish for in a future version is a backlit keyboard, but I'll gladly trade that feature in for this laptop! It meets all of my needs. Looove the touchscreen! Also upon arrival, I thought it was too slow, but I called Amazon tech support and he asked me to restart it and viola -- it is working nice and fast! Great for on-the-go use -- doesn't bog you down.

The tablet function is also really nice it folds back and forth without issue and that is important as I sometimes have to share it with my toddler.

  Immediately upgraded it to Windows 10. There were a few slight glitches, such as cursor disappearing, that were fixed by reloading drivers. (even though Windows said they were installed correctly).  There is no bloatware on this, save some Windows apps that you may never want to use anyway.  After installing the usual anti-virus/anti-malware and firewall, I have not had any notable problem.  As some have noted, the screen is not the top-of-the-line (for Asus), but its definitely better than average, and clear with nice colors.  I have found that I don't really use it as a tablet much, and prefer it as a small notebook -- but it functions fine as a tablet also.  I have no complaints and definitely find it extremely nice for its price point.

  The info in my first review did not pass the Amazon filters.  So, I'll try to say the same thing without setting off alarms.  I did a lot of research to find the best value tablet.  This one had a lot of good reviews, wish I could say the same.  At 4 months use, it shut off (while plugged in) and won't turn back on again.  That's $75 per month for the luxury of ""renting"" this laptop.  Problem is with battery, it is NOT designed to continue to hold a charge after 4 months (in MY case).  Next tablet I buy will be based on the quality of its battery to recharge properly over, say, 5yrs.  Meanwhile, I'm heading back to a tower version.  Hope Brand enjoys my $300.

  I like the computer.HOWEVER, I had to send it back due to power button issues just like everyone else.The replacement computer is working fine all except the TOUCH PAD.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.I upgraded to Windows 10 on the first computer but when I did I lost my webcam.I haven't upgraded with this replacement computer as of yet.8.1 is a pretty decent operating system for now and I don't want anymore problems right now.I suggest getting the 64GB Micro SD so you have some space to work with.I do wish it gave us ""Regular"" Office instead of the year subscription.But most computers don't give you Office at all, so it will be nice having it for a year.Finally, it's so nice having the FULL version of Windows instead of a ""Smartphone""OS.Good deal for the money but it seems like the price keeps going up.If you have just a bit more to spend, I would suggest getting the ASUS Transformer Book with the front and rear facing camera,USB 3.0, and the Full HD screen.I have read the reviews on it and it seems there are less hassles.May be worth it to spend that little bit extra!

  I love this device when I travel. Rather than hauling a 15.6-inch laptop at 5-ish pounds plus a power brick, this T100 is far more sensible. I had faith the Atom processor would ably run Windows 10 based on previous experience with an Intel NUC, and I found that Windows 10 runs all my apps on the T100 with reasonable speed and responsiveness. Whatever penalty in speed there might be, it doesn't register with me, even as I run PowerPoint, Word, and Excel 2010, as well as Citrix Receiver for my remote desktop and VLC for movies. Video calls on Skype work well. I bought the T100 for about $USD160 on sale at the Amazon Warehouse.When I bought the T100, I wanted a lightweight laptop to serve as a ""beater"" for travelling. My requirements were: cheap, lightweight (about 2 pounds), Windows 10 (I love Android, but I rely on Office and other Windows apps, so a Chromebook seemed like an unnecessary limitation), 64 GB on-board storage (a clean Windows 10 + Office 2010 can be as much as 20-23 GB), minimum 10.1-inch screen, micro-USB charging (no more power brick!), wireless, and a keyboard. The T100 filled these specs, but it should be understood that the T100 is really a tablet with a proprietary detachable keyboard (rather than a fold-over, like a Lenovo Yoga). Wireless has been solid, battery life has been excellent (easily replenished with USB power banks and chargers), and the Windows 10 touchscreen interface is pretty decent (even for taking notes). Bluetooth is also available for when you want to rock a mouse. I had heard good things about the keyboard, and I found it to be very good, although I usually don't preoccupy myself with the keyboard experience. The accessibility tools in Windows 10 are handy when I need to magnify the screen for close work. Should you run out of room on the installed drive, the T100 has an SD card slot for extra room.Ah, but it wasn't always so rosy. Windows 8 was loaded when the T100 arrived, and I fortunately followed advice to download Windows 10 fully before installing rather than doing an online upgrade. Much more of a sure bet that way. Even so, after upgrading to Windows 10, I found a fault in the power switch, so I RMA'd the unit back to Asus for repair/replacement. The unit returned, but with Windows 8, so I upgraded again, then I found another power fault. So I RMA'd >>again<<, this time with Asus paying the freight. Happily, the repaired T100 ran perfectly and has been completely reliable. My hat's off to Asus support for the double-RMA.One more point: the T100 runs 32-bit Windows 10. I have considered upgrading to 64-bit, which should be possible, but on an Atom processor the prospects for improved performance seemed dim, plus I was concerned that there would be no 64-bit driver support. 32-bit has been working fine.

  For the money you can't beat this little machine. A small, light full Windows OS allows me to run all the professional business apps I need.  Really like being able to use it as a touchscreen tablet and notebook.  The docking keyboard is a tad small, but I do find myself using it more as a notebook than a tablet.  I tag team touchscreen and keyboard a lot too.  The trackpad is responsive and works great.A couple things a buyer needs to be conscious of:1. There is no wired Ethernet port.  So I bought a plug-in USB to Ethernet adapter and works fine.  It is a bit dangly though.  Wifi is great.2. The back of the tablet has two speaker grilles, but sound only comes out of the left speaker. This is not a defect.  In recent versions, Asus did this on purpose probably to save money.  Volume is decently loud, but not in stereo.  Wired headphone jack sounds good.3. Charging is slow and you need to be wary that not all, non-OEM USB chargers are compatible if you have any laying around. From what I've noticed, chargers that advertise 2A per port will work.  It is hit or miss with chargers that advertise 1A, because not all actually put out 1A.  I have an external 1A USB battery pack that puts out about 600-700ma and it doesn't work with this so be advised.  Looks like it needs at least 750ma4. No DVD drive so I bought an external USB for $20 and use that when I have to install software from disk.This machine isn't for everyone, but works perfect for me.

  Excellent value for money, no issues whatsoever, quality screen and excellent keyboard, only negative according to me is that it is extremely hard to open the Chromebook from a closed position, they need to tone down the magnet clasp mechanism, you cannot open it with one hand and that seems a bit of an oversight. Earlier productions supposedly had a flimsy keyboard but mine seems to be extremely sturdy.

  The screen is muddy and doesn't have very good contrast compared to other Chromebooks I have used at the same price. The keyboard and build quality is much better than similar machines, and the battery life is great. There is no touch screen, and I don't use it for gaming but I imagine it wouldn't be great compared to a Windows machine with a dedicated GPU. Overall, I am satisfied but I use it for light surfing while watching TV.

  So far, this laptop has been a great purchase for the money. I don't often write reviews but upon reading some of the negative ones on this particular product, I was inspired to leave one. First off, a lot of people are complaining about the limited app store that you are forced to utilize while in Windows S mode. However it's super easy to change to regular Windows. The first thing I do immediately when using a new computer is download Chrome. With this computer, I just had to go through the motions of downloading Chrome, it told me I couldn't while in S mode and asked if I wanted to switch, I clicked ""yes"" and boom, regular Windows, no problem.It is correct that there are no regular old USB ports on this. However, I bought a $6 adapter and it's no big deal. I don't plug too many USB things into it anyway (it has bluetooth, so you can easily get a bluetooth mouse and bluetooth headphones), but the adapter is so cheap that I picked it up anyway just in case I ever should need it for a flash drive or whatnot.Some people talk about a pen. I'm not sure why. Mine did not come with a pen. But that wasn't a big deal either. I was able to get a Microsoft certified pen for $30 on Amazon that works perfectly with it (not a stylus, a true connective pen). The lack of a slot for a pen is a little inconvenient, but I purchased a pen clip that attaches to the side of the laptop (also very cheap) and problem solved.The processor could be better, it's a little laggy with too many Chrome tabs open, but for the price I can't complain. Overall, it needed a few tweaks (like the adapter, pen, and pen attachment) but it was worth it for the low price, lightweight machine, and great battery life. I've been a lifelong user of Asus products and while I have been disappointed in the more recent low reviews of their computers, I wasn't able to stray away to a different company, and once again I am not disappointed.

  I purchased a computer and found that it has apparently had the Windows 10  ""key"" already used.  I received the error ""We can't activate Windows on this device because the product key was already used on another device...""  UNBELIEVABLE that you would sell a computer in this condition!  I tried to get it replaced but was told that you cannot replace it because it was a ""renewed"" computer.  Wow.  Renewed??  Really?So I get the runaround. Called Amazon support, they can't help... they sent me to Asus, they can't help, they say someone from higher tier will call back, they don't.  I call them back.  They say they will send me the original Key in 24-48 ""business hours"" (this is now Thursday, so... by Monday).  Looks like on the Activation page there is NOWAY for me to enter the original key, but... oh well, I'll wait.Amazon could simply send me another computer... But I guess that would break them.STEER CLEAR!!!

  I purchased this and set it up for my friend's granddaughter. I'm also a PC building enthusiast that does IT work for a living. Right out of the box this thing impressed me. Very responsive and the right balance of hardware to perform really well for more than just average use. I'm really happy to see that it also includes USB Type C for connectivity. Just a heads-up before buying this though. It does not have old style USB Type A connections on it. You will need an adapter, hub, or just buy new peripherals with a USB Type C connector. For me it's not a big deal, because I already have upgraded most of my personal gear. For those unsuspecting buyers it may be a small annoyance when you first start to use it. Especially if you have a USB mouse that you plan on using. With the Bluetooth connectivity I simply paired my mouse and it works great. The same can obviously be done with other Bluetooth devices. This is just where the tech industry is headed with it's technology. You might as well suck it up now. I can't say anything negative about this laptop and I'm considering buying one for myself after spending a few days with it before giving it to my friend. The battery life was impressive and it's really pretty fast for what it is. It would be perfect for me to take on job sites and ditch the 15.6"" laptop I have now.

  I purchased this with the intent of installing some minor apps, google chrome, and using Microsoft office.  What I got was a nightmare.Windows S mode forbids you to install windows chrome.  Next logical step? Upgrade to regular windows 10.  Well the windows store wasn't capable of doing that due to updates missing.  I went to the store to perform the update.  However it would not update.  I restarted the computer and it reset my pin.  After 15 minutes of waiting for my pin to reset I finally got back in and now can't press the windows key or do anything.  I will now return this defective product and get a real computer.Get a chromebook or a regular PC. Avoid Windows S mode at all cost.  If a computer takes more than 30 minutes to even setup a web browser then that tells you something to avoid it.Microsoft and their obsession with forcing their products down people's throat has finally gone too far.

  Exceeded my expectations, once I figured out how to turn Windows 10 Home S into Windows 10 Home without buyingthe Windows 10 Pro upgrade. I love the light weight, decent performance, very long battery life. I find that I'm using it more and more in place of my heavy duty laptop. It runs all of my Microsoft Office 2016 Pro apps perfectly too. Finally a true laptop that you can use in your lap comfortably. The display is good, but not great. No touch screen issues and overall quality is very good. Best of all, you can't beat the price.

  To start, I believe this may be the first review I have ever left. My experience has been so negative that I feel compelled to share.In the beginning, the laptop seemed and worked great. We have a newborn in the house, though, so I was barely able to use it. When I did, I was impressed with its light weight, its overall design, and the processing speed. All were a great improvement over my older HP laptop.However, one day about 3 weeks after buying the laptop, the screen behaved oddly. It pixelated and froze. Once restarted, it operated properly, but obviously this was still an alarming development in a weeks old computer. I should have immediately sent in a return request to Amazon, but because of my odd Covid-related work schedule and our newborn, I just didn't react quickly enough. My BIG mistake.The next time I had a chance to use the laptop again, the screen conked out. To my dismay (and anger at myself), this was 2 days after the return window had closed. Now I was stuck. I tried restarting it, but each time the screen would start off fine, but then get 'flashy' (I'm not technically astute enough to describe its behavior any better), then it would go completely pixelated. Finally, it went irrecoverably black.Here's where it gets ugly. The ASUS online support is totally unavailable and misleading, referencing the coronavirus as a cause. There is no way to create an online RMA, as the website claims. Nor is their online tech and troubleshooting assistance available through chat, which again, the website claims. The clicks just circle you back around to homepage. The only way to get assistance is through a phone call. I called twice, and was on hold for 12 minutes before quitting, then 20 minutes before quitting.A curiosity- the voice over that is playing while you are on hold brags about how many awards they won in 2014. 2014 was 6 years ago! That is not a good sign. But I digress,I started to wonder if maybe they simply NEVER answered. ""Let's just ship out some bad PCs with no recourse for the customers""-- sure, not a long-term solution, but they could do well for the quarter.I committed to waiting them out, and on the third try I was able to get hold of a customer service rep after 50 minutes on hold. He was fairly helpful, though I did not like how forcefully he tried to get me to troubleshoot the problem myself. The problem was so obviously a manufacturer's flaw and not something user related that I feel like a standup company should have just apologized and offered to next-day a replacement to someone in my situation. That was far from the case. I was given and RMA and label to ship it back. That was ~October 23rd. They estimate the computer will be fixed within 10 days of receiving it, 10 days! Thankfully, I am not in a desperate situation. I have access to my old computer and my work computer. Imagine someone who needed a computer for their livelihood or school. 10 days is an eternity! Especially when you add in the transit times. That's 2 plus weeks.Except it's even worse. I tracked the shipment, and it arrived at the repair site on the 28th of October. However, when you use the ASUS RMA status checker, they don't acknowledge receiving it until November 3rd. So if they're measuring their turnaround time on repairs, but doing so with manipulated  receipt date, the already terrible 10 days is meaningless. Anyway, they set an estimated completion date. That date came, and the FIELD disappeared from the ASUS RMA status checker. The field was gone, not just the date. Now, it has reappeared, of course with the date pushed out.For an expensive purchase, this seems like it should be illegal. They have lemon laws for car; I wish there were similar for computers.Again, I am in no hardship. I have access to computers if needed. I feel for anyone who buys an ASUS and needs it, and has something go wrong. What happens if I get it back and the same issue recurs, or another pops up? Another hour plus with customer service, and another month turnaround to get it fixed?Maybe it is a great computer, and I just got the one in the bunch that was botched. I can't say. I have had one ASUS computer, and that one ASUS computer was trash. So they are batting .000 for me.Maybe Amazon can pressure companies that sell big ticket items to have some basic standards of customer service? ASUS has none. Their customer service is appalling. My wife bought an HP a week before I bought my ASUS. She was jealous of the ASUS, preferring its appearance and ergonomics. That jealousy disappeared pretty quickly, though. She had a minor problem with her laptop, and a rep talked her through it in minutes.And here I am, typing this review on my old computer.

  I regret buying this product.  Microsoft traps you into its so-called S-Mode, and there seems to be no way to get out.  Supposedly a benefit because, like Apple, it does not allow you to download any but its own or its approved programs for ""security"" reasons, this S-Mode won't let you download Chrome or other software.  I generally dislike Microsoft Edge as a browser, although others may love it; and I have invested in a myriad of excellent, non-Microsoft programs that I now cannot use!Supposedly, you can opt out of S-Mode, but whenever I attempt this, an error comes on, telling me continually to ""Try Later.""  I have tried everything to get out of S-Mode, and I feel misled.If you prefer a closed system, then fine; if not, check carefully before you purchase a pc that pre-installs Microsoft S-Mode.

  My last HP laptop quit working and was not impressive, so I decided to go back to ASUS, and boy am I glad I did.  This PC has 8GB of RAM and a 512GB HD.  The Core i5 processor is very fast.  Touchpad is very comfortable to use and the keyboard is great.  It reminds me a lot of my former Macbook in terms of design.  The backlit keyboard is a huge plus and the 10-key is small so it doesn't get in the way.  The small bezels help reduce the size while still getting an acceptable screen size.  Not the lightest, but it isn't heavy.The screen quality isn't amazing amazing, but is definitely good.  Battery life is a 7/10 and the size of the charger adapter is a bit clunky.This PC will primarily be used for work from home purposes (I work in IT) and it is awesome in doing that job.  I have always been a huge fan of ASUS and recommend them regularly.  This is a great PC for that use as well as document processing, web browsing, YouTube/Netflix watching, etc.  Highly recommended!

  I think this is a very nice laptop for the money.  Many other people that leave reviews somehow think this should have the features of a $1000 laptop.  If it did - it would cost more!Nice screen - higher res compared to others in this price range which is nice.  Very quick computer - loads up in a snap and the finger print reader actually works well.  Comes in Win 10 S mode which can be easily changed to Home version.The only minor complaint I have is that the keypad is kind of squashed onto the side of the keyboard.  Other than that - ZERO complaints!!Very nice machine for the price - I am a happy customer :)BTW -  Another nice thing is there are actually screws on the back in which you can easily open up the pc to install more ram yourself with no real headaches.

  Though I do not see how this is touch screen and I definitely don't think this would be the best for gaming at all.I purchased this for work.

  Needed a new laptop for home use. Streaming, surfing, and word docs. I needed something with 8 GB of RAM. My old laptop was having trouble using WebEx and Zoom. This one is fast, has a good size hard drive, and has performed flawlessly so far in the couple weeks I've had it. The backlit keyboard is a nice touch.

  If I could put less than one star I would. This is by far the worst computer I have ever owned. From the moment I turned it on, the thing continuously freezes, pages and documents are constantly crashing, and I have NEVER had a computer be this slow before. Especially not one that I JUST GOT. Save your money and get something better. Such a piece of garbage.

  So far we love it.....I am not sure of the battery life but hope it lasts for years to come because the battery is not replacable!  It is light weight and the charger is much smaller than a usual laptop charger....the only thing we dislike is it comes with Windows 8 which we hate but overall this is a great laptop!

  This is what you get for trying to get a laptop on a budget...After one month it just decided to not turn on. It seems the mother board just went out... really?The specs are everything were fine. But because it died after the period in which we can refund it, we wasted 326 dollars...I see the price is now at 256, but that isn't even a fair price still.This was for my dad cause his HP died after 4 years (cause he dropped water on it), and I recommended him an ASUS cause I have an ASUS and it has served me well for 3 years. But I guess really cheap ASUS's are bad...I got him the Dell Inspiron 15.6-Inch Laptop (i15RV-954BLK) on here, its around 350 for that and it has worked fine so far and he had it for 5 months now.

  First, I'm loving the speed of a new laptop running Windows 8 (downloaded separately). However, I find the mouse pad built into the keyboard a bit wonky. The cursor floats a lot and because all three surfaces (mouse, left-click, and right-click) are under one physical surface the cursor tends to float away as the user clicks. I'm getting used to the slight differences in keyboard layout (as well as the major differences in Windows 8), but it remains difficult to easily control the cursor. I'm considering resorting to a separate mouse! I did have one unexpected power-off event and found that none of the backup saves stuck so that several hours of work was lost. I was able to recreate it, but it was frustrating. Still, I don't know the reason for the momentary power loss. The screen is nice and wide. I'm not sure if it's me or the keys, but they don't always respond as I expect, but this doesn't happen often. I may just need more time to get used to the touch. The price was nice, but if I had a second chance I'd hold out for something a little more solidly built.

  So... I have a boat on the coast, about three hours from where I live.  I typically am very good about making sure I have my classic Windows Based lap top with me at all times, because of my work.  I just never know when I'm going to need to make a change to our website or utilize a Manufacturer's website portal.  Well.. Last weekend, I forgot my laptop and I desperately needed one... FAST.  I went to Staples and saw a Chromebook and was very skeptical.  In the store, I was able to access the website that I needed to work from.... Unfortunately, the Sales Person at Staples was 1) too lazy to see if the particular model that I was using in the store was available and 2) Actually told me that I would not be happy with this purchase and would likely return it and suggested that I shouldn't buy it... So.. I didn't.Instead, I borrowed a typical Laptop form someone and completed my work.I was still intrigued by the chrombook idea... So, I got on Amazon and found this little guy.. I figured that the water resistance on the keyboard might be helpful one day with the machine being primarily for the boat.  I also liked the rugged rubber on the outside.. I was concerned at first about the notion that this was a Student Machine... But... In reality, students are probably WAY ahead of me in computers at this point.I ordered this machine and in two days it arrived.  I LOVE it!  I am on the boat now typing and listening to Spotify on the machine at the same time.  It runs all of the programs and emails that I need for work and it is super light and easy to carry around.  It takes some time to get acquainted with some of the Chromebook processes and use features... Some are similar to standard PC but many are not.  I was very frustrated when some applications or websites wouldn't scroll down.. Then somebody showed me how two fingers on the touch pad at the same time allows for scrolling of any page.I have been able to access all spreadsheets that are emailed to me and open every business email or program.  I am going to keep using this as my primary machine until I find an application that I cannot do.  My biggest issue now is that this was designed to be left on the boat for emergency use, but I find it so easy to use and practical that I will likely be taking it home...Also, it operates very fast and I have had none of the issues with the touch pad or with slow operation that some people have mentioned in the reviews.  When you open it, it is ready to go.  No waiting for it to boot up or anything like that.I highly recommend this.

  My son has a Samsung Chromebook that he is using for e-learning that we've had for a couple of years. I was working from home on my laptop that was not fast enough for my work projects with Google Slides. I used my son's Chromebook to see if it would keep up with my Google Drive work load and it did. My other son has a full size Asus laptop that is nice one.  I didn't want a full size laptop. I looked around online for a Chromebook for myself and came upon this little gem. I LOVE IT! Of course Chromebooks are fast and easy to set up. That is probably standard across the board no matter what brand you choose. What I like about this Asus Chromebook over some of the other Chromebooks I've worked on is the keyboard. It's keys are raised and not as flat. I prefer that for better typing as my own personal preference. I like the look and feel of this Chromebook. It's light weight and not bulky. The screen quality is nice. Someone in another review of this Chromebook commented that the blue lettering was hard to see on black keys. I have not had any issue with it. The blue is a baby blue which stands out fine on the keys, so not a dark blue on black. And my eyes aren't perfect, so I don't feel this is an issue at all. The touch mouse-pad is great. I have been working with Google Slides and Good Docs with ease. It keeps up beautifully. (happy dance)I've had no issues with this Chromebook. It fits my needs for my work and personal needs. I could not be happier.

  I'm in a Doctoral program, picked this up considering it's price, never had a chromebook before, never again.I downloaded from the Google app store, the MS Office apps, Word, XL, PPT and a few other things I tend to use.In a virtual class, we use Zoom.  I had chrome open, 3 tabs I think, and the Word and PPT app, and the zoom app with about 7 connections, only 1 using video.  Sound was static-y, slurring, breaking up, in and out.  Video was not so great, pausing, skipping, basically Verzion's issues at home.  I repeatedly got a pop up message, something to the effect of, ""Performance issues due to low resources"" (overtaxing the processor).  THAT'S NOT GOOD!!I'm probabaly returning the device.  If it cannot handle 3 tabs open in chrome, 2 apps, and zoom, it's a dud.  Very confused how this got such great reviews.  People must be using it for writing 1 or 2 sentences of unformatted text in notepad - otherwise, it's pretty useless.

  I bought this item twice. The first time, three days into it the charger would no longer plug into the computer and so I had to return it and get a replacement.I LOVED the replacement. Used it for everything. Fell in love with it. Unfortunately, less than two months after buying it, I was on the wifi working on it one minute and it just stopped working the next. Wireless light was on. It would connect to the network with a good signal but couldn't load any pages. I would just get ""waiting for cache"" and ""resolving host""  and then ""no internet"".  Meanwhile the Samsung 3 next to it, the Samsung Smart TV, Amazon fires and my trusty old Dell Inspiron worked just fine. Did all the trouble shooting nothing helped. Finally had to do a powerwash which is factory reset and now it says it's not connected even though showing that it is connected. So now it's a paperweight until I can find someone smarter than me to figure out how it could go so wrong so quickly.I really liked it otherwise but a chromebook that hates my quarantine induced wifi which is working fine otherwise is a person without a soul. So I just ordered another copy of the Samsung 3 chromebook that I'm typing this review on. It's actually less expensive than it was.I would recommend the Asus but this ""resolving host"" even at factory reset doesn't work. Maybe other shoppers have better luck.

  Its a great laptop at 215.00$ the best thing about the laptop is the battery life I usually get 7- 11 hours and the stand by power is good for almost 24 hours while never going to sleep. The worst thing about this laptop is the trackpad its terrible and the SD Card reader wont allow the SD card to be fully inserted it will only go 1/2 way in so if you were planning on using a SD card for extra storage the SD card will always be sticking out a good 1 inch and will probably get damaged if you arent careful while moving it around. I immediately switched to windows LTSB before even turning it on so I cant offer info on stock OEM win 10S it comes with but I assume its awful, I would highly recommend switching to WIN LTSB or WIN Server 2016 as soon as you buy this laptop. I have the 64GB version and I also use a external HD with it and I have gone through 5 major windows cummulative updates and have had zero issues with storage, I keep no media stored on this PC & only have office installed and have 40 GB available of the claimed 64 it ships with. I have owned this laptop for 4 months and had zero problems so far I would buy this laptop again at the 215$ it sold for.

  Small, light, simple and well priced laptop. I have a range of computers around the house and just wanted a cheap, light, simple PC to run some windows applications for car maintenance and garage tools. This is perfect, it's cheap, fast enough, the Wi-Fi is good and so far it seems to be a predictable and convenient machine.It's no space rocket, but it does the job efficiently and a very good price point.

  I have only had this a few days. I'm very happy with it. Keyboard is nice, it runs very fast after making a few changes. I cleanup all the old window files and got close to 30g of space. Added a extra mem and I have windows downloading all new files and programs there. For the price of this computer I'm very impressed. I have had more expensive ones that does not preform as well as this one. having wireless AC does make this a wonder.update: i have added office 2016 and runs it great. Hooking up to the internet I'm impress with the speed. This unit runs smooth as a top.I would buy this computer again with no problem. this company makes great computers.

  Has nightmare wifi disconnection problems on battery. Almost missed my midterm assignment because this kept dropping wifi connection about 7 times in 5 minutes. was in a good wifi area too. And the bottom of the laptop gets very very hot almost burn your leg. Browsing chrome on 2 tabs for about 20 minutes got this thing cooking really good, the heat can be felt on the keyboard too. The good thing about this is that there is no better looking metal computer at this price range, if you want looks and style but dont plan on using this much then get it. Keyboard is nice. the ac adapter is really small and light. touchpad is very very nice feeling. screen is 1920 by 1080 resolution which is amazing. get premium feel for a budget price. the battery does last almost 10 hours.

  I was looking for a very inexpensive laptop for the use of writing, browsing internet, etc. and this pretty much fits the bill. It's a budget laptop and at $400 list you are obviously sacrificing on some quality, but this is still a great device. Form factor is really nice and study and it does the job it needs to. If you want to game or stream a bunch of videos, you'll need to splurge on something with a better processor and graphics card. But if you're like me and just looking for something to write and email with, this is a great choice. Bonus: I found an open box deal that got this below $300 with Prime shipping. Fantastic deal.

  It is no more than  two months since I've bought it and  Once in a two or three days  my laptop used to be turned of itself  and i wasn't able turn it on (not even with the charger). sometimes (more rarely) i had same experience with my old laptop with removable battery , so in this situation removing battery and put it back helped.. But as for ASUS Vivobook E403NA-US04 , it doesn't have removable battery, so only thing to turn it on was take it to professional. with the help of his interference I was able to turn it on but the problem still remained- it used to be turned off again and again. now I can't turn on laptop without charger (when i remove charger it automatically turns off) now i have to buy new battery but still don't know what is the core of problem

  This computer appear has some serious memory issues. A simple tab of Firefox can freeze the computer, which then renders the mousepad unusable until a restart, for whatever reason. An extra mouse is a must because the second it even starts to slow down, the mousepad stops functioning. I can deal with a slow computer, after all, it's pretty cheap. But the mousepad just stopping altogether, even after the system has caught up, all because of opening a browser tab? Unacceptable. Stay away from this product.

  Really like this purchase. Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.

  Ok. Lets talk. No fluff, no fake optimism. Out of all the things I have ever bought on amazon, this purchase was honestly the best. First of all, this laptop exceeded all expectations I had. Like for example, when I saw the laptop for the first time, the screen was sooo much bigger than I anticipated! I love the feeling of the keys. Also, I'm sure you've notice there are a lot of reviews complaining about the screen quality. Ok. Here's the tea sis; the screen is awesome. I'm not seeing anything wrong with it. Those people must be computer experts but for me, there is nothing wrong with it. Also, a big criteria for me was that I could do some gaming. Dude. Literally this laptop is awesome for gaming. It has taken everything that I've downloaded so far and is still purring like a kitten. Overall, this is a super good laptop. I totally think you should get it.

  Let's start with the hardware itself. I was worried the screen would be as terrible as some of these reviews indicate. In my opinion, the screen is just fine. It's probably not great in very bright sunlight, or for video or photo editing purposes. Otherwise, if you just want to do indoor office work, or browse the web, it's totally sufficient and not a reason to pass up this laptop. If you are already used to higher quality displays or have demanding display needs, stop being cheap and look to spend a bit more money.I like the feel and look of the keyboard but I don't like the layout so much. It's novel to include the keypad on a laptop of this size, but it's too close to the other keys. The result is that sometimes you hit the number pad instead of enter, or backspace. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker, and if you type a lot like I do, you'll probably find that you can develop a type of muscle/spacial-familiarity to where it becomes an infrequent issue very quickly.I bought this laptop to install linux on. It required a bit of wrangling with the BIOS to make that possible. Firstly, secure boot and some other settings need to be disabled in the BIOS. Next problem was, this machine does not seem to be capable of booting from the microSD card slot at all. I was able to boot off a USB-connected drive. Once I set the built-in storage interface mode to AHCI in the BIOS, I was able to complete my installation and everything works great. For the record I installed the ""elementaryOS"" distro.

  CPU: Great works quicklyRam: 8gb works quicklyBest budget laptop hands down....The screen though is pure garbage. viewing angles are horrible and the panel is just gray.... idk how to explain it but yeah.... it sucks but for $400 you aren't going to find a better laptop so 5 stars for the price.

  This review is coming from a person who builds computers. I bout this for a extended 3 month stay in the African Bush with no conection to the outside world except electricity. Overall this is a great value for what your getting minus the slow hard drive. $480 at time a purchase in mid 2018. A 7th gen i5 7200u processor, excellent screen. It‚Äôs screen is beautiful, and reproduces 130% of the color spectrum compared to 70% by Dell‚Äôs inspiron 13 5000 2in1 and Acer & Lenovo‚Äôs 2in1‚Äôs of the same price point. Best screen in its class by far. Good snapy mid range processor. Good range of ports. Nice Aluminum top makes it feel premuim. The build quality and design makes this laptop look and feel much more expensive than it is. It even has a backlit keyboard! My only complaint is the Keyboard though. Although it is backlit, typing on it is a very subpar experience. Its not bad but its not good either. If your going to be using this for work doing lots of documents go for the Dell 13 5000. Its keyboard is much better. And my recomendation to anyone considering any computer with Windows 10. DO NOT get a pc with a 5400rpm hard drive. Or at least use an ssd as your boot drive. And the HDD as storage. Windows 10 is very demanding and slow on traditional hard drives. I purchsed an M.2 SSD for a boot drive.

  HUGE upgrade for me, and it really is the perfect laptop--backlit keys, 2 in 1, stylus included. It's the whole package. The fingerprint sensor is super convenient and the ASUS pen is absolutely perfect--no calibration required. The screen is incredibly crisp and clear. My ONLY complaint is that the outer shell is a bit prone to fingerprint smudging, but it wipes away fairly easily. A TINY inconvenience.This feels like an $800-1000 laptop, and you're getting it for hundreds less. The bad reviews are from previous sellers that are no longer included in this deal--everything came PERFECTLY in my package and you can expect the same. ASUS has never let me down!

  I'm about a month in to ownership and, for the price, I'm happy with this laptop.  Keep in mind that at this price band you are looking at the lower- to mid-tier laptops of the world.  With that being said, you can definitely do a lot worse.  You're getting a touchscreen with a fully flexible screen hinge (big plusses for me), a decently fast processor (7th gen i5), 1080p screen (a must for me, again), and a decent build.One thing that should be noted is that I immediately replaced my HDD with a SSD; if you or someone you know has the tech know-how to do this I recommend it but they should proceed with caution; Asus does not make the disassembly easy with their short interior wires.  Now that I have it, the laptop is as quiet as can be and the fan rarely turns on.  Adding a $75 SSD to this laptop makes the total value closer more comparable to $600-$700 laptops.One other small knock (aside from the short wires) on it is at the keyboard is not backlit.  You get used it, but I do miss it.  Some reviewers dislike the keyboard as it is mildly bouncy.  I, for one, don't mind it one bit.  The buttons works and it doesn't appear to impact my typing speed in any way.So, you're getting a good value at the price.  In my book, the star rating is all about value and this laptop has so far deserved the 5 stars.

  So the other product reviews are true.  The Wi-Fi on this device doesn't work very well.  The computer is very slow with the current hard drive.  If you look at other configurations of this computer model you will see that it has an SSD hard drive and that they work very well.  So... If you have a spare Wi-Fi adapter usb and a spare SSD hard drive or you can get a cheap one on a sell and you don't mind picking apart the computer.... This computer is the one for you.... Otherwise I would not recommend for the average user.

  This thing is GARBAGE!  DO NOT BUY!  I tried telling Amazon they didnt seem to care much and then was in contact with ASUS. Yes I did take a minute to talk to them but all they wanted RIGHT AWAY was a service fee to look it over.  it is the slowest laptop ive ever seen and this was the 2nd and 3rd use of it  remember when aol would have to dial tone it for you yeah that was faster!  all asus careda bout was money to look it over  HOW ABOUT take pride in your product and back your product!  spent over 600 FOR WHAT A PAPER WEIGHT!  CAS THIS ISNT A LAPTOP.  I WILL NEVER BUY ASUS AGAIN AS THEY DONT BACK THEIR PRODUCT WELL ENOUGH  LOOK ELSEWHERE!  WHAT A JOKE  NEVER AGAIN

  For the price of around $500-$600, the performance is reasonable, but it is slow when trying to multi-task, or trying to install applications. I ran some code on this machine with small data sets, and it worked just fine, but it's definitely not up to the task of handling slightly larger data sets such as those from a database. I would say this laptop is mostly applicable for browsing the internet, but even with browsing web pages, there was times when the computer would pause for a moment. I'm willing to pay an extra $200-$300 for something that can process information faster, and I'm returning this product as we speak.

  This is an excellent laptop.  Fast, light weight and great screen resolution.  However the built in WiFi feature did not work and unit was returned.  I have a WiFi USB device and was able to get on line to check out responsiveness and was very impressed.  I would have not returned if the WiFi had been functional.

  I'm a longtime Chromebook user and am amazed how far these super affordable laptop replacements have come.I overcame the inherent limitations of my last Chromebook by dual booting to Linux, but between new features and the availability of apps, my new ASUS Chromebook Flip C214 2-In-1 Laptop is able to handle almost all of the tasks I need without having to go geek.My favorite features are the ability to flip and use the C214 as a drawing tablet. I used to have to drag my large laptop with me when I needed to work on graphics, but with the new Krita app and the C214's stylus & drawing capability I can get by with the Chromebook when I'm on the road.The battery charge varies by how many tabs I have open and what I'm doing. It usually goes 8 - 10 hours on a full charge. If I'm just reading or writing it can go more.I've had this model for about three months and haven't had many issues. The touch screen and track pad work well, though I have had a problem recently with the charger. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the cable/power pack or the usb port.UPDATE: My charging issue turned out to be the cable. It was an easy replacement and it now charges fine.It mirrors nicely with a large desktop monitor, but I'd also like to have the ability to connect to multiple monitors.  But that's just a someday/maybe thing.Overall I'm very pleased with how the C214 has been working for my everyday work needs and that I can usually leave my very bulky laptop at home.

  I use this chromebook mostly for online college classes, and it has worked great for my needs.  I am actually contemplating buying another one for my son, who has definitely put this thing through it's paces.  He has dropped it more than a few times and no cracks to the screen yet.  He mostly uses it in tent mode for the camera, but he is not gentle with it whatsoever, and I have had no issues with it at all.  Just recently we've had to use it for his online schooling needs as well.  It's a great size and very user friendly.I did have an issue with the first one I received that sounded similar to one of the reviews about random phantom touches on the screen, and different windows opening.  I had it folded in half a couple days after getting it and noticed that the screen was not completely flush to the frame on the bottom.  It turns out the random screens that were popping up were from my bookmarks bar and they were opening randomly and frequently depending on the angle of the screen.  I would not have noticed it had I not put the screen at a certain angle.  I asked for an exact exchange from Amazon, and got the new one and have had zero issues with it.Overall I totally recommend, and am definitely thinking of buying another.  The battery life is great, it's not heavy, it's very versatile, and above all, it can withstand a VERY rough 8 year old boy folding and sliding it all over the place!

  Do you want really fast?  Ultra sharp screen?  Don't buy this.You buy this one to survive a household with elementary school age kids and you want the touch screen and to flip/tent it like a tablet on a stand.  And it does a great job at running everything Chrome and Android.

  This is one of 4 chrome books in my house. We mostly like it, but there's a huge issue with the touchscreen that renders the touchscreen, the pen, and tablet mode unusable: It constantly (every 30-60 seconds) registers phantom touches.It's like a ghost is touching the screen in random locations.Typing in a document? Expect the cursor to move around the text at random.Working in a spreadsheet? Expect to find yourself typing in random cells.Watching a video? It will pause/unpause at random.Reading a web page? Links will be clicked at random.The touchscreen can be disabled with <search>+<shift>+t, so that's how we're able to live with it.

  I don't upgrade computers until I have to but when I do, I study extensively to find the best bang for my buck. I believe that my ASUS fits that bill as it provides everything I need for less than $400. I did make a mistake in paying $50 more to get the scripting pen as I have never used and can't imagine I ever will. Other than that I have had only two issues with this laptop. Firstly, the touchscreen is not responsive when I try to close a tab as I often try repeatedly to close a tab and eventually am forced to utilize the keypad or touch pad to close the tab. Secondly, and most recently, the screen has went totally blank for hours. However, just when I think I am going to have to shop for a new laptop, the screen will function. You can forget ASUS customer service as they are impossible to contact which is especially disappointing given that this one one of the primary reasons I purchased ASUS. My only other  comment is that I had long deliberated over whether I would be satisfied with a Chromebook when I had always been a big fan of Microsoft products and PC's. The conclusion is that I will always have a Chromebook going forward as it is so much more efficient for my basic needs.

  Liked the form factor and performance.  But the screen wanted to come out of the frame. Other reviewers have mentioned this.The more serious problem was that the SD card slot was intermittent.  The card would be electrically ""ejected"" during operation and I would get warnings not to do that or the card could be damaged and data lost.  Asus support made some suggestions and finally concluded that I should return it.

  After much research looking online for hours and hours trying to figure out what budget laptop is the best bang for your buck, I have chosen this one and it doesn't disappoint.Pros:It has very good looks, is thin, lightweight isnt loud and a solid build. Sure it's plastic but it looks nice and feels nice.The keyboard is big and back-litThe touch pad is big and has a fingerprint sensor to easily login windows.It's really quick at anything you throw at it in terms of simple tasks like browsing the web, watching youtube videos and multitasking,.This ISNT a gaming laptop HOWEVER you are able to run games that arent too taxing. fortnite can be ran at medium to low settings and be playable. I also am able to run borderlands 2 on medium and high settings with respectable frame rates.CONS:The screen while nice and large and has very slim bezels, isnt the best. The viewing angles arent that great to be completely honest. The colors dont pop and even may look washed out. It's not the worst screen but far from the best.Speakers arent that good they fire from the bottom. However it's not that bad you dont really expect laptops to have that great sound. It gets the job done to watch movies and youtube but dont go expecting very muchThe memory is low. Get another hdd and add on cause you will fill this up rather quickly. That's my next step .OVERALLFrom all the laptops i found in this price range, I say this one is the best. Acer laptops come close but dont offer the design this one does at this price range.

  I ordered this PC thinking it was a Quad core CPU as was described in headlines on product. Upon receiving the notebook I realized that this is not the case. Its a duel core CPU with hyperthreading which the title doesn't describe this properly.Because of this, I decided to return the notebook, I also had some other minor issues, such as Wifi being weak, the screen quality was not very good. Colors were washed out, and the Matte screen made this worse.

  It's an ok laptop that can do most basic tasks. With nice features such as backlit keyboard. Better than most other laptops based on price.Cons, it's a dual core, not quad core like how Amazon said.

  We have only had it for less than  2 months, and it had to be sent back for a problem already. It was working great, until the Aptio BIOS Utility screen popped up out of the blue and we couldn't get out of it. Hopefully they fix it or replace it so we don't have that happen again.

  SSD included is an Intel SSDSCKKW512H6 which is not an NVMe SSD, as was indicated by the title. It is an M.2 SATA SSD. According to its specs, it can do up to 560 MBps reads and 480 MBps writes. The slowest NVMe SSDs do about 1800 MBps read / write, so this is a significant difference. Other than that, this is a pretty good deal and product. I'd suggest the seller revise the description to say it's an M.2 SATA SSD instead of NVMe.

  This laptop honestly looked better before I opened it.Fan? Always on. Temps? Hot. Speakers? Peaking at 70% volume. SSD speed? Slow. Wi-Fi? Slow. Viewing angles? Don't bother.The fact that this laptop came installed with a Windows build from APRIL 2018 is unacceptable, but the rest of this product doesn't help its case. This is the only laptop that I've ever had that it took me 2 hours to hit the 'return to Amazon' button.The screen was perhaps the worst part, with it having literally no viewing angles. If I pushed it too far one way, the top would be unreadable, and if I pushed it too far the other way, the bottom would be unreadable. Even software solutions couldn't help this - quite honestly - AWFUL panel.Also, this thing runs Windows S out of the box. No one thought to put that in the description? It's an easy fix, sure, but at least be up front about what your system is.Speaking about what the system is, why is it so got-dang slow? My version had an SSD and 12 GBs of RAM - almost the same specs as my current laptop - and yet it was somehow slower than a PC from 3 years ago. Downloads were sluggish, and if it was working for too long? Oh boy, did the fans RUN. I thought this thing was about to levitate off of my bed! Why are the vent holes on the bottom?!Don't buy this. Save your money.

  I'm a software developer who stares at 4k screens all day. The strain on the eyes was rough. I bought this laptop BECAUSE it didn't have the ultra bright resolution and colors. It's still full HD and looks as good as something 4-5 years ago. I mainly use the laptop with Visual Studio and general CLI-type applications and so far I have been beyond impressed. The 20gb of ram and 1tb SSD was a no-brainer for the cost. The unit does ship in S-Mode, but can be switched out to the advertised Windows 10 Pro very quickly. Battery life seems to be approx. 7-8hrs in normal usage and that's good enough for me. I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a secondary development machine.

  I purchased this laptop (after sending another one back) because it was a bit more expensive and should have worked for lite everyday use. However, the issue (and reason for my 3 stars) is due to the screen colors being so washed out. I've adjusted all the settings I could, brightened the screen, tweaked everything I could think of to no avail. I've posted a screenshot in front of my other Asus (granted it's a higher end machine) for comparison. I've purchased 8 or 9 laptops in the past and none of them have ever had this issue. It's the same reason I sent the other one back. You get what you pay for I suppose. I won't be ordering a budget laptop again without seeing it in store first.

  I bought this laptop for my new job in May of 2020 and up first it worked great but as I have owned it I've had nothing but problems with it. It freezes up on me between 5 and 10 times per day sometimes the screen will go black right in the middle of a project that I'm working on. The only way to fix it is to power off completely. And everytime I call support nothing gets fixed and they want me to do a hard reset so I'll lose all my information. I don't know what's going on and I plan to take it into a computer repair person but I've had to purchase another computer in the meantime just so that I can do my job. I wouldn't recommend this computer at all.UPDATE:  I sent this computer into their RMA warranty department since it had basically just become an expensive paperweight and they replaced the motherboard.  They had it for about 4 1/2 weeks.  It wiped my whole computer and I had to reinstall everything once I got it back.  To date it is still freezing and not functioning adequately.  Please DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER, IT IS FAULTY.

  I love the product, but I'm waiting for the seller to resolve a few issues before writing a complete review. The computer looks brand new and has no issues so far.***UPDATE***There were a few minor issues with the laptop, nothing physical. After contacting the seller and a few emails discussing a possible solution, the seller resolved laptop issues to my complete satisfaction.I found that they were easy to work with, and they went out of their way to expedite the resolution.As I have said, the laptop looked brand new with no cosmetic issues. I highly recommend this third-party seller if you're looking to buy a great laptop without paying a new high price. Asus is one of my favorite brands.

  Have used this laptop now for several months. Good price but lacks a standard SD card slot, which I find very annoying. (It does have a micro-SD.) The other characteristic I no not like is that, even with touchpad sensitivity set at its lowest, this pad is too sensitive, resulting in unwanted actions. I had to eliminate double-tapping in favor of press-clicking to avoid problems. I would probably rate this a bit less than four stars if I could, but it is far better than three.

  The touch screen is pretty great! The laptop works very quickly out of the box. Now, the laptop doesn't have a usb port. You will need a usb c to usb port adapter for that as I needed one. Side note: you can dual boot the laptop like I did. For college work, the battery is good! Not every laptop can have a lasting battery, but this one might be! No issues as of now. Will update when issues arise. Other than that, I love the product!!

  This review is specifically for model TP401M.TLDR: don't buy this as your main laptop - can't upgrade the 4gb memory, and it might as well not have a webcam considering how horrible it is.I have a 7 year old gaming Asus laptop, while I realize that this Asus flip is miles below a gaming laptop I wasn't prepared for how much slower it would run than the one I bought 7 years ago. I wasn't expecting 4gb of memory to run especially fast, but I did expect to be able to upgrade it.So for anyone else with the same expectations, the 4gb memory in this laptop CANNOT be upgraded. It will be 4gb for life. You cannot add extra memory, and the 4gb is permanently attached. 4gb is actually very low by today's standards, considering my old laptop has 16gb. That's the main problem with this model, and it can't be fixed.Aside from the low memory, this laptop suffers from other drawbacks. There is really only 1 viewing angle, don't be fooled by the description. If you're not looking straight at it you won't see what's on the screen with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Also, the webcam is absolutely horrible - blurry, laggy, really looks like something you'd see on a smartphone from 20 years ago....so if you use video conferencing extensively for work or school you should absolutely not get this laptop due to webcam alone.All that being said, the reason I gave it 3 stars, rather than 2, is if you know what you're getting then you might appreciate the positive features. It's a very light and slim laptop, which if great if you plan to carry it around with you a lot. And for a low end laptop it has a surprisingly responsive touchscreen.So in summary, if you're looking at this to replace your current laptop....keep looking. There are better, similarly priced, flip options that can do basic things like browse he web and edit documents, which is really all you can use this for. If you want to do anything else with it (I personally wanted to play games using an android emulator), or if you use a webcam regularly, then definite skip this one. I can really only see someone liking this thing as an extra laptop that's easy to carry around, if other mobile devices are insufficient.

  Can anyone explain to me why a ""brand new"" computer would require a PIN for startup? Why a brand new computer wouldn't have plastic over the screen or camera? Why the box wasn't sealed? I bought this computer for my daughter, hoping to make the thought of remote learning at least a little less drab for her. We finally got a chance to set up her desk tonight. I told her if she cleaned her room, I'd show her how to use her new computer. She cleaned her room.. Guess who couldn't hold up their end of the deal? I called the number listed on the box and reached some emergency hotline. Thankfully, they were able to give me the correct number (clearly that happens a lot). I called the correct number, but of course it was outside of business hours. I am one very pissed off mama, so someone needs to make this right and quickly (school starts next week!) and I'll consider changing my rating. This was my first time purchasing an Asus and more than likely my last. Nowhere in the description does it state that it is a used/renewed/refurbished product.

  Bought this laptop to be a casual thin and light for my wife. Noticed while just installing chrome that there was a lot of issues just moving around the UI. Had not done anything else at this point; check task manager to see whats going on and see the CPU is running at 100% with nothing else running. That seemed strange, which is what drew my attention tot he processor:Celeron 3350, not the 4000 they advertise. While the small difference in their boost clocks isn't significant, the 4000 has double on the level 3 cache of the 3350. Maybe a 4000 would lag just as bad, but the fact the reseller tried to bait and switch selling a different model (Asus 406N vs Asus 406 they have listed) gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe they didn't do this to everyone since most people here seem happy with it, but they did it to me so beware.

  I cant say anything about the components, but I absolutely HATE this laptop--it came with Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge wont allow the download of any software that doesn't come from the Microsoft Store..I have been trying for 48 hours to disable or eject it, but its as pernicious a piece of software as there ever was. This makes this laptop USELESS. Dont even think about even changing your browser to say Google or whatever you prefer because this MICROSOFT EDGE-infected piece of junk sabotages you in 9 different ways. Junk Junk Junk, Avoid. Asus you need to get your act together on this too and dissassociate yourself from MICROSOFT products.

  I'm editing my review to be more detailed now that I'm not just exhausted and miserable over the whole thing.I got this laptop after a lot of debate. My old laptop - which was admittedly on its ...sixth/seventh year of hard wear and tear - was finally losing its monitor, and my computer repair guy told me it'd be about $100 to fix and I figured for just a few hundred more I could get a new laptop. I don't need top of the line in my laptop - I keep my PC for that. For my laptop I just need something I can work on editing on google docs or word, and surf the web.I saw this one, it was in my price range, and I trust ASUS in general. Something felt off as soon as I got this laptop - the start up just felt extremely fast - and it felt extremely fast just to INSTANTLY go EXTREMELY slow. Windows crept along. Clicking anything didn't register for literally 30 or more seconds. ""Okay,"" I figure, ""maybe it's just still installing windows stuff in the background. I'll leave it alone.""It took 3 days for it to ""finish instaslling"" everything, and that didn't stop it going slow. It kept going slow. I contacted Amazon support, they suggested I contact ASUS, so I agreed - but decided to wait, in case of the install thing.""Okay,"" said I  - still optimistic - my optimism would hold for a while longer. ""Maybe it's Microsoft S. I wanted to leave that anyway.""It took me over an hour - clicking, waiting for the click to register, selecting what I wanted to do - waiting 10-15 minutes for it to load - to get Microsoft S to turn off. Shock of shocks (please read sarcasm), that did nothing.I turned it off  (which took 45 minutes) and then turned it back on. That didn't work. It still crept along slow. I turned it off and turned it back on - and hey! It wasn't slow anymore! I breathed a sigh of relief! I shifted it off my lap desk and on to the bed and it instantly blue screened.Okay, maybe I...moved it too hard? I thought. So I restarted the thing yet again. This time it seemed to function fine, other than now and again the touch pad would just stop responding to any input and I had no idea if it was going slow again or just not working (both, back and forth, it turned out).  I settled it on my bed to go get a glass of water, and all was well. My cat moved past it and hopped off the bed, and the slight jostle of him walking past (and he isn't a chonk! he's like 13 pounds and he's supposed to be 12-15!) and it blue screened again.My friends finally convinced me that my optimism was misfounded, contact ASUS support.  I contacted them on 12/27 and having previously worked support for a company I know the days after Christmas are the worst - so when I was 4th in queue for 4 hours I wasn't shocked, and by that point I had to leave for work so I left the queue. A few days later I tried again (this was the chat-help queue, I should note), I was 3rd in line for 4 hours before I gave up. I then just was stressed by work for a week, so only finally called support yesterday (1/14) where after going through the phone tree I was (accidentally, I think anyway) hung up on.And I just gave up. Put the refund through and started the 14 hour process of reformatting the laptop to remove any sign I'd ever signed in.I fully guarantee there was something just wrong with the hardware. If I could have gotten through to ASUS, they probably would have fixed it - I imagine this was a fluke. But with my experience, I literally can't in good conscience give this laptop above a 1. So I'm off to find a new one that works better.

  This is my second laptop purchase from Amazon. First laptop was from Amazon seller it was returned. Asus is my new laptop sold by Amazon shipped by Amazon. I received  one recharge cable and laptop in box also a booklet about warranty info. Beautiful design slim. Screen is very clear. Setup was amazing voice app talked me all the way through setup. I had purchased a product key from Microsoft on my own because laptop comes with windows 10 S. I wanted to use Windows 10 only so I can download outside apps from Microsoft store. With Microsoft Windows S you cannot download outside apps. I entered my product key with ease and laptop started updating. It only took no more than 15 minutes. Everything is up to date. I also installed free one year subscription to Microsoft Office that came with laptop. There is an option to receive rewards points for Microsoft merchandise for just doing a survey every now and then. The surveys are by choice. It's fun and I'm receiving reward points that I can cash in for merchandise from Microsoft. I was able to download one of my favorite Google Apps CC Cleaner. The app was installed with ease and I was ready to scam my apps on laptop to keep bad files out of my laptop. It's a great app for phone or computers and it's FREE. I am enjoying my laptop. Hope customers give it a try.‚ô•Ô∏èThank you Amazon.

  I waited for 3 months for this beauty to become available after the CES 2019.As soon as it became available I ordered it. I wanted to compare it to my Pixelbook. (At twice the price or more). One of them could stay and one would have to go.Update: after more testing and comparison, I did the PB and decided to keep the C434!The C434 is a beautiful piece of hardware. Its aluminum finish is perfect.The screen is excellent compared to the Pixelbook it is not quite as bright and brilliant but very close.This is a widescreen versus the 3:4 on the PB. Looks good, better for movies, a bit awkward for use as a tablet.The keyboard is excellent. I'd call it a tie with the PB.Backlighting on the keyboard is good but n daylight it's better to turn it off as the letters on the keys are very hard to read.Trackpad smooth, again a tie.Weight goes to the Pixelbook which is about a pound lighter.Storage, even though the Asus has a micro sd card slot, the PB with 128 or 256 gb of internal storage gets the nod. Chrome seems to deal with internal storage more easily than the external card.Sound very nice for a laptop. Much better than the PB.Ports, they both have 2 USB C but the Asus adds a USB A 3.0.  Advantage Asus.It was a very close call, but I decided to keep the PB for a while longer. I bet I'll order the Asus within the next year though. Maybe with a larger HD and a faster processor when available.

  I purchased the C434 very near first availability date on Amazon after highly anticipating it's arrival.  I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  The build quality is excellent. The screen is amazing with those wonderful little bezels.  The screen is  bright and responsive and is a joy to look at and interact with in almost every respect.  The computer screams quality.  All of that said, after about three weeks with the C434, I decided to return it and ended up purchasing the HP X360.  Here are my reasons.One of the initial reviews of the C434 complained about the keyboard.  The person's complaint didn't relate to the tactile interaction with the keyboard (which is good) but rather to the viewing of the keys on the keyboard (white on metal).  My initial thought on this, prior to receiving my own C434, was that this reviewer must be very short-sighted to return the computer for such a minor  complaint.  However, he or she was absolutely correct.  In the spirit of creating a very contemporary keyboard, the white letters on the aluminum keyboard results in a very difficult layout to see in daylight.  I would need to tilt and move the keyboard to position my hands properly (and I type very fast by touch so this is not a hunt and peck complaint).  In dim light with the backlight on, the keyboard transforms into a wonderful experience, but using it during the day was a frustration for me I couldn't get over.I was also disappointed in performance.  Since I was an early adopter, I have the 4GB model with the core i3m processor.  For light web surfing and simple tasks it's fine, but if I wanted to view my Google photos, for example, or use the Android version of Lightroom from the App Store, there is a definite lag in performance.  I'm not sure if this relates to the 4GM of RAM or the i3m processor, but once I upgraded to the X360 (8 GB of RAM and a i3 U processor)  it was an entirely preferred performance experience.So, to conclude, here is my compare and contrast of the C434 with the HP X360.PriceThe HP X360 seems to be constantly on sale from it's $600 list price.  I got it for $450 but it can be had for as little as $399.  Great value at either of these reduced price options.  I was going to hold out for the C434 i5 with 8GB of RAM but I ultimately concluded that that price point would not come close to the X360 at its discounted price.ScreenThe C434 is brighter and much nicer and has those little bezels.  This is the one aspect of the C434 I miss the most.  The X360 has only a bearable screen brightness and color output as compared  to the C434, but ultimately  this was a tradeoff I was willing to make (although I still struggle with).WeightThe C434 is about 1/2 pound less in weight and is marginally smaller.  Again, I would opt for the C434 in this case but the real world difference is really not that significant.KeyboardI love typing on the X360. It's got a great feel and travel and nice backlight. The C434 was fine at night but that keyboard during the day was awful to use because of the white on metal.PerformanceHands down the X360 wins.  Ok , it has a fan that comes on occasionally, but it smokes the C434 with any use other than normal web surfing or simple applications. Using the X360 with the better processor and RAM is a joy compared to the C434.  Also, as an aside, I have noticed that Google Play Apps seem to run better on the X360 but I'm not sure why?  For example, I have an app that gives me notifications and when I clicked on the C434  it would not take me to the App but I have no problem at all with the X360 properly behaving in this regard.ConclusionIf you want a stylish Chromebook and your needs are limited to web surfing and light Applications, go for the C434.  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.

  This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Unfortunately, the screen has a white splotch in the center left, this is a glaring quality control issue. Also under heavy use, the screen will start glitching vertically. The display also skews yellow. There are several very questionable design issues and flaws. When the screen is open, the back of the notebook rests on the bottom of the display. This will put a lot of wear and tear on the casing and hinges. They've put two little rubber fingers here that stick out and will inevitably get caught on various things and get torn off. I really don't like the idea of the back end of the laptop sitting on its slick edge of the display and sliding around during use. The keyboard is not as light and snappy as the C302(which is one of the best IMO). And the biggest mistake of all is they made the keyboard silver which makes it very hard to read and make out symbols and characters compared to black keys. And the backlight doesn't contrast as well on a silver keyboard.  They've put a shiny chrome bevel around the edges which is not my taste. This silver bevel was also applied to the trackpad which is not as smooth. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.

  The laptop would be good, but it came with Mcafee ""anti-virus"" software that prevents you from activating Windows Defender even after the Mcafee anti-virus software is uninstalled. From now on I'm going to check if any computer I buy has Mcafee ""anti-virus"" software pre-installed because if you have it on your system and don't pay the subscription it will block access to Windows Defender regardless of whether you uninstall Mcafee or not. Asus should tell people in advance that they're expected to pay a monthly fee as well if they're going to force this software onto their customers for a cut of what the victims are paying the Mcafee company. I should be able to just use Windows Defender without having it blocked by the Mcafee sofware.

  I'm rating this computer five stars as it's a great computer for the price (i.e. the cheapest windows pc that you can find). I read through all of the reviews on this site, as well as others, and found that the reviews were pretty spot on. I definitely recommend checking out other reviews before buying to see if this is the right computer for you. My background: I'm actually a mac girl, but I needed a pc computer to run a particular type of software for grad school. I had the choice of sinking money into my '08 mac to fix a broken ram port, set up bootcamp, and buy windows for mac; OR just buying the cheapest windows pc I could find. I chose the latter as it was actually the cheaper (and faster) option and, so far, I'm happy with this computer's speed in running the software.Small details of note:*SUPER light plastic material - it's crazy how light this computer is.*Track pad is much more responsive than my previous computer and it took me a little while to get used to it. I actually thought that it wasn't tracking as it should due to a malfunction, but then realized that I was being too heavy-handed.*Windows 8 is pretty annoying on a computer that doesn't have a touchscreen, but you can customize it back to the regular desktop. To add to the track pad comment above, the track pad does allow you to expand/minimize with two fingers the way that you would on a touchscreen. Am currently undecided as to whether or not I find this feature useful.*Shorter power cord than I was expecting (not a dealbreaker by any means, but slightly annoying)*Purchased it for a total of $308 w/shipping and tax. I saw it for about $250 a few weeks previous, which I obviously would have preferred, but I'm still pretty happy with the price.

  It is a functioning laptop, but it has issues. One channel of the sound plug died afer a year, the charger died as well, and ASUS no longer carries them due to a design flaw, and the installation of Windows 10 onto thes laptop makes for a few headaches, such as displays that are too small, etc. Basically, I have had to learn to work around all of these glitches. Probably would not buy another one.

  This laptop is perfect for the casual professional type. It is not good for gaming as it can't even run minecraft with optifine. If you want to install lots of music dont it will only slow down your laptop. When I got this laptop it was on windows 8 and it was running fine, great even. But then i updated to 8.1 and the processor got slower and it started getting hotter. If you are looking for a laptop that can play games, dont buy this. I recommend you save up and build a desktop. But if you are not a gamer than this laptop should be just for you.

  With respect to the aspect everything is perfect for the cost, the only problem is that I wanted to check the memory and it turns out that it came with a 4GB and the description says of 8GB I am disappointed in this.  since one trusts what they are selling.

  ¬†This laptop has one of the worst TFT panel I have ever seen, there is literally no proper viewing angles. You will get distortion looking straight on. The monitor was poorly calibrated with WAY too much gamma, luckily adjusting this with Windows is trivial, I will get back to 'S Mode' later on. You will not be able to use this monitor for watching movies with a lot of dark scenes. If you are looking at the screen dead on the outer regions of black will be distorted to LIGHT grey.The keyboard is decent, the 10-key is a bit difficult with the keys not being the right size on the side. The button press is tactile and usable and the feel is fine enough for typing blind, which you shouldn't have to do since the keyboard is back-lit.The touch pad is okay, it's actually a bit too sensitive, the lower corners can be used as buttons but I would greatly prefer physical buttons like on the current Lenovo brand laptops. The touch pad has a fingerprint reader in the top right corner which interferes with the operation of the touch pad but at least the fingerprint reader is fast!The speakers are complete garbage, they have no semblance to actual sounds and it sounds like you are listening to a cellphone speaker through a wooden door. They are completely unusable for anything at all, do not buy this laptop if you enjoy playing anything on your speakers.The webcam is usable, but it's nothing to write home about, capping out at 720p/30fps it will feel like a power-point presentation more than a video feed on any video chat. The sound is about the same as phone quality. If you do video chats frequently, find another laptop.Back to windows and 'S Mode'. Windows is pre-installed, it had some of the latest updates already so it was recently installed. It doesn't have much bloatware, but having Skype installed is too much already. The ""type"" of Windows that is installed is called 'S Mode' which is basically a locked down completely restrictive version of Windows. You can't even download Chrome from the web you have to get it from the Microsoft store - Chrome being the first app I install on any Windows computer -. I removed 'S Mode' almost immediately.The laptop has 4Gb of non-removable memory and 4Gb of replaceable memory which is nice even though it's only single channel.The laptop is made from a plastic frame which I actually don't mind, it makes the laptop reasonably light, but it gives it a cheap experience. Opening the lid for example requires two hands or a technique, both of which is actually mildly inconvenient.Summary:The good: Decent keyboard and touch pad, fast loading web pagesIf you like a want a PC for viewing Netflix/media at home with no headphones, look somewhere else. If you want a PC for viewing Wikipedia/news then this will be decent but there are cheaper laptops that can do that better. If you have a fancy IPS monitor, you will hate this laptop. If you are even thinking about gaming, the answer is no.Seeing as this laptop has such limited uses with the horrible screen and speakers, I cannot give this laptop a better review that 3 stars. It's only purpose is to view webpages and basic coffee-shop work.

  looking for a great affordable laptop that can be used for school and personal use? This is the one.  It took like like 4 days to settle on what laptop to buy but I finally figured out this one would be it. There's not much youtube video reviews about this laptop but it is worth buying. Even if you aren't going to college, this is a great laptop for personal use. The backlit keyboards are a life saver for late night usage. The only problem (not the laptop itself) is windows 10, it took a while to install chrome because it was only allowing me to use Microsoft Edge browser but I figured it out it got chrome. If you need any help with this, just reply to me.

  I was looking for a laptop to replace my 8yo behemoth. My criteria were: lightweight, 8gb RAM, 64gb+ SSD, 1080p, with a full-sized HDMI port (no mini), Windows OS. I wanted it mostly for web browsing, word processing, and some fairly light gaming (modded Minecraft, Java version). After about a month, I am so far satisfied with this computer for all of those tasks.In fact, it surpassed my expectations in regards to gaming. I expected that it would be incapable of running more than a couple of mods, but so far it's taken everything I've thrown at it. I have not overclocked the processor (intentionally, anyway - perhaps windows does it automatically now?), and as such am operating at the stock 2.3Ghz (I think).I was slightly worried about purchasing this due to the reviews that commented about the screen quality/viewing angles. However, I am happy to report that I have not had any issues with screen visibility or warped edges. Perhaps I am simply plebian in my tastes, but it looks fine to me.It came with Windows 10 S, which I certainly did not want, but it was perfectly easy to disable.The backlit keyboard is honestly a lifesaver. I hadn't specifically sought out this feature, but it's fantastic. It comes with various brightnesses instead of a toggle, which frankly is unnecessary because the lowest setting is plenty bright. However, as mentioned in other reviews, it does cause a significant hit to battery life (or so it seems).The battery life is my only quibble, but admittedly, I believe that's mostly due to my usage rather than the machine itself. I have multiple Chrome tabs running at all times, as well as Visual Studio Code, and frequently Minecraft as well. At this level of usage, the battery lasts on average 2-3 hours. I haven't timed it though, so that is simply an estimate on my part.All in all, I am much happier with this $300 laptop than I was with my old laptop, which 8 years ago was twice the price. No doubt you can find better performance with a higher budget, but if you are tight on money, I highly recommend this device.

  I consider myself a bit of a Chromebook aficionado, I daily drive a max spec pixelbook, and I tinker with desktop PCs for fun...This laptop is NOT for me. That being said, I have parents that aren't particularly tech savvy, and they wanted a laptop that they could use to browse the web and maybe watch some youtube videos.This is one of the 3 or so models that I wouldn't feel terrible for buying them. It's big enough so that they can see things, and it has an ACTUAL IPS FHD screen (unlike some of the other, similarly priced Chromebooks which try and pass off 720p screens as ""HD""...be on the lookout for that!)It's got USB-C inputs, so it has some degree of future proofing, and it's got a relatively premium looking aesthetic, being made entirely of aluminum.So...buy it for your parents, or buy it for your younger child for school. At a little over $200, I honestly don't know how they're making money on this thing (however, anything over $300, and there are better alternatives).

  Awesome chromebook for my kid to do school work on while distance learning. Super easy set up. Looks nice. 1080p. Speedy. A lot of bang for your buck in this guy. Came with a sleeve and mouse as well. Bought her the non touch screen 14 inch 4RAM 32GB, HD, she loves it. I love it too, so much so that I ordered myself the 15.6 inch touch screen 4RAM N4200 64GB version. Great lap top for light office work, school work, surfing the internet/shopping. Chrome OS is simple. Great budget chromebook. Can‚Äôt wait for mine to arrive!! Thanks!UPDATE-----The 14 inch c423na is going strong works great for my kids schoolwork.I ordered myself the 15.6 inch version with the touchscreen and it sucked. The screen was wayyyyyyyy offf. colors not right at all! It was super bright like it was broken or something. My cell phone looked better. Bummer had to send it back. From what I am seeing in the reviews now is that the 15.6 inch C524na version of these chromebooks seem to be very defective. My kids c423na 14 in has a very good quality picture! So not sure why the larger version is such a piece of crap! sad. Good luck!

  Chromebook purchased for my son to use in college.  The actual office products do not have Times New Roman font as required by all his professors.  All research indicates no solution other than use Google docs, which does not allow him to edit files saved on his external drive.  This is very problematic.  I am disappointed as Chromebook is touted as a student laptoo, but does not allow the required font to use?We may have to return the Chromebook and get a laptop that allows office use with Times New Roman.

  I had two of these fail on me during normal operation.  Asus product support claims that the warranties are void because--I kid you not--the products broke.These machines have very cheap plastic parts in the USB ports, and they crack easily during normal use; a fact Asus did not dispute.  But when I sent one in with a broken webcam, they refused to fix it because the plastic bit on the USB port was cracked.  It's not anywhere near the camera, nor is it due to anything I did.  They want $140 to fix the webcam because they declared the warranty void.Instead, I'm going to replace this with something from a more reputable company.  If you're reading this, learn from my example and skip this cheap machine.

  I love this thing, so much so that I bought the blue one for my fiance, and she loves it too. I have owned MacBooks, I have a gaming PC that I built, but when it comes to productivity, this laptop takes the cake. I love having everything on my Google Drive, and sharing things is super easy. It took a little to get used to the unfamiliar Chrome OS, but its so clean and simple. Surprisingly, my external HD with all my movies plugs in and works great on here too. Google has a media player that plays .mkv files perfectly. Also, I was surprised with how much audio the speakers put out, especially for a 200$ laptop. Last but not least, the battery lasts forever.

  While this Chromebook does the job for my son in middle school, I'm getting ready to send it in for repairs for the second time because it keeps losing Chrome OS which renders the notebook useless. The recovery from google.com/chromeos/recovery doesn't work. So I'm spending $30 again to send it in for repair which takes 7-10 days AFTER they receive the notebook into their system. Super inconvenient. Thankfully I purchased a 3 year warranty or else I fear I would be out the $200 that I paid for the Chromebook. If I can't get this to work, I'm going to have to purchase an actual computer for him.

  Pro's:  -  This works exactly as a chromebook is supposed to work.  -  The battery lasts a long time  -  The screen is clear and has nice resolution  -  Very light and portable  -  Google chrome is the only web browser I use because it is the bestCon's:  -  I do not like being restricted to just chrome apps, I gave it a shot and wasn't happy about it.  -  It can be hard to open when fully closed because the screen and the keyboard section fit together a little too well, hard to get a finger  nail in there if you don't have any. minor issue but it can be the little things sometimes.  -  There is no delete button or caps lock  -  This wasn't advertised in the prodcut and this isn't a complaint by any means, but the black keyboard is hard to see in the dark because  it is not lit up.  -  You cannot use Microsoft word, excel, or powerpoint. (obviously)Over all, this is a great product but I did not like it due to how restrictive it was in what programs you can download. There is a massive selection of apps in the chrome store but it still wasn't enough for me.

  The keyboard will not work for more than 6 weeks.  The first unit was replaced under warranty because the SHIFT keys stopped working.  After almost 2months of being in the service area or in the mail...ASUS sent me a replacement unit, then the ""new"" one they sent me only worked for 6weeks before the T and Y keys stopped working.  This one goes back in the mail tomorrow.  They are inexpensive up front, but when you realize that you won't even get a consistent 6weeks of use from it...then it becomes a major expense ($200 = 2 months of aggravation interspersed with 6 weeks of functional work at a time)

  8/14/18 UPDATE: went to use it yesterday and it would not turn on. Complete black screen, unresponsive. It was so great while it lasted, but now Asus is asking that I pay shipping to have it sent back for repair, even though it‚Äôs under a year warranty. Ridiculous.‚ÄîI made this purchase over a month ago, just to make sure that my review was fair. I paid a little over 170 dollars for this chromebook. I am a writer who primarily uses google docs. I only need a laptop/chromebook for this function, plus research. Occasionally I play music from YouTube.This isn't the best CB on the market. It's a little slow. It's plastic. It feels frail in your hands. There isn't a ten key on the side, or a delete button. The caps button is actually a search function, but that can be changed in the settlings. It's kind of small.But it was 170 dollars. It's functional. It doesn't shut down on me randomly. It always loads pages and my documents. It's not so slow that it's unbarable to use. The battery life is FANTASTIC. It's cute. It fits into most laptop sleeves/bags.The people on here complaining because it isn't perfect are being pretty unreasonable. The price for this (and its brand new?!) is amazing. I was in a situation where I needed something for my work and fast. I didn't have a lot of money or time to research. I was nervous based on some of these reviews. But this little thing saved me just in time. It got to my house in two days (thank you prime!) and has been reliable ever since. If your situation is similar (you're a writer, a student, ect) it will be perfect for you.

  Bought this Vivobook Flip for my wife on Dec. 22. It was supposed to be here today the 31st. Surprise! Arrived on Monday the 28th. That was awesome! I have to say I was nervous about the purchase from this vendor with no reviews posted at the time and right now it looks like I'm only the second to write a review. I don't write reviews by the way. But since there weren't any, and I currently couldn't be happier, Here you go. This is really a nice little unit. Does exactly what it says and does it well. There are many reviews on YouTube, etc. where you find the specs. So, I won't bother with the that. For what it is, it's very responsive. Boots quick and has a pretty zippy feel to it. Looks great and the ability to flip it into a tablet is a pretty cool trick. The touchscreen is very sensitive. As in just right. Is it a powerhouse of storage? No, but if you need a light duty machine for whatever, this should take care of it for you. It came nicely packaged and all original with Asus factory seals on the box. I am an Asus fan anyway, but this was a really nice surprise and my wife loves it. Just right for what she needs. I did click it out of S mode at initial setup. I would encourage that. Again. If you need muscle look at one of the Vivobooks with stronger specs. If not, this is your machine. Oh, and I paired it up with the Tecknet bluetooth mouse. Take care now.

  I bought this renewed because it was 100 dollars cheaper. Big mistake I'm sure some renew are OK but the one I received terrible. As soon as I open the box, the chromebook was already on with the screen saying OS is missing or damaged. After recovered the keyboard stopped.

  An i3 and 4gb RAM, 500GB HDD at 5400RPM, it's all around a great computer. The CPU is hyper threaded, so it essentially has 4 cores.Not great for gaming though, but here is what it can run:BanishedBully: Scholarship EditionCounter-Strike: Global OffenseDon't Starve (And the ""together"" standalone game)TES V:SkyrimEuro truck Simulator 2Grand Theft Auto 1, 2, 3, Vice City, San AndreasLEGO WorldsPortalPortal 2South Park: Stick Of TruthSpintiresStar Wars: Battlefront I & IISuper HexagonTeam Fortress 1 & 2Terrariaand basically any other Source Engine powered game, but expect to turn down settings and even the resolution.But good laptop, great construction, some flex on the keyboard, and comes with Windows 8, so I'd recommend installing updates, then upgrading to 8.1 then going to 10.

  This computer was beautiful and fully compact but that's about it.  The setup proved that the volume buttons on the key pad weren't attached to the computer.  And most importantly; one month after purchase the computer is continuously shutting down with a click.  Last night was the last straw when it got so hot that it sparked and went poof! before shutting itself down.I cant imagine that I am so elementary that I could have done that to a brand new computer so chances are the computer was a faulty one, but guess what, I had a one month window to make exchanges.  OH btw, I live in the Caribbean so that was virtually impossible since mail takes at least two weeks to get on my island.That said, I am pretty much stuck with a useless computer that I paid 400US dollars which in Eastern Caribbean currency is EC$1 086.76 plus shipping, handling, tariffs and custom duties since I have to pay from one state to another and then from Florida to the island.  What a waste...

  My asus 1015pn finally died and was looking for a replacement and the x200la seems to fit the bill.Runs cool, nice screen  graphics, about the same size as the 1015pn.  Hardware uses w8 64 bit and w8.1 64 bit. Has  I3 cpu resulting in a faster unit than the 1015pn and also has 4 gig ram . Not really  a game machine but a good work on the road unit..  Item was shipped in a timely fashion and  case looks ok. Would have liked an all aluminum case .. Would also have  liked a 1 terabyte  7200 hd .. has  500 gig 5400 rpm hd .. Also noticed that unit has an Asus x200ca manual on desktop pdf file.  You can  also download  it from web site. Suggest you become familiar with page 78, entering the  bios screen from boot to page 92 or so  recovery..  Also noticed that  the x200ca laptop has drivers for w7 64 but the x200la does not. Suspect these are similar laptops and probably the x200la would run w7 64 with x200ca drivers.  May test in the near future. Note .. Unit does ""not"" come with a dvd drv but external usb  dvd  easily obtained for 40-45 dollars or so from various web suppliers . Suggest you get one..Unit came running w8 and I updated the bios to latest issue downloaded from ASUS web then did conversion from w8 to the free w8.1. Took 4 hrs to complete updates.( over 100)but need to do all updates in order to download/install w8.1..Prepare yourself to kill 1 day doing the w8 updates, w8 image backup,  w81 download, and conversion.  But it is worth it, to get ease of use and speed increase. Tip:  After  w8 updates are completed suggest  downloading using the latest free Belarc advisor program first to identify/display your  w8key ,among other things, as there will not be an Microsoft  sticker key tag on your unit to display same.  You may need the  w8 key in the future. TIP ..don't try to do all 100 + updates at once otherwise you might get a config failure and  get to reload the w8 os from the hidden part and naturally  get  start over(3 hrs wasted)  Suggest do 10 updates at a time  and let the unit config the updates then repeat.Will take about 4 hrs but it works first time.. Next download w8.1 from the ms store and let it install ... takes 5 + hrs  and  high speed connection might be a little faster. . Let w8.1 do the 6 or so updates and your system will be ready.Now take the time to learn the differences between w7 and  w8.1..especially  pc image creation and  backup/restore  in the cloud.Will update as more use is accomplished. So far so good, I would recommend this product.. jackpupdate 8-19-14........Laptop still running well  now using w8.1 pro 64bitTip...  How to boot from external device  dvd or usb  (procedure not in  asus manual.. but maybe should be)Enter bios  setup using key f2/disable fast boot/enable csm/disable secure boot control in secure boot menu/exit and save/ let laptop start/ now reboot/now shutdown/connect usb thumb drv or usb dvd drv/cold start/select boot menu during initial start up using esc key/select boot device/ go to work..jporter

  My review is taking into consideration the cost of the unit and the intended purpose.  This little laptop is very inexpensive but comes with some nice features.  For less than $500 you get an Intel i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 3 USB ports, one of which is a USB 3.0, a touch screen and Windows 8.0 (not the greatest).  I believe that this is a bargain because it has more than what many tablets plus keyboard would cost.  It is a full laptop with all of the advantages of laptops over the limitations of tablets.If all you want to do is surf the web, watch videos, write email and word processing, then this more than meets your needs.  The keyboard is adequate for typing with hands the size of my hands.  It can show HD online videos without a problem and you can have several tabs open in your browser. Because it is very light in weight, it is easily portable and comfortable to sit on your lap. Sounds great? Of course there are a few negatives.The unit is made out of plastic and the trackpad is the weak spot.  It makes a lot of noise when clicking and feels cheap.  For a unit equipped with an Intel Haswell i3, the battery life is not great if you watch a lot of videos. That is what I do a lot, so I can't tell you how long it will last just surfing the web, but for what I do with it, 4 hours would be about the maximum.  And we do not want to forget that it comes with Windows 8.0 and not Windows 8.1.Upgrading this machine from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 was not an easy task.  In order to upgrade to the more recent operating system you have to bring your Windows 8 system up to date by installing all of the updates.  There are about 100 updates for Windows 8 and if you let the computer do all of them at once you may run into problems.  I did.  After hours of downloading and installing the updates, Windows failed on configuring the updates.  Another reviewer here has a method that should work better by only updating a few updates at a time.  Once Win 8 has been updated, then the installation of Win 8.1 was not a problem and worked without a glitch.Even considering the negatives, and there are always some, at this price it is worth buying. Just don't expect that you are getting a Macbook Air.

  This item from Tiger Direct arrived in a box sealed with an ASUS sticker.  When I opened it there where minor scratches inside and out suggesting this was, at best, an open box item that had been repackaged.  It was a gift, so I didn't have time to return it. So Tiger Direct one, this customer zero.  As for the computer, it seems to work fine. I like everything but the loud clicking mouse pad.  It took some time to upgrade to Windows 8.1, but it went without a hitch. The processing time isn't that great, but probably as good as it gets at this price range.  All in all, I like the computer, but disappointed in Tiger Direct.

  I bought this laptop at just a little over $450.  My Vaio finally bit the dust, and I was looking for something in the $500 range that could potentially serve as my primary PC as my desktop has also been nearing the end of its life.This computer has far exceeded my expectations.  I'm actually using it as my primary PC now, with all my peripherals plugged in via USB hub.The hardest I generally push it is playing Classic WoW (on med/high settings) with maybe a Twitch stream or a YouTube video playing in the background, and it's handled that so far very well.I'm not going to ding the rating due to bloatware, Windows 10, etc. because these are known factors when buying a computer, so I won't fault Asus for that.The fingerprint reader does the job well, and I really like the form-factor.  It's very slim, portable, but I'm not sure this computer will stand up to too much abuse.  I suspect part of the reason for the great price is that the laptop is probably a little fragile.  I'm also not a huge fan of the location of the power button, so be careful when you need to use the delete button-it's one button to the left of where it normally is.  But again, this isn't a huge inconvenience.From pressing the power button to being fully immersed in Classic Wow, or a video, or surfing the web, takes less than 20s.  The SSD in this thing makes a HUGE difference.Even with 3-5 USBs connected, and using HDMI to connect to my monitor, etc., the temp has stayed very cool.  My Vaio would get incredibly hot toward the end of its life, even with a cooling fan underneath, but this ASUS barely gets warm to the touch.I was able to squeeze nearly 10 years out of my Vaio, so hopefully this one has the same lasting power.All-in-all, I'm super pleased with this purchase.  I'd recommend it to anyone in the $500 range.Edit: I wanted to check in at the (almost) year mark from when I purchased this just to say that it's running just as well as the day I bought it.  I've treated it very well, kept it clean, and it's in great shape.  What really impressed me so far has been the graphics-for a mobile device, the Radeon Vega graphics.  I never had a major preference toward Radeon/nVidia, so when I bought this laptop, I just wanted something that could do some light gaming and handle any other daily tasks, and I've continued using it as my primary PC and it's still trucking.  Easily worth 400-500 still, IMO.

  This is a perfect laptop for a college student and with the specs it has + backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner, it's amazing for the price. The screen isn't IPS but it's still very good and anti-glare. The build quality doesn't seem cheap at all. Keep in mind this laptop is not a gaming laptop so it won't handle games like Overwatch and Fornite in high settings. Some people complain about the power button being next to delete key, but that's a extremely small issue and you shouldn't pay attention to that. This is a great laptop for a college student who needs it for everyday personal and business use!

  While I don't expect a high end experience on a laptop this price, I do have to say I'm disappointed by the viewing angle of the display. Vertical washout occurs if you do not have the screen tilted EXACTLY at the correct angle. Contrast and color vividness is also poor. I frequently purchase laptops in this price range, and have seen much better displays on others. Don't be leave the 178 degree viewing angle advertised. :(It should also be noted that the integrated graphics reserve 2GB of RAM. This means the laptop only has 6GB available for the OS. I have not found a way to reduce the amount reserved.Otherwise, the laptop is stylish, thin, light weight, and a fairly snappy performer. It's a shame the display is so bottom basement.

  I went through most of the competition when selecting a hybrid and selected the Taichi as meeting all of my needs.  It has been more than a month and I am happy with my choice. Most of what can be said has been said by other reviewers, but I have one essential suggestion to add.Initially the Taichi infuriated me to no end with quirks and bugs such as the screen not flipping properly when opening the lid and the touchscreen and touchpad not recognizing some essential windows 8 gestures. It was bad enough that I considered returning the computer and waiting for the Asus transformer book, however a curious thing happened. While trying to delete the restore partition and reclaim disk space I completely borked the SSD partitions forcing me to re-install windows 8 with a retail Windows 8 Disc and reload the drivers.  I downloaded all of the latest drivers from support.asus (Use the support address because the Taichi product page support link wont have the drivers) and ever since everything works flawlessly.  This means that the Taichi is shipping with faulty outdated drivers. A complete reformat should not be necessary, but be sure to download all of the drivers and install them over the currently installed drivers.NOTE: On my Taichi without reformatting the SSD it would have been impossible to increase the size of my C partition because of an immovable 4GB system partition sitting between it and the recovery partition.  If you can get around that, you'll end up with 117GB of usable space.The Taichi isn't perfect (proprietary SSD interface, No built in SD reader, no inside touch), but I felt it worthy of 5 stars because there is nothing in the market I would trade it for.

  Nice try, interesting concept, etc. Just not worth the pain in the neck. Waste of money. Was not a fun introduction to the hybrid/convertible market. Big mistake. I wrote a very positive review and wanted to like it last year, but it just got worse and worse after about the 4th month of owning it and using it.First of all mine is now sitting in a shelf in my closet. I will sell it to you for $100.After 1 year of using this thing and taking care of it, here is my experience:It was fun at first, but also very buggy from the start. For example auto screen brightness has never worked.Update to windows 8.1 was a disaster, went back to 8, and never bothered again.Battery is pathetic, and my charging port is also bad like an Achilles heal. I spent $150 repairing this at local shop (warranty won't cover this, bastards), but it still sucks. Gotta position the charger tip a certain wa in the port in order to make good contact and charge.Mirror mode hasn't worked for a few months. Not interested in sending in back to Asus for repair, because they hold onto it for a couple weeks, and this is my work laptop.Laptop performance is generally unreliable. The display sometimes gets stuck upside down. Switching between tablet screen and laptop screen is buggy, quirky, unreliable. And also embarrassing if you are doing it in front of people because it usually fails to switch smoothly and reliably. Just extremely buggy.The port on the left side broke after 6 months. That is the serial port adaptor. So that leaves me with two USB ports and a mini HDMI port. The one thing this baby does well is adapt to multiple monitors. I have to use a USB hub and various j5 graphic adaptors, but it works well, and that is the only reason I still use this thing at work.I never use the tablet screen because it is to buggy to be functional for work tasks.The back lit keyboard is nice, but it is buggy too. Sometimes it fluctuates from dim to bright and bright to dim for no reason.Another huge frustration, and this is common for me with Asus laptops, is that I can't get the power options to work consistently. The power options seem to reset, for example in terms of what closing the lod does or when to hibernate. This week I walked from it for a couple hours. It had a full battery when I walked away. It should have hibernated. It didnt. Maybe this is a conflict between Asus ware and the Microsoft ware.This was my first foray into the hybrid market. I learned a lot with this puppy. Just biding my time until I can justify purchasing something more reliable.Really need a portable with reliable battery, reliable charging, reliable power settings. This machine fails in all 3. This is a basic and important characteristic that is hard to find in modern electronics.

  I purchased this machine in March, 2015 and I love the dual display and have not had any issues with the hardware. I upgraded to windows 8.1 and here is where I had a lot of problems with the dual screens not switching correctly. However, it seems ASUS and Microsoft have this worked out and ASUS provides the correct display drivers on their support website. Also, I believe the current windows 8.1 upgrade package now contains updated drivers that work correctly. This machine is blazing fast and I'm glad I updated to windows 8.1 even though it took a lot of hours to figure out the driver issues.I did discover that once I installed Office 360 and a few other programs that I now don't have much storage space left but I just use a USB or OneDrive if needed. If your wanting a laptop solution for home office or to keep a lot of personal files, then this is not the laptop for you. Get one with a hard drive rather than just a SSD. I have to admit, the price is great considering it's power. I use mine both like an iPad and a laptop which is great and I absolutely love it. Microsoft's store still needs a lot of work but it's getting their.Here are my recommendations for this machine: If your not familiar with Start8, you should download the free trial since the Start button has been removed from windows 8/8.1 and this handy little utility restores this feature. Reset your power settings to shutdown when the power button is pushed since the boot up only take a few seconds. Also, the sleep mode sometimes causes issues with the dual display functionality. If your brave, go ahead and upgrade to 8.1 but take the link from the ASUS support website for the Taichi 21. If you have trouble with the dual display working correct, download the bios update and display driver updates as they resolve these issues

  I had a chromebook for a couple of years because it was cheap.  When I finally got tired of the limitations of that laptop I started searching on-line for the best reasonably priced computer.  I looked at all the big name models  with touch screen and without.  My wife had an ASUS for several years and I was impressed with the features.  When I saw this one with a 17 inch screen, solid state storage, fast processor and windows 10 not 10S I jumped on it.  I bought it for less than $500.  Can't beat that.

  In the past two months I have purchased and returned a Lenovo (highest volume was maybe HALF of any other computer I've had and boot up was incredibly slow); an HP (despite reload of Windows10 with HP tech giving instructions by phone, still couldn't get laptop to recognize internal DVD drive and I bought it to load music on to) and now I have come to the conclusion I need to return this ASUS. I only kept it this long because I just could not believe I was in this position for a third time... WTF?!!This VivoBook17 crashes at least once a night EVERY NIGHT. I think it has to do with the auto updates. It freezes for as long as 5 minutes and Ctrl/Alt/Del does not work. Maybe I should call ASUS support but I'm so disheartened, I may not waste my time. If something brand new doesn't work properly, do you want to fix it or do you want something that is perfect right out of the box? I returned the Lenovo to Office Depot up the street. I had to pay $40 to return the HP to an Amazon seller who did not provide for free returns. This one was purchased from Amazon so I am hopeful the return will be free.I bought this laptop because I wanted the largest possible screen (17.3) for my heavy-use streaming (Hulu, Netflix, Prime, HBO, etc.). I also wanted to finally load all my music on one of my computers and it might as well be the newest one. This one is going back but here's how I would rate it:Pros: the screen is large enough for good viewing, the color and clarity are sharp and the volume is great. It boots up quickly and I like the large keyboard buttons. I like that the weight is moderate and not too heavy. The appearance is okay, although I like the look of my old (2013) red ASUS better. My old ASUS had TERRIBLE wireless connectivity and I was happy to find this one had no connectivity issues.Cons: I HATE Windows10 and I believe the issues with this computer are due to the OS and not the equipment itself, but I am not a tech expert and I don't care WHY the problem is, I only want a working and reliable laptop with a 17-inch screen. So here I go back to shopping. Don't know if I'll stick with ASUS or try a fourth brand since, apparently, getting a good product has more to do with luck than with brand name or reputation.

  Computer boots fast and operates quickly. Those are pluses. The big negative for me is the battery life. I have had the computer for just about two weeks, and the longest it has stayed on with a full battery is 90 minutes. That's inconvenient when I am in a meeting that lasts more than that time.

  Product description says this has backlighting for the keyboard; it does not. The lettering is difficult-to-impossible to read in any kind of lighting. Looking at the keyboard it is easy to believe it was INTENDED to have backlighting in the original design but someone forgot to include it in the construction. To 'see' the letters, I had to shine a flashlight at an angle to the keyboard. Tech support responded this was not a glitch, the computer doesn't have it. Can't say much about other features as this was a deal-breaker, and I re-boxed it shortly after starting it.

  Seems great, everything installed correctly and booted up normally. Bought this laptop for my father who is going to be using it for work after having back surgery.Laptop is nice in size, but the reason I rated it only 2 stars is because there is a mark on the top side of the laptop which makes me believe this is a used model? I‚Äôve never purchased a tech item that is scratched before, and the listing showed new.Pretty disappointed and cannot return due to this taking almost a week to get to me and he needs it for work. Next time I will look somewhere else for a laptop.

  I have only had this for a couple days now.  I was replacing an old Dell XPS13 - I like to have a light, smaller notebook to carry with me.Sizewise, this was just what I expected.  It is a little thicker than my 10 year old XPS 13, but I'm thicker than I was 10 years ago too.  Nothing at all overwhelming - not like a full notebook with a CD drive, etc.The screen is fine - compared to my Surface Book, it doesn't seem as vibrant, but so far so good.  Have not tried to use it in full sunlight yet, which I hear can be an issue, but that's true for most things.  The touch seems responsive as well.  The fold-it-to-a-tent or tablet mode work just fine.  The hinge is a bit hesitant to move which is a good thing, but feels solid.Performance wise, it runs great.  I've mostly been installing software, but the network connection has been solid, the SSD is great, and it just feels very responsive.  I haven't thrown too much at it, but GIMP and Visual Studio seem fine.The only downside that was mentioned in other reviews as well is the sound.  The speakers are on the bottom of the unit.  This is most likely so if you put it into tent mode to watch something, the sound is (mostly) projected at you.  It is still very usable, but depending on where you set it, what material, etc, it could be muffled.  This doesn't affect me, as when I use it, I'd have headphones in, but while it boasts Harmon-Kardon sound, the design negates any benefit from that ""premium"".  It'd be like buying a Monet, and then putting it in a room with no light.The webcam that is built in seems low-quality.  The video from it wasn't that great, and it felt like about 15 frames-per-second.  Then again, me in front of the camera doesn't help the video image either, but if you're doing a lot of Zoom/etc that may be an issue for you.The only other complaint was the Window install - I do not want to use a Microsoft account to sign in, which is nothing specific to this notebook - but it would have been easier to not put it on wireless, setup a local account, and then connect it to the network.  By putting it on the network first, there was no way to skip the Microsoft Account requirement.

  I like the smaller size that this laptop offers.  It will be easier to travel with.  The color is very good.  It was hard to get used to no number pad on the right side (only have the numbers on top now).The thing I don't like is it needs to have the battery charged more often.  I don't have as much usage before it needs to be recharged.

  I think over all it could be a really good buy, but the integrated graphics (Vega 8) takes up 2 GB of ram which wasn't listed. This leave you with 6 gb of ram. thats 55-60% memory use without applications running. I returned it since throwing more memory could instead go to something with independent graphics card and memory for it.

  Having set up quite a few computers over the years, I was dreading this one since it seamed that as the years went by, more and more bloatware was being installed which takes a long time to clean out and have a relatively clean install.  I was surprised that this install was relatively clean!  The usual MS, Google, Security, Updates, and other essentials were pretty straight forward to set up. After about two days, everything was running smoothly and no further problems have occurred.I would, and have recommended this laptop to others.  It's fast, has a good screen, and does everything I need a computer for.

Oh, and I'm super excited that I can upgrade this for more memory and customize it more as I go.

  I was completely disappointed with my purchase, due to the fact I ordered it and got on a day I embarked for international studies in Barbados. As a university student that received a product that was not functioning properly I can't say how much I'm disappointed with this purchase.  The screen keeps blinking and screen keeps freezing rom ever since I opened the box and unable to return it due not being in the US at the moment. Completely disappointing purchase.

  This review was originally only for the first unit I received. I have since been sent two replacements which had issues as well.UNIT ONE- The trackpad was not set evenly‚Äîthe top right corner of the trackpad stuck up slightly higher than the surrounding border‚Äîand responded inconsistently.- When closed, the top half of the laptop was misaligned with the bottom half.- One of the USB-C ports had stopped working by the second time I plugged into it (it had only been used with the included charger, and only once before failure).- The touchscreen was barely responsive, and when it decided to work, it felt like first generation touchscreen tech. I couldn't even use the onscreen keyboard unless I left about half a second between presses to let it process.UNIT TWO- The trackpad was not set evenly (turns out this is just how they‚Äôre made‚Äîthe third unit had the exact same issue).- One of the rubber feet on the back edge of the screen was installed backward and did not allow the seam between the metal body and plastic strip under the screen to close, leaving a crack that spanned the entire space between the two hinges.I didn‚Äôt even turn this one on before I requested a return, so there may very well have been other issues that I never took the time to encounter.UNIT THREE- Same uneven trackpad.- The seam between the metal body and plastic strip under the screen was slightly warped.- The touchscreen worked well when it worked, but it would occasionally stop working until I restarted the computer.- The left CTRL key had a concave bend in it which caused it to make a strange clacking sound and sometimes not respond to presses.Heed the negative reviews‚Äîthe quality control really is as bad as they make it sound. Unless you're okay with trying until you get one that isn't a lemon (and praying that nothing fails down the road), you might want to look elsewhere.

  First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing. First impressions after 1 week:Pros:1. Great size. The footprint is amazing considering the screen size. I have a 15 inch laptop that is the same size. Pretty thin and the keyboard is not cramped at all imo.2. Screen. Crisp, bright when you need it, bezels are just amazing. Colors are amazing. I just love looking at this screen. It really looks great every time you open it up.3. Keyboard. There are some negatives to the keys, but the good thing is the travel and feel of the keys. It's the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. Although I've mostly had work issued ones to this point. Backlight keys are great at night but suffer during the day. More on that in the cons....4. Performance. No issues with multiple tabs and apps running. Again I got the 8gb model to help with this.5. Weight. No issues with the 3lb weight, but haven't used it in tablet mode that much so far.6. Build ... Very nice build quality. It really feels like a premium device in your hands. Would have liked to see a glass trackpad but this one feels pretty good. If you have $1000+ ""pro"" laptops you are used to you might not like it. If you are coming from a $500 laptop then you will probably love this pad. It does have a nice solid click and it's not ""loose"" feeling. Hinges are solid with very little wiggle.Cons:1. Backlighting... during the day and at the right angle, the keys are almost blurred out so much that you can't see what key is what. I wish they redid the character cut outs or changed the lighting so that during the day they stood out more. At night though, I love it since there is more contrast.2. Touch pad. Not an awful pad by any means, just not glass which would have made this imo a lot better.3. No pen. I was hoping to be able to use a stylus but from what I can tell so far, you can only use one of those generic tipped pens that are out there.... if someone knows of a nice surface style pen that works with this please let me know! Seems like if you go through the trouble of making a convertible laptop, it should be compatible with a nice pen too. Perhaps I'm just not aware of it yet.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.

  Besides it being advertised with a backlit keyboard it's great computer everything checks out otherwise and have had no problems.. Went though 3 replacements just to be sent the same wrong color and no backlit keyboard all 3 times even though I actually like the grey color better than the all black.. Amazon compensated me for the difference so decided to just settle since I truly needed it for work and couldn't wait any longer.. Would advise buying directly from a store in person but sometimes you dont have many options and this is by far not the worst route.. No issues with the screen as so many reviews mention and had pretty decent FOV.. Other than the mishap several times this computer would of got a 5 star review which I don't think it was asus fault.. Definitely be weary which company you buy from because alot are remanufactured or have the wrong hardware that do not match the specs fortunately this was did.. Arrived ahead of schedule each time and not in only the manufacturers packing.. Great buy as long as you don't need a backlit keyboard which I truly don't but is a great feature to have especially when for the same money many other companies offer touchscreen and backlit.. Overall not super upset having to settle because the laptop is performing better than expected..

  I really wanted to like this notebook. I purchased it in December and really have not had a chance to use until this week (I have a fully equipped home office and pc). I have to travel this week and thought this would be a good time to try it out. What I found was that it does not have a backlit keyboard as stated in the item description. I have tried everything, every recommended key combination - all to no avail. I finally noticed that there is not a keyboard key. It is of course too late to return or exchange it and I am just out of luck. Be warned, if you want a backlit keyboard DO NOT BUY THIS NOTEBOOK. I was unable to get any help or support.

  Just unpacked my new laptop, first time for an Asus. I have most of my customizing done and so far I love it.Update - I find the touchpad too sensitive for my liking. There is no slide adjustment, just low, medium and high sensitivity. Also, the speakers seem to be on the bottom of the laptop so most of the sound gets absorbed by whatever it is sitting on. Not impressed.Also, and this is probably not Asus-specific, Windows File Explorer keeps offering multiple instances of various folders, making it difficult to tell what is stored on the computer and what is on OneDrive. Again, not impressed. I permanently lost some files trying to get rid of what I thought were extra copies.

  This is my initial review after only having this laptop for a few days.  I did an detailed search for a good replacement notebook and ended up purchasing this laptop for better or worse.When I first received the laptop I heard rattling inside the case.  I took the bottom panel off, (when replacing the HDD with a Solid State drive I found two loose screws and pieces of plastic fragments on top of the motherboard just rolling around.  I didn't see any missing screws, so whoever assembled this laptop must have dropped them inside and never bothered to check for anything loose before putting it together.  It's a good thing it didn't short something out.  Bad quality control ASUS!This is a very nice looking notebook.  It has an aluminum display back and what looks like aluminum where the keyboard is. It's actually just plastic.  Everything else is also plastic.  The problem with the metal plating on the back of the display is that it is a finger print magnet and they are very difficult to remove.  The metal is just for show and really doesn't add to the build quality vs. a laptop that is all plastic.It has a very fast Intel I5 processor which is crippled by the very slow Samsung 1TB 5400rpm hard drive.  You can replace the hard drive  with a solid state drive by taking the bottom panel off and carefully prying it past the locking tabs all the way around the frame.  I used a thick guitar pick and the bottom panel came off rather easily.  There are 4 screws holding the HDD caddy in place.  Once I replaced the HDD the performance was a monumental improvement.  It's obvious the CPU was constantly waiting on the slow drive, making this laptop feel really slow.  Boot times before were easily over a minute and after, with the SSD, it booted in less than 8 seconds.There is no DVD drive,  so you will have to buy an external if needed.ASUS uses like 6 partitions on the HDD which is ridiculous.  You get a C: partition for the OS and applications and a D: partition for data.  I'm OK with this, but there are also multiple hidden partitions for restore and recovery.  When I installed the SSD I just migrated the two OS partitions and made one large C drive on a 500GB Samsung EVO 850 SSD, saving a lot of space.  I created an image of the original HDD so if I ever need to put it back to factory condition, I have the image on hand.  I'll use the 1TB internal HDD as an external backup drive.  By the way, the Samsung EVO Solid State drives are very affordable and work great.  I have installed more than 10 of them now without a hitch.  Why laptop manufacturers aren't putting SSD's in laptops now that the prices have dropped is beyond me.The display was a big disappointment to me.  It's a high resolution 1080p display but it is very dim and it has virtually no contrast.  You just can't seem to adjust it to get a sharp image. It's not terrible, it's just not very good.  Below average I would call it.  The screen is very hard to read and has a glossy finish to it which makes it virtually impossible to use in any kind of bright lighting condition.  Bad decision ASUS!  They obviously saved money on this panel.  It's a standard TN panel and a cheap one at that.  I played around a little with the touch screen and it works fine.  This may be the saving grace for the terrible touch pad - (see below)I believe you can also upgrade the RAM from 8GB to 12GB's even though ASUS says you can't.  There is a metal box over the memory with a single 4GB stick in it.  The other is built into the motherboard which you can't replace.  If you take the metal cover off, you should be able to replace the 4GB stick with an 8GB one.  You also can replace the battery once you have the bottom panel off.The next disappointment was with the touch pad.  It's very sensitive and if you use any pressure at all, it just doesn't respond.  What's even worse is there are no software adjustments for sensitivity.  Why laptops manufacturers can't make a decent touch pad is frustrating.  It's an essential component for using a laptop and this one just plain sucks.  The left and right buttons are incorporated into the pad and are very hard to press.  T I ended up using a Logitech wireless trackball with it, but this defeats the purpose of using it as a LAP top.The speakers are just fair.  ASUS touts how great the sound is, but in actuality, it is worse than my 7 year old cheap Lenovo laptop.  This is just marketing hype - don't buy it.  Not much to brag about here.The keyboard is also pretty bad.  It works, but has a cheap plastic feel to it.  Manufacturers have all gone to the chicklet keyboard which is not an improvement IMO.  I still love the old IBM Thinkpad keyboard on their older laptops.  Unfortunately, even Lenovo has gone away from them to make more profit using cheap keyboards.Another annoying thing about this laptop is they don't have a HDD activity LED.  I really like knowing the HDD is active when using a laptop - nope it's not there.  There are however, lights for the caps lock and numeric pad.  Why no HDD activity light ASUS?Windows 8 is really annoying - hopefully windows 10 will be better.  I put the program Start 8 on windows 8 to make it run like Windows 7.  It's at least tolerable now.A couple of other things to note:  Only 1 USB 3 port.  It would have been nice to have more but you can always buy a USB 3 hub.  Again, why can't they just make all ports USB 3?  They are backward compatible anyway.Built in camera only is VGA quality.  I don't Skype with my laptop, but if you do, you will be disappointed in the camera quality.In summary, this laptop is a mixed bag:Pros:Fast, Energy efficient Intel processor I5 processorDecent built in GPU with new Intel 5500 chipGreat versatility of having a touch screen with Windows 8/10 - helps with the navigation with a very bad touch padHigh resolution display, but lacks brightness and contrast - to much glare on  a glossy screenNo problem with the current Atheros WIFI adapter as others have commented on before - latest drivers installedYou can at least get to the HDD without tearing apart the entire computer like other models.Fairly light and thin form factorMetal backing for the back of the display and keyboard frame - however, creates finger prints like crazyVery little bloatware except for ASUS registration and McAfee Antivirus, which is easy to removeCons:Crippling slow hard disk drive - plan on replacing with an SSDNo internal DVD driveCan't easily upgrade memory due to large shield over the removable memory - however 8GB's should be enough for most peopleBad touch pad - not responsive and left/right buttons too hard to pressScreen is very dim and lacks contrast and punchNo back-lit keyboard - BIG ISSUE IN MY BOOKOnly 1 USB 3 portNo WIFI AC modeNo HDD activity lightTerrible VGA built in cameraChiclet keyboard is fair at bestSound is fair at bestNo user replaceable batteryDocumentation is installed on your hard driveConvoluted partition setup and difficult restore proceduresQuality control is lacking with loose parts inside my new machineASUS service is known to be terribleI'll update this review after I have had more time to use the laptop.  I'd rate it just fair for now.  The notebook was priced OK, but previous models were better for the same price.  I don't like where manufacturers are going with the new laptops today.  They are after higher margins at the expense of quality and the consumer, who usually doesn't know better is going to get the short end of the stick.ASUS is not the only manufacturer doing this, however, according to a recent laptop manufacture review, ASUS has slipped to near last for quality control and service.  They get high ratings on design, but be prepared for a lot of compromises.Update July 30, 2015:I just upgraded to Windows 10 without much of a problem.  Be aware that if you do this you will have to download the new track pad gesture software for Windows 10 from the ASUS website.  Other than that, no issues and Windows 10 is a very nice upgrade over Windows 8.1.  Windows 10 has some really nice features for 2 in one laptop like this to use as a tablet.  I haven't explored all of the functions yet, but plan to in the near future.I found there are adjustments for the monitor {Gama, etc.) in the Intel GPU software - but it's buried)  I wasn't able to make the monitor much better, but I am getting more used to it now.  I think there is some adjustment going from a 720P screen to a 1080P.ASUS says you can't upgrade the HDD to an SSD - YES YOU CAN ASUS!!!!  I just did it and it works like a new computer now.  In fact, it is very easy to do.  Send me a PM if you need some assistance.  I didn't bother upgrading the RAM, but I believe you can upgrade to 12GB's if want as well.  You just need to remove the metal shield from the motherboard to get access to the memory slot.  I've also found that battery life is significantly better with a SSD drive installed.  My average boot times with the SSD are around 6-8 seconds.  I ran the Samsung performance benchmarks and this system exceeds all of them by a good margin.The things that bug me the most about this laptop is the lack of back lit keys and lack of sensitivity adjustment to the touch pad.  The touch pad works fine as long as you touch it very lightly.  Even so, I find I'm constantly launching something I didn't intend to.  The glare from the screen is also annoying.  I think the glossy finish this screen has makes the screen seem so washed out.  I use the machine a lot in a dark environment and find myself constantly turning the light on to see the keys.  The screen is very sharp, but being so glossy just makes it difficult to use in any kind of bright lighting condition.If you go into the Intel GPU software control panel you can adjust Gamma under the Color settings.  If you drop it down to .7 from the default of 1, it makes the screen much easier to read.Other than these issues, I'm starting to like the laptop the more I use it, but this is only contingent upon replacing the slow HDD with an SSD.  Otherwise, this is just a very average laptop and is only worthy of three stars.  If you replace the HDD with an SSD, I would rate this laptop as a solid 4 star rating.  The performance is amazing with an SSD installed and it's a crime to put a standard HDD with such a fast computer.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),ASUS,"ASUS Flip 2-in-1 TP500LA-AS53T Laptop (Windows 8, Intel Core i5-5200U 2.2 GHz, 15.6"" LED-lit Screen, Storage: 1 TB, RAM: 8 GB) Black/Silver",NA,5.0,"
  Bought this as a travel computer. Already had a desktop and a heavy (9 lb) laptop. As a result was looking for something that would run office, Photoshop, reasonable Python and R programming projects, and would flip for when I was reading my Kindle purchased content. After much thought, opted for the i5 rather than the i7. One article indicated the performance difference was about 10% and purchasing more memory would be recommended. As this came with 8 GB rather than the 4 GB with some other systems, this seem to be a reasonable compromise when compared against paying an additional $170 for the i7.Came with Windows 8.1 and upgraded the next day to WIndows 10 which I really liked. One word of caution. I actually upgraded all three  of my computers on the same day and the upgrades were all straightforward and smooth. However, I had used a mouse while performing the ASUS upgrade. Later when I disconnected it, the Touchpad had stopped working. Had one bad experience earlier with Tech Support, but this time around, the technician was great. Apparently, Windows 10 can disable some features. It was a ten minute fix. You may not have the same problem, but be aware if you do that it should be quickly resolved with tech support.Now to the critical part. Did the machine meet my expectations, particularly because I went with the i5 rather than the i7. I have been using all three machines in different capacities and the feel on the ASUS is comparable. By that I mean that I do not perceive any noticeable difference when running on the ASUS. So it passes my original objective of purchasing a travel computer. A couple of things to be aware of. The screen is directional so you have to move it back and forth to find its optimum viewing position. When you do, the screen is very sharp, The keyboard is flat and for some people that is an issue, but would say that it is typical of other laptop keyboards. It does come with multiple USB ports. It does not come with an optical drive, but again, it is something that I do not need for a travel computer as I can always connect an external drive if that was needed. The hard drive is divided half into apps and half into data. That is a nuisance, though Windows 10 is intended to make storage opaque to the user. It is possible if you need less storage and want more performance to upgrade to a solid state hard drive. Finally, the approximate 5 lbs is much less than my other 9 lbs. laptop but certainly more than my wife's 3 lb laptop.So, if your need is for a reasonable mobile computer, I have found this to a solid choice for the price. If you are looking for a cutting edge mobile computer, you can expect to pay for more. But as you can see, this computer met my expectations for how I intended to use it. I did have some frustrating startup issues, but they were quickly resolved. I have given this five stars as a travel computer, but if you are intending to use this to replace your main computer, the rating would drop. It comes with a reasonable set of features, but less than what I would want if this was to be my main computer. Overall, for the price, I found it a good value.

  I bought this for my wife to use as her new business computer. I wanted to try a low end gaming laptop so it would stay fast for what she uses it for. She does a lot of Word, Excel, record keeping, video meetings & video classes. So far it runs great!Update, after wife used for business (Microsoft Office & Internet) for 1 1/2 months the laptop screen randomly goes black a couple times a day with the fan getting loud and she has to do a hard restart. Everything is up to date, tried shutdown, recovery & Bios refresh Asus tech suggested. Now we have to ship it to Asus. She‚Äôll never buy another one.

  Ok so far. Only hours old. Issues. Came with Win10 S mode. Clearly says its home edition online. Amazon tech clueless. While they said its the wrong item you can go into the setting, scroll to ""about"" and activate Win10 and turn off S Mode. I did it and it flipped it to Win10 Home.

  The laptop ""activates"" its windows version, but there is no windows product key in the box or on the laptop. There is no Microsoft Windows sticker either. I had to speak with Microsoft to get it to activate, but the customer service rep agreed that it was strange. It should come with the product. This laptop probably doesn't come with a legal version of Windows 10.

  Great value laptop. Got the Ryzen 3 for longer battery life since this lovely gem won't be gaming. Great for parents and grandparents. Thin, light, well built and nice  and snappy. Space for upgrade too.Never had a problem with asus products except when I tried to flash the bios and bricked a laptop. Took the innards and slapped it into a great mini pc. Lesson learned, don't try to update the bios.

  A good overall laptop for office duties. Feels very light and responsive. Obviously not for gaming. Screen is little dark, but OK. Good touch pad and keyboard, very small power brick, USB-C, good speakers. I am surprised that it does not have SD card reader, only mini-SD slot. So if you have a digital camera that used SD card, be prepared to buy a little adapter. Not a big deal, but still, very unusual...

  Everything met my expectations.In my case, the wi-fi was 'a bit' slow due to the distance to the router and obstructions.  It didn't support the higher-bandwidth connection on my router.I would have hoped the USB-C port could have supported charging, but it was difficult finding a laptop in this price range that has a USB-C port (that I liked).I liked the keyboard layout and design.Overall, a good buy.

  Laptop seemed really nice for the price and SUPER light. Ours came without Windows loaded though, so we sent it back.

  Nice specs for the price, which is the main reason I bought it. The laptop is very lightweight and has a nice appearance. Runs basic programs at a decent speed, the installation setup is nice and convenient, not needed in my case but useful for beginners. Speakers are not a concern for me since I mostly use wireless headphones and earbuds anyways.There are only three downsides I can think of at the moment.1) The screen which takes a sandy, granite texture when viewed from certain angles. Even directly staring at the screen it doesn't provide the cleanest of appearance even when using a completely blank white screen. Will definitely be replacing the screen in the near future.2) Is the high pitch whining whistle noise when the fan turns on. It starts off at a low volume then increases into an annoying dog whistle, when watching a single youtube video at 720p. This is occurring even while I type this review a few hours after receiving this laptop and that's after having ublock origin blocking off most of the websites ads and annoying background scripts and I haven't even downloaded any programs or moved anything into the storage yet.3) The usb port. It's difficult to stick the usb stick in all three usb ports. Even using a delicate touch I'm afraid that it might damage the area with constant use.

  It is a very stylish laptop, but I guess I got unlucky somehow with the one I received because the trackpad would bug out, the keyboard would malfunction, it would sometimes start freezing up, and also, quite often the Wifi would die until I restarted it.I'll just chalk it up to bad luck. The hardware must have been accidentally damaged during the manufacturing process.

  I have had this laptop for about a week and all is good. It arrived several days earlier than expected. Startup and shut down is amazingly fast. It runs cooler than my prior laptops. It is very light and thin with the solid state drive and the thin bezels on the screen make the whole unit smaller. The keyboard works fine (unlike the Acer I originally bought which I returned). The keyboard is a little smaller than I am used to on 15"" laptops but I am adapting. The battery life is solid for the tasks I do. All in all, a nice laptop and I am happy with my purchase. So happy, I just ordered my wife one. Time will tell, but for now I say, nice job Asus.

  The performance of this computer is excellent. My only issues come with the design of the body. There are tiny support posts on the touch screen base. They dig into my legs and are very annoying! Also, the right lower side of the body has a sharp edge near the corner, unlike my other Asus, which has smooth corners. I find myself using the older, slower one, because it is more comfortable.

  Not even 4 months old and the either the video driver/card is not working.  Screen constantly ""fazing"" and unclear!  I can't get ahold of anyone to fix it/replace it.  My calls have gone unanswered and I'm stuck with an $800 computer that I can't is practically unusable!

  It was time to upgrade my  laptop and I chose this  Asus. Had the brand previously and I like it. What can you say? It's a fast bootup and my applications, including a couple of beasts, run flawlessly. Nice small bezel around the screen. It's not going to win any sex appeal contests but this is a solid machine. FIVE STARS

  In December to acquire 2 laptops for family use, I have confidence in the brand, however the problem that I see with these laptops is that the audio at 2 o'clock is not strong, it is not possible to hear, the audio is very low, case Contraio when placing headphones, there the volume is high.I compare it with another Asus that has Harman / kardon audio with those that have SonicMaster audio, but it has no comparison, the Sonic Master audio is very low.I have not achieved better the audio of these 2 laptops.Just for the audio I don't give it 5 stars since the laptops work well to date.

  Excellent chromebook that seems very durable and with a battery that lasts forever.  BE CAREFUL about what you are ordering though. The version that comes WITH A PEN has a smooth gorilla glass screen. The cheaper version without a pen only has a soft in-cell matte vinil screen.  If the display type means anything to you, make sure you order the one with the pen.

  ***UPDATE*** 10/2018WiFi no longer works reliably after only 9 months. Started turning itself on/off intermittently about 2 months ago but was still workable most of the time. The problem has been increasing in frequency and now happens almost once a day. This is a pretty useless machine without WiFi. I have tried contacting Asus but they were unable to help (N181004210) and it's too late to return to Amazon.After doing quite a bit of research I believe this is the best 11.6‚Äù Chromebook you can buy right now (12/17) for under $300.Most important to me was portability, battery life, and a good keyboard. I also wanted Android support and a touch screen.Compact, lightweight, feels rugged and well built, It‚Äôs the perfect size to throw in my book bag. The rubberized edges, metal hinges, and tough outer shell seem like they will withstand a fair amount of real world abuse. This doesn‚Äôt feel like a device I need to baby.Battery life is amazing, lasts longer than I need, at least 12 hours.Keyboard is full sized, keys feel solid not loosey goosey, keypress is deeper than other chiclet style keyboards I‚Äôve used. This is a comfortable keyboard! Supposedly water resistant but I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try it out yet.It comes with the Google Play store installed for Android apps, seems to work pretty well. Not sure how much use I will get from it, most of the stuff I do runs well in the Chrome browser. So far I‚Äôve found that the Evernote app has enough extra capabilities to make it worth running. The Netflix app lets you download shows to watch offline which you can‚Äôt do in the browser. Still exploring.I love the matte screen, no glare or fingerprints. Touch screen works well, I find myself using it more than I thought I would. Like with the Smart Lock feature, instead of typing in my Google password everytime I open the chromebook, I use the fingerprint reader on my phone to unlock over bluetooth and just touch my account picture on the chromebook‚Äôs screen.I like the USB-C charging with ports on either side. I‚Äôve been surprised how nice the trackpad is, gestures work well. Speakers are much louder than I expected. Haven‚Äôt experienced any stuttering or lag, I usually have quite a few tabs open and extensions going. 1080p Youtube, Amazon Video, Netflix work great.I‚Äôm having trouble thinking of any flaws, will update.

  BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT:  This is a solid machine!  I am VERY happy with this device, and I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a solid Chromebook.  It is fast, has a great screen, has an awesome keyboard, sports TWO full-sized USB ports and TWO USB-C ports, and my transition away from my bulky Laptop and my Andorid Tablet has been seamless.January 2018: This was my Christmas Present this year.  I'm a ""gadget"" guy who got asked by his wife to reduce the number of gadgets.  My hope is that this will replace my tablet, my kindle, and reduce my need for my laptop.  I can happily say that it seems to have done that - and more.  I've been an Android user ever since I was given a G-1 to test when I worked at T-Mobile, but this is my first Chromebook.  I am a Galaxy Note user who is convinced that the pen is not only a NOT a gimmick, but it is a VITAL component to ANY tablet.  There's just something about handwriting notes that once you get used to, you do NOT want to go back.  I've had many tablets over the years, including the ASUS T101, which was an Android tablet that docked to a keyboard... and sported a pen.  When the T101 finally died, I moved to several Galaxy tablets, the last of those being the Galaxy Tab ""A"" that had an S-Pen.  I settled on a Chromebook largely because I do a lot of document writing (I'm a graduate student at night), and I missed the tight integration with a keyboard I had with the T101.  I also wanted to have an S-Pen, and nearly purchased the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro, which sport an S-Pen.  I saw the ASUS C213A with a pen after looking at the ""users also looked at"" suggestion on Amazon, and found that this Chromebook compared quite favorably with those.  This seemed to be in between the Plus and the Pro, both in terms of price and performance, along with the ""hardened"" qualities, which is a plus because I tend to be a bit hard on tablets, phones, and devices.I'm very glad I went with the ASUS.  It has been a while since I've been truly pleased with a new device.  You might be asking, ""Then why only 4 stars?""  There are two reasons for that: The pen and the non-backlit keyboard.  The pen, while it works PERFECTLY,  feels cheap when you hold it.  It also does not have a built-in docking location for it, like my S-Pen has on my Note and on the Tab A.  The final nail was that the keyboard is not lit.  I might add the fifth star back later, but for now, I'll keep it at 4.Those perceived short-comings aside, this is a VERY solid device.  I have used this thing literally every day since it arrived, and used it a lot.  Its fast - NO Lag issues that I've noticed.  From fully powered down, it boots in less than a minute.  From ""sleep,"" it boots as fast as I can open the screen.  Apps start quickly, they seem to run well, and swapping between apps is quick and lag free.  New to Chromebooks, I've quickly become a fan of the Chromebook's UI.  It runs Chrome, obviously, and websites act as they would if I hit them from my Windows laptop - not the ""mobile"" versions.  Office 365 runs perfectly.  So does my school's management system (Blackboard).  I have had no issues at all with either site.  My bank's website, Amazon, Facebook, News/Sports sites... everything I've tried it on worked without a hitch.On top of that, it has run every Android App I've wanted to add from the Google Play store.  Some, (AguaMail, for instance), ask to restart when I put them in FullScreen mode, but they work just fine after restarting... and they remember to come up in full-screen mode the next time I start them (until you power down or do a full reboot, that is).  I'm not a gamer, but I have satisfactorily tested the Android App versions of  AquaMail, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneDrive, OneNote, RoboDefense (for my kids, of course), Kindle, Bible (from YouVersion), Faithlife Study App, Logos Bible App, and Hootsuite.  Since it worked so well, I've moved back to the web portals for my bank, school, news, sports, and other stuff that I do... it sucked my shortcuts over just like you would expect it to... even presents the same shortcut bar I get on my Windows Laptop.  Even the extensions I've added to my desktop Chrome have pulled across.I am a heavy OneDrive user - I have Office365 home for the extra drive space.  The Chromebook ""Files"" app had a driver for OneDrive, and it connects perfectly.  I also have a 128GB MicroSD Card for local storage.  I can copy files to/from OneDrive without any difficulty at all... and that allows me to work on them when I'm not online.  It was a concern when I was making the decision to purchase a Chromebook, and I'm happy to say that working offline doesn't seem any more inconvenient as it is when you're on a laptop.Skype works just like you'd think it would, and the camera works perfectly, also.One thing I'd REALLY like to bring up that folks might not think about.  The two full-sized USB ports are awesome.  My wireless mouse, that has a dongle to communicate with the mouse, worked instantly after I plugged it in.  Same for my USB headphones that have a mike built into them.  Save for my MS Natural Keyboard.The Screen is awesome.  The Aspect is a bit wider than tall when compared to what normally comes on a laptop, but you get used to it quickly enough.  The image is very sharp, and the text is crisp and clear, even when it is small.  It gets more than bright enough to work in a well-lighted room, and it gets dim enough to work well in very low light... I love the range.  The function keys that adjust it work as you would expect them to.The BATTERY IS INCREDIBLE.  The marketing materials say ""12 hours, depending on the type of usage"".  That usually means ""12 is a pipe-dream"", but in my case, I can get more than that...  I've included a picture that shows a 16-hour estimate!  I've seen it say ""86% - 13:40 left"" (meaning 13+ hours), after a couple of hours of use.  When I had 5% battery left, it still had an estimate of over an hour.  I use it mostly in low-light conditions, and have the screen brightness down, but I forgot my charger at work one weekend, and it made it through what i would consider ""normal"" use - watching video lectures for school, watching a show or two on Amazon Prime before bed (working through ""World War II"" series), along with checking email, facebook, and taking notes in group and at church... it managed to make it just fine... I still ad 3% left when I plugged it in.  An hour later, when I checked, it was fully charged.  I was recently at all-day conference, and used it like a writing tablet all day, and it lasted the day, ending with about 15% left.  That was after being on, taking notes all day, with the screen on the whole time.  I did a test where I streamed movies, listened to music, took notes, browsed the web and let the kids play RoboDefense on it for the day, turning the screen back on whenever I noticed it shutting off, and it still had power left over at the end of the day... I'm very happy with the the battery life!Charging with the supplied power supply is FAST.  Just under an hour from an almost-dead state is the longest it has ever taken - normally, I'm at full within about 20-30 minutes, tops.  I bought a USB-C cable from Wal-mart and plugged it into a normal, 2.1amp charger that my Note uses, and it said it was on a ""slow"" charger, and might not charge when it is on.  I turned it off, and it went from about 49% to full in about an hour and a half.  With the tablet on, the charge either holds steady, or slowly builds, depending on the brightness of the screen.The pen, while it feels cheap, works great, and has not given my any reason to be concerned, other than how it feels.  It feels light, hollow, and made of cheap plastic... but it works perfectly.  The pen is NOT a gimick, and it is NOT simply a foam-tipped ""Stylus"".  It is a legit pen along the lines of the Samsung S-Pen.  It uses a near-field radio-receiver to tell where it is, and the tip has a sensor that knows how hard you are pressing, modifying the signal to let the tablet know, just like the S-Pen does on Galaxy devices.  in fact, my s-Pen from my Galaxy Note 5 works perfectly, as does the pen from my Tab ""A"", as well as the one from my old Note 2.  I wish they'd have made their pen smaller, and provided a slot for it on the tablet, like the Galaxy devices have, but if I DO forget to bring my pen, I can simply pull the one off my Phone (Note 5), and use it, so its not all that bad.  Still, on my mind it is an oversight.The hinge works quite well.  It is smooth, and seems a bit too easy to move, but it holds the screen where you leave it, and it doesn't sag or anything, so it seems OK.  The screen does wag slightly when I type, but it doesn't move from where I left it.  Switching to tablet mode is easy , and the device transitions smoothly.  Flipping the keyboard around to watch a movie actually seems to make s difference for some reason, so that's pretty handy.  The keys turn off when they are ""down"" as does the glide-pad, and  the chromebook works as you would expect a tablet to work.  It IS a bit heavy to hold and take notes for an hour or so in a stretch... but I think I will get used to it.The sound seems to come from under the keyboard... at least it seems that way.  I'm not a sound guy - the Army ensured that I don't hear well enough to be too concerned with that.  I usually use headphones, but if the built-in speaker matters to you, then folks might want to take that in mind, because I noticed it doesn't sound as good at my phone or older tablets have  The headphones, of course, work just fine... and I'm sure a blue-tooth speaker would sound great also... but the build-in ones are a bit flat, even for me.I use the same blue-tooth mouse I use on my laptop.  I plugged my Logitech Trackball's USB dongle into the full-sized USB port, and it worked perfectly, without any delay.  That adds a LOT for me... I'm not a fan of glidepads, and I was VERY happy when my mouse just worked without a hitch.  On that, the glide-pad does not seem to be overly sensitive, but seems to work just as I'd expect it to.  As far as built-in glide-pads go, it seems to be one of the better ones I've used.I haven't tested the ""water resistant"" features... but its good to know they are there.All in all, this was a good get for me.  I have not logged into my windows laptop in more than a week, and have stopped bringing it with me.  I put my Galaxy Tab ""A"" up for sale, and have unregistered my old Kindle.  I now am down to my phone and my Chromebook.  It is keeping up with what I need it to do quite well.  I don't feel that I've had to sacrifice when moving from my Laptop to this thing. I'm working on a 20-24 page paper, and I'm having no problems at all working on it so far.  I've already turned one in that I started on my laptop, and finished on the Chromebook... it is working as well as I need it to - even better.PROS:Sturdy, well built, a very solid device.Quick!  No lag issues at all, switches between apps smoothly and efficiently.The Battery is AWESOMEFANTASTIC KEYBOARD - the feedback, press weight, movement... its perfect.GREAT Screen - bright, crisp, sharp, with lots of real estate.  Great color and a very consistent tone.The pen works as well as they do on the Galaxy devicesMy phone's pen (Galaxy Note) works with this Chromebook2 FULL SIZED USB ports AND 2 USB-C portsCompatible with my USB external keyboard (Microsoft Natural) and mouse (logitech trackball with blue-tooth 'dongle'), USB drives, and even my USB speaker/mic headphones.CONS:A bit hefty to take notes on for a long time in ""writing tablet mode""Pen feels cheap (but it works well)Keyboard is not back-litI can't put a cover on it, unless I do NOT want to use it in ""tablet mode"".

  I'm not too picky about my laptops as I have a main desktop I use for everything. I was a little skeptical about this laptop because there are only six reviews. I have had it for less than 24 hours but but everything seems great so far. Screen is nice, fingerprint scanner is fast and the laptop is nearly as fast as my desktop. This is mainly a school and travel laptop so no gaming or extreme work will be done on it.Right now everything seems good but I will update if anything comes up.

  This backlit keyboard laptop is the best I've had. But it's only been 2 days. Keyboard and mouse pad are the best I've used. Reaction time, the best, so far. Boot up time, the best, so far.Update: Best keyboard and touchpad I have ever used. Fastest start up I've ever used. Hmm...strong buy again.Update II: It's been a couple weeks now. Best laptop I've ever purchased. Better than Apple and a Dell. Start up is 3 seconds instead of minutes for Dell. Wireless connectivity every time (unlike Dell). Zero issues. I give this a solid recommend and would buy again. Well done Asus.

  I've had my new computer a little over a week now and use it daily. When online and then click off to go to a file on my computer and return to the online page, the online page is black and there is nothing you can do but open a new browser. The same thing happens when I'm in documents, like say an excel file. I click off the file to look at something else and when I return the page is blank but the file is still open (picture attached). Aside from that is works like a normal computer, but with the blank screens on desktop files and when browsing online, it waste time to close and reopen files and I shouldn't be having the issue. There are also mouse issues. It freezes all the time.

  THE GOOD:- Nice specs for the price- Lightweight but seems solidly built- No power brick just a small adapter not much bigger than a phone charger- 1080p display is bright and crisp and looks great when streaming HD content- On-board video plays older games well- Decent amount and variety of ports- Great wireless receiver (easily hits the limit of our 300Mbps fiber internet)- Speakers produce clear sound at a good volume- Looks quite stylishTHE BAD:- Some backlight leak at the top of the screen in 2-3 places. Only noticeable when watching content with black bars top and bottom, but a little annoying.- Keyboard feels a cheap- Comes with some ASUS bloatware installed (can be uninstalled without difficulty)CONCLUSION:This is a solid general purpose laptop. The HD 17"" display and solid wi-fi performance are great for streaming. It has more than enough power for web browsing and Office apps, but will obviously not be able to play the latest demanding games. The backlight leak and cheap keyboard let it down a little, but it is still a nice laptop for the price.

  Very easy to get going. Was up and running in about 30 minutes. It is a light crisp device. It has a vibrant display.Two comments:First the lettering on the keyboard is very hard to see.

  I have only used this for a couple of weeks but it worked great out of the box and so far no issues. It is very light weight. The battery life is adequate for my use.

  What I needed was a powerful laptop capable of recording audio with no latency, & at home work capabilities.So I upgraded to 12gb RAM. That has this machine running many programs at once at optimal capacity, the audio latency is not an issue, & is filling all of my needs. The trackpad is so easy to use & fingerprint sensor works perfectly!That said, the screen is not optimal for watching videos. Its one of those thats hard to see from any angle except directly in front of the screen. The speakers arent that great, but I didnt expect them to be. Battery life is not great, but not an issue in my case as Ill keep mine home.Another slight con to mention is the processor. I got an i3 10tg gen. Would be great if it came with the i5 to compensate for the poor quality screen & short battrry life. Those are my only cons so far for this 2020 Asus Vivobook.  For a little over $600, I think this laptop is great purchase for work, school, or content creation. I did extensive research before making this purchase and so far happy with my Asus Vivobook. Seller is super quick to ship. Mine areived before expected delivery date.

  I bought and Asus computer after I spilled water on my Dell laptop. I knew nothing of Asus, but after using the laptop for 2+ yrs I was impressed enough to buy the VivoBook. It's heads and shoulders above my first Asus. Much lighter, great keyboard, significantly faster and nice looking. Can't believe how sleek and light it is. Screen is great. Good for watching Hulu, Netflix...etc. Speakers are ok. Sound low depending on what you're watching. Not much better than my first Asus. Otherwise, wonderful computer at a reasonable price. Nice upgrades in backlit keyboard lights and finger print scanner. I highly recommend the VivoBook 15. Very happy that I stayed in the Asus family.

  (Edited again ) After 3 month of use this are my impressions. So far its soo good so impressed with this product even after 3 months use. My model is with Amd ryzen 4700u.Body : Laptop is made of aluminum and its very sturdy i will say its really really good for the price. I wish it had more colors as this black is matte and its a fingerprint magnet. And the 360¬∞ hinge also very good one.Port : The port selection is good 2 normal USB(usb 2.0 and usb 3.2 gen 2), HDMI port, 1 usb Type-C, headphone jack, Kingston lock and charging port. I wish the Usb Type - C supported charging (it doesn't support charging and display port just for data transfer).Display : Its good for most users and for my use its really good. It covers 60% SRGB ( if your photo or video editor who need 100% SRGB then go for others). The panel itself is good and have decent brightness level for my use i usually keep at 35% . And its touch screen and the touch response is soo good.Performance : My model comes with Amd 4700U and the performance is very fast. Its soo good whatever you are doing it can handle very well. And the fan noise silent for normal use and if you doing heavy task the fan noise increases but it's under control . [(update) Also if u are doing light stuffs like reading a pdf or doing some light stuff the fan completely turns off. So its super silent for light users.] There is performance fan mode in MyAsus App which increases fan speed and noise for performance mode. For gaming i don't know i actually didn't use for gaming but it can handle some gaming i guess atleast from internet i saw it has a Nvidia Mx 150 like performance.Ram : 8 GB Ram comes on board and the surprising thing is one slot is expandable. Out of the box it comes with 4GB sorted + 4GB in expandable sort. It can be upgraded upto 16 GB Ram so it can handle total of 20 GB. And this itself makes one of the best reason to go for it.Storage : 512 GB SSD its fast and even that is upgradable.Battery : (update) Now after driver updates and windows update My laptop goes 7-8 hrs normally and if using light stuffs it can go all the way upto 12-14 hrs. Thats a massive change after updates. So now u don't have to worry about charging. And the charger is very compact 45 W charger its small and it can fit in any bag.Wifi card : My model comes with intel wifi 5 and its good. And if you want that's also upgradable. This laptop has so many user replaceable parts that make it best for customers even if you don't need to upgrade it can be useful for future needs.Track pad : Its decent the tracking is very good but the button are not that great atleast for my taste.Keyboard : The keyboard is good one with backlight. And it has very decent travel and i like the shortcut keys in function keys and you can change it when you want to use function keys(eg: f1) by just pressing FN +esc and it shows a small led color when its in Function button mode in FN button . The only thing i would say bad is that the ""back space key"" is little smaller than normal laptop.Camera and Mic : Not good not bad its just a typical laptop camera but the mics are surprisingly good one.Speakers : The speakers are good. Just goto Audio wizard app and change it into Movies it literally makes the speakers very good.Pen : I am not a professional but from my usage for normal note taking usage it was good one. And it comes in box.Security : It has fingerprint sensor and it so fast and it also supports windows hello.Conclusion : (updated) This laptop is Excellent for the price of $699 for Amd ryzen 4700u. It balances out every thing for the price. And the value for money is 10/10. The only Downside is the stock of the product it just finishes so quickly. Otherwise this should be one of the popular laptops. For those who trying to buy this laptop. My advice is constantly check the product page because it sometimes suddenly comes to stock.

  Greatest value laptop (if you can catch it in stock). The RAM is relatively easily upgradeable to 20GB. See the images attached for those of you who were curious of the internals like I was. Hopefully I didn't void my warranty..So we have a Ryzen 7 4700U, with 20GB RAM, 512GB Samsung NVMe, 2 in 1 (with pen) and a backlit keyboard. With a base cost of $699 + $57 for RAM, this is unbelievable value and outclasses the non upgradeable Lenovos and Acers.Everything will function to your expectations. My only complaint is that the screen seems dim in bright light/outdoors but this is forgivable since the 250nit spec was stated upfront. Please adjust your colour settings via the Radeon app, as at first the colours will appear washed out.Will get another if it's ever in stock again.

  Most of you are on Windows. If you are, you can pretend that this review has 5 stars because everything works fine on Windows, and Microsoft did a very good job with their touch UI. Hell, I'm even thinking of just giving it 5 stars.The AMD Ryzen in there, along with its integrated graphics, is very fast. It beats my (old, but still kinda beefy) gaming pc in frames per second on Minecraft. Battery lasts forever. It's also very quiet. Under light loads, the fans don't spin at all, and when you start doing heavy stuff, they still spin quietly, and the whole thing stays cool.When AMD dropped these processors this year, they made a statement that says nobody should have to pay extra to get a machine that doesn't suck.I got used to the keyboard and touchscreen very quickly. I don't have like a million laptops to compare to, but I can say the keyboard is nice and comfortable. Build quality is metal so this will last you a long time.And upgradable memory is really something you want. 8 GB might not be much in a couple years, but if you start running out, you can replace one of the 4GB sticks with a 16, giving you a very nice 20GB of ram. Many companies are moving towards soldered ram, which is sad.So if you're running Windows, and want a 2 in 1 that runs quickly, this is the machine for you. You can stop reading the review here.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But if you run Linux, and want something that you don't have to fiddle with to keep running without having to make sacrifices, you should look somewhere else. I hear good things about Lenovo, so you might have better luck over there.I don't like Windows out of personal preference. I'm a developer, and while Linux Subsystem for Windows is getting better, it's nowhere near as good as running the real thing. I'm also a little paranoid when it comes to my privacy. I'm not gonna run an operating system that mines my data, and I wont take any of that ""nothing to hide, nothing to fear"" crap. I might as well go for a walk with no mask and no pants. There is nothing wrong with having something to hide. Valve's proton is getting better and better, and almost all my games run faster on Linux, so I game on Linux too.Now, I knew what I was getting into. Linux touch UI is not the best. I'm running Ubuntu 20.10 (sorry its not arch). Some apps play nicely, mostly Gtk apps and Blink based browsers (Chromium, Chrome, and the one I use, Brave). But it's nowhere near as good as touch support on Windows. But, that's why I got this. I'm hoping to make touch support better on Linux, and I can't really do that if I don't have a touchscreen Linux machine.Some other things also don't work out of the box. Some function keys don't work. Only volume, brightness, touchpad, keyboard backlight, and lock screen do. When you flip the screen over and use it like a tablet, the keyboard stays on, so you'll probably bump keys. The screen doesn't rotate like it does on Windows. I've seen some fixes going around but I haven't had the chance to install them so I can't tell you how well they work. They probably work well though.Fingerprint only kinda works. On Windows, you can just tap and you're fine. On Linux, libfprint can't get a high enough resolution image, so you have to carefully swipe your finger over the reader. It works, but it takes a few tries to get right, so you're probably gonna be faster just typing your password.But what really caught me off guard was that when you sleep it, the kernel hangs about 80% of the time when you wake it up. It doesn't stop the fans when you do sleep it either, so it will keep burning battery. You're better off setting it to keep running when you close the lid like I have, and shutting down if you wont use it for a while, which is fine because even with dm-crypt full disk encryption, it still boots very fast.Turns out ASUS used some weird UEFI implementation that breaks away from the standards. Only Microsoft's kernel works with it. There's no documentation for where it breaks the standards, nor is there source code or even closed source binaries for it. It's all up to reverse engineering projects, which I will probably join as soon as I get the chance.Everything else works great. AMD's graphics drivers run great on Linux, and if you choose the community driven open source alternative, those work good too. Wireless is more stable than my old laptop (Dell Latitude E6330).------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Before I end this review, I just want to say that ASUS does not support Linux, and they don't have to. Most people run Windows. ASUS wants to focus on making the more popular operating system run as good as possible. We made the choice to run something else. Even if their choice was for money, there's nothing wrong with that because they have families to feed.We should not be toxic with them for making this choice. I see a lot of yall getting toxic with companies who don't support Linux. ASUS will probably change their mind if there were a lot more of us, but if the Linux community is known to be just a bunch of toxic nerds who throw a fit if some innocent company refuses to spend millions of dollars paying engineers and licensing code just to please like 19 people, we will never grow. If we don't like it, we need to either fix things ourselves or go somewhere else.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------edit: with ubuntu out of the box i later realized audio had a noticable delay. if you have the same problem, ill lay out some steps for those with little to no terminal experience1. open a terminal2. run the command `gedit admin:///etc/pulse/daemon.conf` without ` and type your password when it asks4. go to the bottom of the file and add two new lines, `default-fragments = 5` and `default-fragment-size-msec = 2`5. save and close the text editor6. either go back to the terminal and run the command `pulseaudio -k`, or just reboot your computerthis is from https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Laggy_soundill be back with more fixes as i find them.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------edit: 21.04 update just came out, which switches the default compositor from x11 to wayland. i was excited to move to wayland with its promises of better performance and security, but i got worse performance from it. i tried launching half life 2, and it locked up my whole display. game made sounds and everything but i couldnt even drop into a tty. so make sure at the login screen you click that gear icon and select ""ubuntu on x.org""the login screen will still run on wayland, meaning you have both x11 and wayland running at the same time, which means nothing for speed once youre in x11 as far as i know, but it will slow down boot time a little bit and hold a little bit of extra ram. if you wanna get some of this ram back, you can edit the file /etc/gdm3/custom.conf1. open a terminal, this time type `gedit admin:///etc/gdm3/custom.conf`2. fine the line where it says ""# Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg""3. uncomment the line below it by removing the #4. save and close iton your next reboot, x11 should be all that runs. if you want you can uninstall wayland, but it shouldnt really take up too much space and i dont know how a system upgrade would react to that.wayland will get better in the future though, its just not ready for this machine rn.sleep is still broken sadly. a little bit more reliable but not for daily use.

  This product seemed like a bargain...(Ryzen 5 3500U, 8gb model)SUMMARY (2400mhz RAM only runs @800mhz off the charger AT ALL TIMES) (ONLY 1 RAM SLOT)DEEMED: DECEIVINGFirst things first...THE RAMAdvertised at 2400mhz: with descriptions, reviews, and answers that are misleading.  First thing to know: upon contacting ASUS, there are two possible motherboard configurations: one with 4gb of soldered RAM paired with a 4gb SODIMM, and a configuration with NO onboard RAM, and one 8gb SODIMM.  I bought an extra RAM stick hoping to boost up to 12 GB only to find out I had the MB configuration NOBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT.So you can imagine, as I‚Äôm about to add this sweet 8gb stick: there‚Äôs already just a single 8gb stick in the slot making the upgrade redundant.Next, I decided to install CPU-Z to see what the hold-up was.  I noticed the laptop was a bit slower than I expected for the specs when it wasn‚Äôt on the charger, and let‚Äôs be forward here the only reason anyone BUYS a laptop is to use in portable situations hence the expectation of full performance away from the plug.  Anyway, upon installing CPU-Z I noticed a few things off about the RAM.  First off, it ran at a native 1866mhz when plugged in UNTIL you do something that requires an extra push, at which time the RAM ramps up to the advertised 2400mhz.  Secondly, I checked with the cord unplugged to find out the RAM was running at an APPALLING 800mhz.  The ASUS spokesperson said that it was an expected feature and not a defect.What makes things worse: I know how RAM modules work.  A single SODIMM draws such a small amount of power, that revving it down to a speed equivalent to that of a mid-tier DDR2 module is unacceptable!  Just another factory implementation of a throttling method to force people who get their PC for a bargain to regret making the right decision.To make matters EVEN WORSE: this model comes equipped with a Ryzen 5 CPU.  *What‚Äôs wrong with that?*  What‚Äôs wrong with that is this: Ryzen CPU‚Äôs by design, are relatively dependent on the onboard RAM.  MEANING: Slower RAM = Worse CPU performance.So, RAM that performs at 1/3 of the advertised speed, (2400mhz is just OKAY for RAM in the first place) a single RAM slot with no option for dual channel, and a CPU that WILL perform slower as a result make this PC perform at the $150-$200 range when away from the charger.BUY SOMETHING ELSE FROM ANOTHER BRANDThe one plus= The nice screen-to-body ratio.

  Honestly, the laptop is great! I did buy a 1x8GB kit of ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz cl16 ram to upgrade the memory on the laptop from the original 8GB, and I made a quick discovery that the laptop comes with 4GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard, thus you can only replace the other stick of RAM in the populated RAM slot that has a 4GB stick in it. So I now have 12GB of RAM on my f512d ryzen model. Furthermore, the SSD that came included with my model used a Kingston 256GB SSD, leaving one open slot for a 2.5 inch Sata SSD or HDD. The battery life lasts about 2-3 hours on a near-full charge, and since my college classes require atleast a 1.5 hours of charge per class, I could dim down the display for less battery usage and possibly the keyboard backlights, but I'd say it's a win either way. Overall, the screen is IPS and beautiful, the entire system  feels snappy and responsive, and I can actually run 3D applications on it without it bugging out like my last Samsung i3 laptop from 2013. Love AMD's new product lineup and I hope this helps anyone else looking to buy this laptop.UPDATE:Sadly, my unit didn't last long. I just began using my 3-d softwares and new code IDE's for C++ and this thing blue-screened every 5 minutes or so. Sometimes I was lucky and it'd work nicely but just today, the drive slowed down to a near halt and as windows tried to repair or reset it, it just died. I now boot into the bios everytime with no storage or boot-detection of the ssd. What a brilliant time for it to die. Also for battery life, turning off the keyboard backlighting litterally gave me 9+ hours of battery-life. Sad to see it go.UPDATE #2:Please check comments to this review for more. With all due respect, I won't be updating anything in this review or responding to any of the comments published beyond this date. I hope I was able to help anyone with their purchase.

  Good computer for the money. However l sent an email to ASUS asking about maximum upgrade for ram and if there was a spot for an added hard drive. I was told it could be upgraded to 12GB and there is a slot to install an additional 4GB. If l wanted a larger hard drive l would have to replace the one currently installed. As you can see by the photos there is no slot to add RAM but there is a space for an additional hard drive. Even looking up the specs yourself online you are given incorrect information. I had it delivered to the Philippines and am not going to pay to send it back. It is a good computer for the price, my real issue was with ASUS not even being able to provide accurate information to upgrade. Something tells me it can probably be upgraded to 16 but have to replace the currently installed RAM.

  Bought this laptop today and the seller shipped the same day. Which was really cool, usually sellers take 1 or 2 days to ship. I‚Äôll be updating the review once the laptop arrives.Update: Laptop arrived a day early and it came with 20GB of Ram, 512GB SSD, but it did not come with a backlight keyboard.

  This laptop is not getting anywhere near enough visibility. Honestly, unless you spend well over $1,200 I cannot find a better deal. The display is stunning with it's nearly 100% SRGB color space, the NVME SSD is blazing fast, the keyboard is crisp and a pleasure to type on, the track pad is incredibly accurate, it's extremely light, the battery life is incredible.I could go on, but seriously, this laptop is an amazing machine, especially at this price point!10/10 would buy again!

  Good screen and fast enough for my daily study use.However, the keyboard should be blamed because it is not only unclear to read but also lost control several times after sleeping.

  I bought this laptop 1 month ago and I think this is the best device in this range.It is very fast owing to the high speed CPU. screen quality is very good.for gaming, I run CSGO in low options while plugin.the worse thing is the keyboard's fonts and backlight. Words are not easily seen.

  This is not 1920x1080, it's a widescreen aspect ratio so this is actually a very small laptop. This is basically the size of a netbook, not a 14"" laptop. If that's what you want I'm sure this will work great but I am returning this.

  I'm a heavy computer user. I write, teach online, play video games, etc... I needed a new laptop that could handle the daily work. This model came with good reviews, but has been upgraded from the base specs.  The laptop shipped fast, was packaged very well, and was exactly what I was looking for. I'm really enjoying using it! It's lightweight which is nice for when I get to go out into the world again and work from coffee shops LOL. It runs very quick and smooth. It runs any game or program I've thrown at it with little to no trouble. Even though I tend to keep a lot of tabs open and programs running at one time it doesn't seem to get bogged down like my old laptop. The speakers are better than any laptop I've had, really nice sound, and the mic and camera are very functional for zoom and google meet events and classes.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

  I started working from home this year due to COVID and my old computer was very slow and making it difficult. I didn‚Äôt want to spend too much on a new computer because I‚Äôm not sure how long I‚Äôll be working from home so I searched for a good laptop at a decent price. This laptop has proven to be a great value. It‚Äôs slim, light weight, ergonomically comfortable, and so much faster than I expected. I haven‚Äôt used this laptop for gaming but my gamer boyfriend was impressed by the specs so I assume it‚Äôll be good if I ever get around to using it for games.

  I tried 2 14 inch Asus laptops before settling with this one.  I liked them but they both had issues with functions.  This one has had no problems, seems much better in terms of reliability and speed.  It doesn't get hot, is fairly quick on start up, and the touch screen is perfect.  It does have the DVD drive, which I didn't necessarily need, but it does come in handy.  For one hundred dollars more, this laptop has a look and feel of a much more expensive computer.  The keyboard is Apple style.  The only thing I miss is a back lit keyboard.  Other than that, I would say this is just about perfect.

  I'm using this laptop right now and have been happy with the performance.I would have given it a higher rating if I hadn't had to return it to be repaired. After about 2 months the screen started to have black spots and after a few chat sessions with tech support they requested that I send it back. I was on the hook for the $30 to ship it back so that was a bummer. They fixed the screen in one day and had it back to me in 4 days.Most of my work is spreadsheet and document oriented so I don't need a lot of computing power so I can't attest to its speed and power. If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have opted for the touchscreen. I never use it and I have to believe that this extra option might make the screen more repair prone in the future.

  I've been scoping and pricing laptops for my mom for several months when I found - and bought - this Asus V551LA-DH51T.  This laptop is nearly perfect.  One complaint:  it's not backlit.  That's a minor quibble but I was a little disheartened by it.  That also explains the 4-star rating.  Otherwise, this computer is the perfect gift for those who aren't technically savvy but still pay their bills, send emails and read the New York Times on their computers.  This computer is the perfect gem for basic everyday use.  And the price was unbeatable.  Plus free shipping.  Win, Win, Win!

  Nice appearance and seems durable.  Touch screen is responsive and sensitivity is good.  Everything seemed okay except for ability to maintain an internet connection.  On both private and public systems, connection would inexplicably drop and then reconnect.  Updated drivers and had friend who is a PC Tech make numerous changes.  This improved but did not resolve the problem.  Also, the max volume is rather low.  It is okay for general use but if you plan to stream videos you may find it inadequate.  I have been told that there is an issue with Windows 8 and drivers but seems Asus should address this before selling these.  After purchase, I found a number of other Asus owners who indicated the same issue.  Returned it.  Very pleased with Amazon on the return.  Painless.

  I've run into several of the same issues described in other reviews here. The wireless connection drops often, it freezes up and goes to sleep on its own while I'm working on it, and sometimes it does not recognize that a USB drive is plugged into it. I've also found that the wireless problem is exponentially worse when the laptop is not plugged in. Weird I know, but as a result I now keep it plugged in nearly all the time.I would have returned it if I'd bought it direct from Amazon but I purchased from an Amazon subvendor on the East Coast due to high Xmas demand and it's proven to be a hassle that I'd rather not deal with. Should have been patient and just waited till Amazon had it in stock... lesson learned.

  CONS:The charger is bulky and mine already has a crack in it. It is difficult to find a replacement for.  But it is light weight, fast, and has only crashed once on me. When I first got it, it updated itself about 2-3 times a week, but now (a few months later) it is running fine.The CD/DVD port takes a while to read your disks, and sometimes it doesn't read them at all, but that is no big deal for me since I rarely uses disks..The screen doesn't get as bright as I would like it to, especially during late night studying.The mouse pad becomes useless if you use the touch screen feature for too long. If you use the touch screen feature, you will not be able to use the mouse unless you exit the program and restart ( and even then it is not a guarantee)All in all, this was a steal for less than $600

  There are some good pros to this product and there are also some cons. No computer is perfect.The computer is very fast, with quick start up time, and the internet is very quick. Battery life is really good. Its lasts about 5 hours. The key bored does have some sensitivity issues like other reviews stated during my research of this computer. The space bar has to be hit directly in the middle or it does not register and sometimes it takes more force than my last computer. I have gotten used to this but I do have to go back and put in spaces when writing notes in class. The Period key also pops up when you hit the right side of it but pushes back down without any problems.Windows 8 takes some getting used to, overall I have loaded everything to the desk top so I don't have to use the apps as much and that makes it very similar to using a Windows 7 computer, and more like what I was used to.I have had no trouble with the touch screen but have not had the computer long so I cannot say anything about the longevity of the mechanisms.

  It's a good value because of the price, but in the end it's a relatively cheap laptop. You kind of get what you pay for, so I am rating the product itself rather than the value. There are little annoying things, like the video quality isn't close to HD (my phone displays a much cleaner picture) and the keys a just a smidge too far apart for someone who is used to more a conventional keyboard. It is also kind of heavy. But it's good for what it is, just a cheap, around the house laptop for web browsing, document editing, etc.

  So far it's a decent laptop. The reason I am giving it only three stars is because the specs provided on Amazon say it has ""1 x USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 (support data transfer, Power Delivery and DisplayPort)."" However, the USB C is the ""SS"" type of USB C which means it does NOT support DisplayPort. That was one of the main reasons I selected this computer, so I was disappointed it could not do this.

  My third grade great-grandson was enrolled last minute in e-learning at home because of the pandemic.  He needed a laptop quickly, however quality student ones were sold out locally.

  This laptop has exceeded my expectations, the model that I got has the 228gb ssd, 1tb HDD, 12 gigs of ram, AMD ryzen 5 processor, and AMD Radeon Vega graphics. The only issue I had when getting it was that the settings have to be changed so all your downloads, files music....etc are saved to the HDD. So if you have more than one hard drive on the computer it‚Äôs best to just leave the ssd with your os. And save all your files to the HDD. Other than that for the price and power well worth the buy for a multipurpose college and gaming laptop. Also it doesn‚Äôt have a touchscreen but that‚Äôs not an issue for me.

  I am a teacher, and I need to use many add-on tools (such as XP-Pen graphic tablet) to teach from home during this pandemic time.  This laptop would give me black-out screen when I was browsing the internet, and then a completely frozen screen when I was using the graphic tablet during a class session.  When the frozen screen happened, I had to force the laptop to turn off and turn back on to continue the teaching.  It is definitely not ideal.  I returned the first laptop and bought the exact same model again thinking the first one might just happen to be a defected item.  Unfortunately the second one was just the same -- same problems happened on the first time I used it.  I will return the second one and do not recommend this laptop.

  I'm disappointed. I had an ASUS years ago, but it had issues. I replaced it with an HP four years ago, but needed another new laptop for this school year (I teach high school online). Because of cost, I went with ASUS again, and now remember why I didn't like them: when the laptop updates every other week or so, the sound drivers no longer work. That's annoying when you're a teacher and have to quickly troubleshoot and restart your laptop before class begins. I've also experienced the BSD three times when disconnecting an HDMI cord connecting the laptop to a TV. These are basic issues which should no longer be issues with a laptop like this. In the past my ASUS overheated with videos. So far, so good, but I've never shown anything longer than 5 minutes. I'm worried for when I show 30 minute videos. Hopefully that issue is resolved, though. Next time, I'm going back to HP.

  I use this mostly for schoolwork and slightly older/simpler games. Dragon Age Origins, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, Stardew Valley, Team Fortress 2, etc. They run just fine without lagging.VIDEOS: It works perfectly fine for me, but just before a video plays the screen will go black for just a second. So far it's always come back on immediately, but it is disorienting.COLOR: Another thing the color is very grayed out. It's like a perpetual night mode, even though night mode is off. If you're looking for a computer for a drawing tablet/clear or vibrant colors, this won't work for you.BATTERY: The battery can also run a little fast, but you can still get a few (3-4) solid hours of using it at full brightness, depending on what you're doing.

  First I will say like others have said it does come with 20 gb ram  in it. The price isn't to bad and the overall experience of use was alright, but I expected with so much ram that I wouldn't have much issue but I did. I am horrible at closing tabs I will find something and want to check it out later and leave the tab up. A few days of this and I get 10+ tabs up. That is where the issue happens it can not run great with a lot of tabs open. I have a gaming laptop I bought in 2013 that runs way better then it with this. I still would have given the laptop a higher rating but because I wasn't happy with the fact that it couldn't handle one of my main issues I returned it. The problem was they charged me around $100 restocking fee. I think it came out to exactly 20%. I wasn't told there would be a restocking fee and when I called up amazon to find out if I missed something they agreed and sent the company a message. A short bit later I got an email from them saying they were allowed to charge me that, so I called amazon again and asked what was going on. They still agreed with me that I shouldn't have been charged the fee and are trying to deal with it.  I almost never do reviews but I felt after this experience if you are on the fence this might help.  I am not saying it is a terrible product but I won't buy from the seller again after my experience. If they had been up front about the restocking fee it would have been a bit different but $100 for a $470 laptop( when I bought it that is what it was) is way to much imoTLDR: the laptop isn't bad for the price but I don't trust the seller anymore so that is why my ratings is so low. If you don't do a lot of stuff on it the laptop isn't bad but if you keep a lot of tabs up like me I would look for something else.Edit: I just got a message back from the company which said to look at amazons return policy and a link to it and I clicked it but it said they could only take 20% if it took more then 30 days to return and I returned it in less then 20 days, so now I  changed the rating froma 2 to a 1 because they are so incompetent that they sent me proof that they cheated me out of $100

  Despite what the other guy said, my computer came in and the first thing I  checked to see was if the specs matched. I ordered one with 16gbb of ram. I got one that has 20gbb of ram with 18 of it being usable. So this passed my expectations! For ssd, mine says 238 as well but you have to remember the computer itself needs to use some of that space for the operating system, and other preinstalled things. So although it says 256, only 238 is available to you to use. But for the price this is still really good!! Its fast, the screen is decent. The keyboard is spaced out nicely as well. The mouse pad is very responsive and doesnt feel flimsy. The overall build feels good. If I have any issues I'll update this

  Overall satisfied, had this as a replacement for an old Dell Latitude, which, compared to this, was a battle tank. It came with more RAM than advertised, 20Gb actually, which is a huge plus. I use it for Kubuntu Linux and for the first time I've had issued running a distro after install -- had to revert to a previous kernel to make it boot. With the right kernel, it works like a charm. The screen is OK at night or with low lights, but during the day I find myself adjusting its tilt to make it more visible. The keys feel a bit loose, but they're comfortable enough. The trackpad is huge although I'm more of a mouse person. Overall, this is a nice machine for the price. Good price-value ratio. I'm treating it right to make it last. I still haven't tried its graphics, but will soon. Will possible update this review. An SSD upgrade is also in the plans.

  I recommend people stay away from older laptops with this kind of pricing at least rn. Newer laptops with the new ryzen cpus are coming out with prices really close sometimes lower than this latop. I wish i could have waited a bit more but this was for someone else and they are fine with it however i still feel we could have gotten a lot more for our money with other laptops. Also heads up it only has one slot for ram stick. So its definitely not getting the full performance of the APU. Whats interesting is when i checked the available ram it states there is a total of 20 gb of ram. I suspect that the laptop has 4 GB of SOLDERED ram in addition to its 16 GB stick i found when opening it. So i did get what was advertised but don't buy it if you want to upgrade down the line you get more of your money getting a laptop with at least dual slots for ram

  Bought this for my wife and so far it has worked out very well. Unit responds quickly and runs nicely. The only issue I had was the bios setup for booting. The only thing there was the boot drive, and I could not get ASUS to understand or fix this issue which is very simple. Wanted the USB to be recognized so I could back it up.

  No gripes, works smoothly, screen is beautiful and keyboard is very responsive, with a very nice push under the keys. Works a lot better than my last XPS 13.

  bought this computer looking at specs thinking it will be better than my 2 year old HP Envy for every day tasks. But quickly learn that the benchmarks on this model are well below similar products with the same components. I changed the memory chip thinking this could be a bad batch but has barely made a difference. At this point I think the components on this thing are C- at best. Look somewhere else or buy from a brick store. GL

  I bought this machine to act as a portable home server. Its entire function is to run my automation programs 24/7. So the way I use it will most likely be far different from the average consumer. That being said upfront, here are the pros and cons I've run into so far.Pros:- Thunderbolt 4- Compact and lightweight- 11th gen Intel i5- The new Iris Pro graphics- Small bevel on the screen- Charges up fast- Upgradable RAM & M.2- Boots insanely fast (1.8 seconds)- Trackpad is very sturdy and niceCons:- Weak keyboard backlighting- Sound isn't very good (it's a tiny laptop, come on)- Light bleed around the top corners of the screen- Exhaust ports are directly behind the kbd - not on the bottom of the laptop- McAffee A/V is integrated several ways on the OS (more on this below)- Squishy keysConclusion:For $665 this is a decent laptop for my purposes. It sits on my desk with the screen closed, and I access it via remote desktop. I put a $35 laptop cooling pad underneath it, which as it turns out is worthless because there are no exhaust fans on the bottom of the unit.The keys were more squishy than I thought they'd be, and the backlight on the keyboard is very weak. On the flip side, the trackpad is actually very good. It has a fingerprint scanner built-in, and it's pretty accurate so far.There's considerable light bleed when the background is set to all black, and I was pretty shocked it was actually that bad. Luckily for me, I won't be using the screen all that much. I still might return it because of this, I'm on the fence about it.McAffee A/V is nested pretty deep in the operating system. I had to use Revo Pro to get rid of all traces of it, and it tried its best to fight back. There are folders on the C drive for the A/V which cannot be removed, even as the administrator, and that's no bueno.But is it fast? Yeah. It boots in 1.8 seconds, it ran my photoshop no problem, as well as my automation programs without a hitch (which are pretty cpu/ram intensive). I didn't try playing any games with it, as this is more of a creators/business type of machine. I'm sure it would do fine on some basic games.My final score: 3/5

  I've been a Surface Pro 3&4 guy for the past 10 years.  This out performs it on all levels and the Gen.11 Intels i5's can out preform some i7's this year.  So while it was fun transferring keyboards from unit to unit (4 times) I've had enough, and can honestly say that at this price point (and the fact that  half-life 2 plays flawlessly on it) if this holds up I won't be going back to that eco system.  The USB C and the extra USB 3 are a nice touch, I appreciate that kind of fore thought.  ASUS had TSTogether when they made this machine good job.

  I miss not having a touchscreen or a 10-key number pad, but I knew I was making those sacrifices, when I bought this laptop. The only real ""negatives"" are when you bring it back from standby/sleep mode, it's quite slow to reconnect to applications that were in use, and certain basic functions, like screen brightness, will suddenly fail to work, until updates are downloaded. I really love the look and portability, and the screen quality is great. I'm mainly using it for basic internet browsing and streaming, so it's perfect for that.

  I bought this Asus Vivobook as my new business laptop - and wanted a dependable, lightweight machine to travel with. It has everything I was looking for: good battery life, matte screen, speedy processing, good quality loudspeakers, even a nice exterior design that sticks out from the rest. So I am happy with the purchase so far. There is only one thing I am a bit disappointed about: The screen is so dimly lit that I am using it on 90-100 percent brightness all the time. Usually I am setting my computers to about 50-60 percent.

  Revised - crashes at least daily.  Tried all online fixes.  Total piece of poo!!  Don't buy!!!  I really like the speed, size, features and overall everything, with the exception of the keyboard. I did not check to see if the laptop came with a backlit keyboard - my bad. It did not, which is not a big deal. However, depending upon the angle you view them from, the keys are a little hard to see - for non-backlit keyboards, I would suggest ASUS make the keyboard lettering stand-out more.UPDATE:  Laptop keeps freezing-up to the point where ctrl-alt-del won't even pull it out of the freeze.  Happens at least once per day.  Have tried looking online for solutions.  Nothing I have found works yet.  Will update, if I find a solution.  Dropping rating from 4 to 1 star.

  For the price I paid, this laptop can't be beat.  I applied for an Amazon Store Card while purchasing, which gave me a $40 instant credit, further knocking down the price.This laptop is small and thin for a 15.6"" screen (fits in my 14"" laptop sleeve), very light (only 3.7 lbs), and fast (8th gen i5 and 8 GB RAM).  As others have said, the only downside is the slow 5400 RPM 1 TB hard drive.  As far as that goes, I have a trick to get around it if you're planning to install an SSD.  Alternatively, I also have advice if you're planning to stick with the included hard drive.  Here it goes.If you're planning to upgrade to an SSD drive and already have the SSD drive in hand, then do this to avoid the slow hard drive headaches:1. Boot up the new laptop for the 1st time.2. While activating Windows, DO NOT connect to your WiFi.3. After Windows fully starts up, install disk cloning software (Macrium Reflect, Acronis, etc.) from a USB flash drive. You can't download the disk cloning software because you are not connected to WiFi.4. Shut down the laptop, open it up, and install your SSD drive.5. Turn on the laptop again. Use the disk cloning software to clone the hard drive onto your SSD drive.6. Turn off the laptop.  At this point you have a choice. You can either boot into the BIOS to set your new SSD drive as the default boot drive while keeping the old hard drive installed, or you can just remove the old hard drive to force the laptop to boot off the new SSD.7. Turn on the laptop and admire how awesomely fast it starts up from the lightning quick SSD!  :-)8. Now you can finally connect to your WiFi network and let Windows download and install all it's updates and security patches.The reason I recommend doing this is because you don't want to let Windows try to download and install hundreds of MB's of updates and patches while running off the dog slow 1 TB hard drive.  That would take a very long, long time.  And the slow hard drive will be at 100% disk utilization for hours or days while it's trying to download and install all these Windows updates.  As other people have said, the laptop will seem to freeze and be unresponsive during this time.  But by upgrading to an SSD drive BEFORE letting the laptop download and install Windows updates, the fast SSD will make this process go A LOT FASTER.And my tip for those people who don't plan to install an SSD drive and just keep using the included 1 TB hard drive:1. After booting up the laptop for the 1st time, activate Windows, and connect to your WiFi.2. Then leave the laptop on for a day or two and don't try to use it.  Why?  Because people have said it can take up to 2 days for the laptop to download and install all the Windows updates.  Trying to use it during this time, with the hard drive utilization pegged at 100%, would be a exercise in frustration.3. Then finally, after all the Windows updates have been downloaded and installed, reboot the laptop and use it as you wish.  The laptop should be fairly speedy now after the initial slowness from the updates.  Enjoy!

  Great no frills laptop and one of the few with the Ryzen 7 cpu and the AMD Vega 10 graphics. This is very fast out of the box with 12 gigs of ram,but after upgrading to 36 gigs of ram this thing screams. After adding a 1tb SSD I have more speed and capability then most desktops out there! No lighted keyboard or finger print reader but I don't need either. Speed is more important to me in a laptop and this beats most high end gaming laptops out there. The first reviewer said that this has an ethernet port but it does not have one. It also lacks an optical drive. Most do not need either. That is how Asus keeps this laptop so thin. If one needs an ethernet port just simply use a USB ethernet adapter. The wifi works very well. If one needs an optical drive, just use an external one. They are very cheap.  Adding a 2.5 hard drive is easy. Simply buy a kit that includes mounting hardware and a cables.

They wanted something with a big screen but was still portable.For just checking emails, word processing, editing excel spreadsheets, & zoom meetings, it's a bit overkill.

As expected, it remained silent & cool to the touch performing these non strenuous tasks.Everything loads very quickly thanks to the nvme ssd.Webcam quality is acceptable (not amazing but not unbearable). Fine for conference calls, but a content creator would likely not be satisfied.Keyboard is comfortable to type on.Screen looks good & the hinge seems pretty unique. Hard to explain but it's satisfying to open & close it.Battery life seems to be ~4 hours using Microsoft word on moderate brightness. Definitely keep your charger with you.Plenty of ports. Multiple traditional USB ports, headphone jack, micro SD card reader, and even USB type C.Overall I definitely recommend it for people who are in the market for a 17.3 inch laptop that can handle moderate workloads.

  My laptop died yesterday, suddenly. My computer programming major son found me a few Asus options he would recommend and I ordered it from Amazon, it arrived next day. It seems great EXCEPT it has silver keyboard keys with silver typeface for characters. It seemed hard to see in the daytime but I thought it was the bright lighting in my office and the glare. It's nighttime now - and the keys are invisible, in multiple rooms, in myriad lighting, and to my children as well as me. On a high quality Asus. Useless.Who on earth thought it was a good idea to make keys so hard to see? I fine tuned the model down to the most careful specs and have the perfect laptop in every way but that I can't see the damn keys. Neither can anyone else in my family. Ends up there are two models, one that has backlighting and one that does not. THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE THE BACKLIGHTING FUNCTION.Why on earth would they mass produce laptops with invisible letters that require back lighting at a minimum but then sell models that don't have the back lighting feature??? Anywhere the artificial or natural light lands the keys are invisible. You have to move your head back and forth for every keystroke to get the key out of the glare to see the letter. I am so, so disappointed and Asus customer support is detached from the main office and was no help.They should have let me talk to someone who could explain how I am supposed to use this design or offer to replace it with a backlit version. Instead, I have to go through Amazon to return it when I think Asus customer service should have been all over it. Extremely disappointed in the product AND the customer service. They sent me to an online form that has a technical loop that gets you nowhere and has no phone number for customer support other than the call center which is no help and has no direct number to Asus.I went to the internet looking for an Asus and selected the vendor, not went to the vendor and settled on an Asus. My relationship, in my mind, is with Asus and they should be the ones to make it right. I am shocked that such an obvious design flaw was ever approved and pushed out into the marketplace and it has changed my opinion about Asus.Returning it.

  pros: pretty fast, must have strong wifi.  sound is pretty good.  screen quality is very good.keys have good feel.  I'm typing at a great pace with a good ""feel"".  I'm on a cooler on a solid table.nice looking, but plastic, hope it wears well.first thing get your updates in.  that takes a while.cons: keyboard key caps lettering hard to see. poor contrast with silver & darker gray lettering.  this looks great but is not a pro for usage.  when you move the screen it flexes and shows lcd bleed - harmless but shows lid is flimsy.this is my 2nd ASUS, I do IT for a living.  have lost my allegiance to other brands, if ASUS was to fix some little things they would improve their market share.  my original ASUS still works, from XP to windows 10!of note, I had to turn hardware acceleration off on chrome browser.  it made black window for some news videos while they were loading or maybe buffering... not sure.  but easy enough to fix.the wifi on this laptop (using it now) is low bar compared to my other laptops.  I turned power saving off etc, and other tips I found.  none helped. I basically sit slightly sideways on the work area to get the connection I need.I've seen this before.  typically as updates roll out this improves.  I hope this is the case.overall a good value.

  I am astonished at the specs: the at present most powerful consumer laptop CPU (AMD Ryzen 7), and a good GPU in a 700 dollar machine!  The negatives are the hard-to-read keyboard (grey letters on silver keys) and perhaps the lacking touch screen.

  Full Disclosure:  I have not purchased THIS laptop but have a similar model and I'm a geek on this stuff.  So hear me out.  The four star rating is based upon a similar model I bought 1.5 years ago.If Covid has you stuck at home and want a desktop computer -- many are beginning to eyeball 17 inch units as the best of both worlds.  You can move it around the house and yet have a big screen.The Vivobook line of Asus is budget oriented.  If you can spend twice this asking price without feeling it consider the LG Gram or similar units.  If $699 is painful right now -- this is a steal all things considered.SCREEN -- Asus Vivobooks have been featuring a strange 'in between' screen on these units.  It's not as vivid as a better screen, but it's not 'blue and white' like the REALLY cheapo screens.  Those blue and white ones are awful and I wouldn't make my worst enemy buy them.  They can and will destroy your eyes.  The Vivo screens run colorful enough and definitely sharp at 1080p.  If you're not a photographer or video editor -- if you're just doing office stuff, school work, surfing -- you're good to go.KEYBOARD --  My wife loves the keyboard but some reviewers take issue that the letters are white and the keys are silver -- which means -- they can be tough to see.  TRUE.  But if you know how to type pretty well you're rarely looking at the keyboard.  Right now I'm typing from a Lenovo Flex 14 that has charcoal keys with white letters.  Very easy to see... but I'm not looking at them, am I?  My wife never complains.STORAGE -- 1.5 years ago I bought my wife the 15.6 inch version of this laptop.  It had half the storage (256 SSD) for the same exact price.  So that's a WOW upgrade.PROCESSOR -- Intel took a nap a few years ago.  While they were sleeping AMD awoke from their decade long stupor and have created shockingly fast processors that not only compete with Intel but are cheaper and run cooler.  Translation:  plenty of pep for the buck.  I can't speak of fan noise but I presume there's very little -- since my wife's Intel is almost always silent but runs hotter than these AMDs.BUILD QUALITY -- It's plastic but sturdy.  It's also light to carry around.  Asus has this thing that when you open the unit it lifts the back end up a little, making typing easier and keeping airflow moving under the unit.  Win/win.  Of course this isn't a metal MacBook Pro 16 inch -- but you can buy 3.4 of these for one of those.BATTERY -- Watching tons of YouTube reviews of AMD laptops I've gotten the impression they aren't the best with batteries.  My AMD Lenovo isn't... just say 3 or so hours before you need to plug it back in.  I have no idea about this Vivobook but let's presume it's not an all day out and about student laptop.  Although the charging bricks on these things are really small and so if you can plug in it's no big whoop.SOUND -- I always laugh at reviewers that review the sound of a laptop.  Most 17 inchers live in homes or offices.  In other words -- mostly stationary.  Drop $25 and get yourself a nice portable bluetooth speaker from Anker or whoever if sound matters to you.  It will humiliate the best laptop speakers AND give your phone a speaker too.To prove I'm not shilling for Asus (but simply bored at home) a cheaper desktop computer option with a bigger and better screen would be a Beelink U57 (Intel Core i5-5257u 8GB RAM 256GB SSD, Mini pc) and a nice big monitor of your choice.  Not as fast but will do the office school work thing fine, not portable, but like $500 for all of it.

  Very happy with the computer overall.  My only beef, as others have mentioned, is that some rocket scientist decided that it would be a good idea to use faint medium gray markings on silver colored keyboard keys - keys that are NOT backlit.  Thanks for the hassle of that.  Notebook computers are often used in casual settings where there is fairly low light, why would you not use dark black lettering on the keyboard keys so you can actually see what key you are pressing?  I regularly have to guess what key I'm pressing.  Luckily I'm a touch typist, so not too much problem for the alphabetical keys, but for numbers or special characters, it's definitely a hassle.

  The specs are great. In fact, everything is great, if you don't buy this computer as a gaming unit like I did. Even the price is great, but there's a trade-off: The touchpad is terribly and horribly wonky. It right clicks all the time, even if you are deliberately left-clicking for the fourth or sixth time in a row. This has caused me endless frustration whenever I'm on the move and do not have a stable surface to rest the laptop on...which is the primary reason one buys a laptop in the first place.I installed the recommended updates for the touchpad, but it just keeps right-clicking on its merry way...oblivious to the needs of its owner. All of those clicking problems go away when a mouse is used. The unruly touchpad is the only issue I have with this purchase, but its a major one. It's one that greatly impacts my experience to merit it a one-star rating. When compared to a driving test, it is one of those that are one the ""Automatic Failure"" category.

  The specs of this system are nice for the price.BUT, the keyboard keys are silver engraved with grey letters, and NOT backlit on this model.From many angles, there is not enough contrast to see the letters on the keys.

  This product had A LOT of problems. First the touchpad was extremely unresponsive. I tried updating the drivers for the touchpad and even after doing so the touchpad still seemed fairly unresponsive. Next, the network adapter seemed to have issues. When connected to my wifi the signal strength was poor, but when connected with another laptop (that was 6 years older) right next to this machine I had full strength connection to my wifi. Lastly, I don‚Äôt know if it was the RAM but opening applications took forever. My old  Lenovo from 5 years ago could start visual Studio 2019 almost 2x faster than this new laptop.The reviews look great for this product so I‚Äôm confused why my experience was so horrible.

  So the wife had an HSN gift card for Christmas. I needed a computer because my desktop was still running on Windows 7, and yalls know, mircosoft does not support any more security updates on windows or update their product etc, Anyway -When I went to HSN to shop, their HP 17"" was running Ryzen 3, had less RAM, (8), same SSD with 512. windows 10 etc. Our gift card was for $50.00 at HSN. I almost pulled the trigger.  I stopped and  dove into Amazon.I saw this Asus, Vivobook for the same price as the HP on HSN. But, it has a better chip, Ryzen 7, It had more RAM, with 20 & not 8, it had the same SSD with 512.  . I was like, damn,, I know Asus products are awesome. I already own their routers and gateways for my house.Anyway, right under the price at Amazon, if you apply for the Amazon card, it is 0% interest for 12 months, AND they give you $100.00 off via a gift card if you apply / get accepted etc..It was a no brainer. I applied, got my 0% for 12 months, got received my instant gift card ( WHICH WAS APPLIED TOWARDS MY PURCHASE ), and I have a faster, sleeker computer. Win Win Win for me.The system itself is awesome, I need to get used to a notebook for i have always been chained to my desk with my desktop,  But this Vivobook is sleek, smooth, fast, flawless in my opinion.  The SSD is awesome, no moving parts, so it just boots up, and go.  I plan on eventually buying an external ssd for storage of important dox, etc. but damn, I love this computer!Thank you BrownBox, Amazon & Asus for this upgrade & gift certificate and awesome price.!!Happy Camper.!P.S.  The Vivo Book will be paid in full in 3 months

  I have owned this computer for three months.  It has been great in every aspect, except for battery life.  I leave it plugged in most of the time, but when I do unplug it, the battery seems to die too fast.  So, I would not recommend it if you expect to use it on battery power alone most of the time.

  I haven't had this laptop long, but coming from a 10 year old Toshiba, this Asus is amazing. It is NOT a touchscreen which really makes no difference to me.Some other reviews mentioned the color of the lettering on the keys being a problem, and they're right. To use this laptop in any low light setting is a little difficult. I wear glasses and my eyes aren't terrible but the glare that comes across the keys makes things inconvenient at times. I, personally, don't mind it because I don't need to look at the keys to type, but for people who do, you may want to upgrade to the other keyboard that has the darker keys.I'm not a gamer so I'm not able to comment on whether or not this laptop is great for gaming. I can run Chrome & Edge (with multiple tabs open), Email, and other various applications with minimal to no lag/hesitation.Overall, this is a great laptop thus far and I would certainly recommend this laptop, or laptop brand, to anyone of any computer skill level.

  Now this is my first windows 8.1 computer, and my first Asus as well. Yes, it is made of aluminum-like plastic. But I can hardly consider that a complaint. For a computer its size, its pretty light, and feels sturdy enough. This laptop is fast, holds charge pretty well, and is visually appealing. Read the specs, it packs a wallop of features. I use it for business purposes, and recreation while traveling.I rarely use the built in speakers, but no one should expect good bass (which is the common problem) from speakers this size. I have a Creative D100 to use as portable speakers.The one real complaint I can summon is that doesn't have the best screen resolution. Its not bad either, but I'm used to better. That could be a problem if you are into photography editing. It also should have been antiglare, but then again I think that wouldn't feel nice on a touchscreen.Oh, and  I could do without the Asus bloatware though. None of it is useful to me.I was going to give it 4/5 because of that, but the DVD drive is a very rare feature in computers this size.I needed a portable computer with an SD card, slot, camera, bluetooth, and DVD Drive. This baby has all I asked for. Nice looks. Light. feature packed and out performs most. I definitely love this laptop.

  It's 2017 and after only 4 years of relatively light and stationary use, this computer has failed me. It's dust magnet, the keys stick, and the biggest issue is that the audio jack has stopped working for no reason. I want to reiterate that i used this lightly - no moving, banging, and only used indoors. I'm disappointed that it hasn't held up. The ram also wasn't enough - when all i did was have itunes and a browser open, it would freeze. Next time I'll go more powerful.

  This is very unreliable notebook. During the first year I sent it for repair 3 times! Display, motherboard, power button were replaced. Finally, after many negotiations with the ASUS rep, it was replaced  for a refurbished one. Three month after, one of the buttons on keyboard fell off and I do not really want to contact ASUS again for repair as it takes so much time to move all programs and documents out and then re install them. Moreover, I will be without a computer for at least 18-30 days again. So, I use it without down arrow key. This unit costs much to expect a proper functioning and decent quality. I stopped keeping files on the notebook's hard drive as I worry it will quit one day again and I will loose my files. It is my first negative feedback in my life and unfortunately it is for the ASUS product. I could have bought a better notebook for this price.Update 08/19/15It's already 5th time it stops working for the same reason - it does not turn on. ASUS support is not going to repair it for free as it's out of warranty.

  I'll be honest this laptop could be a lot better. It's fast,  but could be faster for the price. The keyboard isn't backlit but it should be at this price and the screens colors are dull; also the brightness is mediocre at best. I keep trying to turn up the brightness thinking it's down when it is all the way up. Then there is this stupid asus help button next to the backspace button that I constantly hit. It's super aggravating! To top it all off, not sure if it's a hardware issue or what but the HDMI stopped working. It's not my cord or tv because I tested it on my now six year old sony vaio and it works fine. I want to return but at this point I just don't think I am going to find a decent sized touchscreen asus or lenovo laptop an with i7 core in it. Definitely disappointed. Wish vaio didn't sell it's name.

  4.5/5Starting off with the ""negatives"" so far. I have owned this laptop for a mere 11 hours yet I am satisfied. I know the screen is just average but I knew what I was buying so not complaint there. The only thing that has been bothering me so far is the spacebar. I am not sure if it is defective or if it is built this way but there are times when the key does not register me pushing down. I suppose I will just have to get used to it.I have played 2 games on it so far, Minecraft and Counter Strike: GO. I played both on the highest settings possible with 45+FPS, never dipping below. I am more than satisfied. It took some playing around with the NVIDIA control panel to switch from integrated graphics but it is just a google search away.I have not felt any slow moments or felt as if the laptop was being overwhelmed by my numerous tabs and applications. The start up time is about 20-30 seconds which is just fine with me (SSD coming soon, possibly just a mSATA SSD for bootup). Meanwhile, the charger is pretty freaking cool.The pictures online do not justify how beautiful this machine actually is. The screen size will turn off some people but because of how large the laptop has to be but it is perfect in my opinion. I will have to find a bag that can accomodate this the portability was never a serious issue (I use my iPad/paper for the ridiculously super tiny desks they have in some lecture halls at my university). As time goes on I will update this review but so far so good.

  I've got it for about 2 weeks and even though it has some minor issues (mainly the bloatwares which can be *quite* easily uninstalled), overall it works great. Windows 8 is of course a pain, but Classic Shell got me through it. Touchscreen is intuitive and very helpful when I'm too lazy to reach for the mouse. Speaker sounds good enough for an average music listener like me; and webcam is high quality. Touchpad is okay, nothing spectacular but I'm not using it much anyway so that's not a big problem. Unlike some other reviews I have no problem with the keyboard at all, typing feels really comfortable. 1TB storage and the optical disk drive are great bonus. One thing you should notice is that there is only 1 jack for both the headphone and the mic so choose your headphone accordingly. Also, it's a little bit heavy to carry around. And under sunlight the screen glare is so strong it's almost blinding. But overall for college this laptop is all you need (and more).

  This is probably the best laptop I have ever owned.  It is compact yet has a large 13.3"" screen.  Sound quality and volume is fine, screen is bright, keyboard is responsive, and the battery lasts a good four-five hours when streaming videos.  And recharging is quick.  The machine is well-built and after two months I have gotten use to the oddly placed power button.  This is a reconditioned machine purchased from Amazon and it arrived looking brand new.  Do be prepared for quite a bit of software updating during the first two days of use, including new drivers for the sound system that fixed a bug.

  This sleek and light laptop exceeded my expectations in terms of Its performance. It is so fast and there are no lags or no freezing. I don't play games but I use a very sluggish translation software and I can open 10-20 tabs in google and office programs at the same time with no problem (I was not able to use my translation software together with google in my old and sturdy asus i3 and this is such an upgrade for me). It opens in a second. So far I am really happy with the purchase and definitely recommend to someone who is looking for a sleek, sturdy, well priced work horse with good performance!

  I have had my Asus ZenBook for a couple months only.  The look & feel is nice and I was really happy when I received it and like besides this issue.  I repeatedly have to go through this hoopla where I am not able to power it on even though it is charged.  I called for tech support and was instructed to plug into the power source and hold the power button down for 20 seconds.  Then I am to disconnect the power source and turn it on.  This action seems to work but, really?  Isn't this a bit weird that I randomly have to go through these steps to power on? Also the fan comes on a lot and makes a loud blowing noise even though the laptop is not sitting on a surface to block air flow.  Makes me concerned about the longevity I will have with my new laptop.

  I got this for a work-from-home laptop. Was looking for something small and very light weight for when I sometimes travel. It was definitely smaller than i had expected. I added some photos with the Asus laptop next to my 13.3 in Macbook air and 11 in iPad Pro. I expected it to be the same size as my Macbook but was surprised when it turned out to be smaller in length and width.I‚Äôm an accountant so I use mainly Microsoft teams app, One Drive, some basic internet browsing/emailing, Excel/Word/PPT, occasional virtual meetings, and some accounting software. Haven‚Äôt experienced any major problems though i‚Äôve only had this laptop for a little over a week. The battery life is okay ‚Äî not the best. I could probably work a full 8 hour shift and at the end of the day, it‚Äôll be at about 30% ish battery. I keep it plugged in mostly so I don‚Äôt really have any complaints with its battery life. There were about 2-3 instances when i had a lot of apps open and when trying to open a file, the computer glitched (the screen turned black) for a millisecond..I also use this laptop to play LOL and haven‚Äôt experienced any issues at all! I just love how beautiful the color is and how lightweight it is. I don‚Äôt use the number keypad too often as i find it not as comfortable though it is a nice additional feature!One thing i dont like is that there is only one USB port. Which means i can either charge my phone with my laptop or connect my wireless mouse with the USB port - but can‚Äôt do both. :( also there is no headphone jack but it did come with a USB C adapter for headphones.Lastly‚Äî i looked on the Asus website and i believe this laptop was supposed to come with a sleeve but mine did not. It came with a charger (USB C Charger) and a USB C to headphone jack adapter.

  I was surprised by that laptop. It is really cool. Linux-friendly. Very fast, silent, light, does not get hot. Battery holds 6-7 hrs, great keyboard, great keyboard layout. Battery promised 67Wh, however, it is only 65Wh. Anyway, I enjoy it, it is perfect.

  I purchased this for all the reasons one buys a small, medium performance, thin laptop with capabilities for everyday tasks around working online, video conference calls (Zoom, Teams, Webex)  and enjoying videos on Youtube.  This is a fit for purpose laptop with features that support remote working/school quite well in a small form factor.The numeric light up keypad on the mousepad is a nifty feature and nicely overcomes the space limited keyboard of a laptop this size. After more than a month of day-to-day use the battery life typically lasts most of the day with moderate to heavy use for 6-8 of those hours.  If you are looking for a gaming machine this device is not for you.

  Have had this laptop for 1 month.  Since day one have noticed screen slowly fades dimmer and brighter.  No obvious cause.  Went into all kinds of settings and even uninstalled and reinstalled the graphic device driver.

  The specs were a bit weak. Only 8G memory (16G would be much better), with an I5 4 core cpu. No touch screen.Oh, no backlighted keyboard. Seriously?  The monitor is 14"", but they managed to keep the overall dimensions to the same as their older 13"" model, by needing less border around the screen. The video memory is shared  (uses a portion of the Ram) . Given that the 8GB ram is kinda on the low side already,  that is not ideal.Pretty sure the keyboard has no backlighting.  (The description says it does)Had a 512GB M2 drive, so that is good.  Wifi AX, so that is good.  A face detection capable modern camera (I think it takes infrared capability, not sure)  Windows 10 home preinstalled.  The M2 drive is big enough and makes a difference in perceived  responsiveness.  I get ~ 1.2 Gb  Wifi using the built in Ax adapter, so overall it is pretty Zippy.  Oh the built in audio is premium, H&K I think.It came down to this,  or a more amply provisioned Dell ( with 16G memory,  touch screen and an 8 core I7cpu, with dedicated ( non-shared) video memory.  The Dell would have been close to 2x the money.

  TL;DR = This has ALL the latest 2020 technologies! Typical price for a new high-end, slim, lightweight machine; speakers suck BUT this does some things better than others.Great: Screen brightness and clarity. Easily viewable from all anglesGreat: Battery life! this 65w battery lasts longer than alternative 40w laptop batteries.Great: backlit keyboard that is easy to type on. Also the trackpad is nice.Great: Has TWO USB-C 3.2 and ONE USB-A 3.2. I honestly don't understand why new laptops are being made with USB 2.0 still. These ports are amazing. Both USB-C ports allow fast charging at 65w; unfortunately they're both on the left side. I wish one was on the right in case my charging cable is to the right of me (minor complaint).Great: has the latest bluetooth and wifi standards so it's fast.Poor: The speakers suck. They face downward so if you're sitting at a table the sound will bounce back up. But if it's in your lap the entire audio gets muffled which is unfortunate.Poor: As mentioned above, I wish one USB-C charge port were on the right side.Poor: has MICRO-SD slot instead of standard SD slot. Users with DSLR's and standard SD cards will have to buy an external card reader.Minor complaint: The Oct 1 display driver update from INTEL disabled my screen brightness settings/buttons. I had to delete the driver and manually search for and download the prior driver from the manufacturer's website. A typical user or student might not understand how to do that. It was quite frustrating.

  Fast, reliable, amazing looking laptop.I have only bought Asus laptops for the past 10 years for a good reason, but I have to say this has been my favorite. Personally I find the color of this laptop to be beautiful, but to be objective, the materials of the exterior are durable, not a fingerprint magnet and easy to clean. The feeling when you press the keys could improve and be a little more firm, but it's not bad at all, it feels comfortable. The track pad is big and with the addition of a number pad this becomes very practical, although the light touch required for the number pad is not a substitute for a real one. The battery is more than enough for regular work like emails, browsing and such. It doesn't have a touch screen but I personally don't see the need for one in a laptop so that doesn't bother me. The quality of the image is really good, there is no bad angle and the bezel is very thin, making the entire thing small and easy to carry. Overall, the laptop is nice and light, comes with all the accessories you need (even a nice case for it) and lools like it's going to last for years before becoming obsolete.

  I have had this laptop for a month and am very impressed with it. The display is beautiful, its super thin and light-weight, and the battery life is amazing. The main reason I chose this particular laptop was power over USB-C. I have had no problems with using various devices on the USB-C ports, including a fully specced USB-C dock I picked up. I am able to run 2 displays, ethernet, and power all though a single cable. The laptop does get a bit warm when its working, but in normal use you won't feel it. Overall I am happy with my purchase.The only issue I'm having with it is sometimes the keyboard backlight will stop working. I have to toggle the backlight button on the keyboard to get it going again. It doesn't happen all the time, and its not a big deal. I'm sure a BIOS update will fix it sometime in the future.

  & this def did the trick. Aside from is pretty aesthetic (I got the dreamy white, it really is so cute and ""dreamy"" with its pink, purple, blue hues) it's SUPER light weight and FAST.

  This is a fantastic laptop. It‚Äôs lightweight and slim. It‚Äôs compact and I love how good the screen quality is. Also, the white is so pretty. I tried to get a picture of it reflecting the iridescence in the light. The battery lasts a long time and it charges pretty quickly. I love the backlit keyboard, though you don‚Äôt need it as often as a darkly colored keyboard because the dark letters have a nice contrast against the silver keys so there‚Äôs a good contrast without needing the light on and it saves on battery.

  Those three main things were the reasons why I bought this laptop. I got the Dreamy White which looks nice and looks light pink at some angles. I'm glad to finally have a lightweight laptop to travel with. Hopefully the borders open soon and coronavirus disappears. The sound is good, not excellent, but good. In heavy rain, it drowns out the sound but it's not that bad that you need to plug in earbuds. I just received this laptop 4 days ago and the two most annoying things about this laptop is the positioning of the on button and the wifi disconnecting every time the computer wakes up from sleeping. I had a Dell before and the on button was not incorporated into the keyboard. Moreover, it was not right next to the delete button. I always fear, I will turn off the computer mistakenly one of these days and it might just be a costly mistake. I checked to see if this was the normal positioning of the on button for Asus laptops and for some although it's incorporated on the keyboard, it's at least not right next to the delete button. My battery lasts for approximately 8 1/2 hours being on sleep mode at times and takes about 2 hrs 16 mins to charge to 100%.

  I'm always hesitant to buy computers from Amazon because of their return policy, but oddly, I have gotten the best ones I've owned from here. This is my second Asus computer purchased from them and once again, I'm extremely happy. My other Asus is still working, though it was getting older and it is larger. I needed something that was more portable with particular specs to run software for work, and this laptop fit the bill. I'm super pleased, especially after purchasing a Surface Pro elsewhere that got stuck on an infinite loop on startup on my second time restarting it. I ended up returning it immediately and purchasing this. I'm MUCH happier with this. I do wish it had just one more USB port, but I do have an external port to add extras. That's the trade off for the smaller size.

It is lightweight and checks all the boxes of the features I need.  The Ryzen 7 processor is super fast and boot up from opening the lid is about 5 seconds.  It comes with 3200 8gb ram which I will upgrade to 16gb soon.  The 1TB SSD is made by Intel and provides me with plenty of storage.  It has all the USB connections I need.  No USB-C charging, but I don't mind.  It is very lightweight and easy to carry around with my Macbook Pro in my backpack.My background is in software engineering and I have a Macbook Pro and PC on my desk.  This sucker is much faster that my 2018 Macbook Pro and I never hear the Asus CPU fan running.  I do hear the Macbook Pro fan running quite frequently and it is annoying.  This Asus is very quiet and runs cool.  But maybe it will run hotter if I stream a lot and play some intensive games.  I use this laptop for general purpose and my software development activities.  For that, it is perfect for me.  I'm still a Macbook guy and will continue to buy them because the technology and build quality ensures that it has the life cycle and 3 PC laptops without going obsolete.When I first got this, the new Windows 10 updates maybe took a total of 15 minutes.  There were probably 8 or 9 updates and they all downloaded and installed very quickly.  My other Lenovo Flex 15 laptop with the Intel 10nm 1065G i7 processor, 16GB memory, and 512 SSD took about 45 minutes to do a similar Windows 10 update.  I am very impressed with the 7nm Ryzen 7 processor.  This Asus is way better than the Lenovo.  Don't know if it is the Ryzen 7 or just the overall engineering of the Lenovo unit.  I do know that I built many PCs in the past with ASUS motherboards and was never disappointed.The only negative is that the screen can be brighter.  The screen quality is good, but additional brightness would be welcome.  As I use this indoors 99% of the time, I have no issues with brightness or being outside.  For those who want a nice screen, go pay the price and get something better.  Finally, the battery life is typically about 5 to 6 hours between charges.  It can probably go more, but I get battery anxiety and don't let the battery fall below 20% very often.  Other reviews regarding Asus Vivobook battery consumption were not based on the Ryzen 7 that I have seen and many were using Intel 10nm processors or other Ryzen processors that were not the 7nm technology.

  The Vivobook 15 is often compared and contrasted with the Acer Aspire 5. In my opinion the Vivobook is a far better choice!The Aspire looks nice and performs decently, and the screen is great for the price. But inside, it feels really cheap, with the battery not actually even being fastened in place at all. And the RAM expansion slot in the one I got didn't work and Acer tech support was entirely unhelpful. I returned it.By happy contrast, the Vivobook feels quite sturdy, almost like aluminum even where it's plastic, and the inside seems... not premium, but well built. And RAM installation (and SSD replacement) went smoothly. Great BIOS, too, the best I've seen.Mine *did* come with a 2.5 inch hard drive expansion caddy and connector in the box, which is a nice touch.I'm running Linux (openSUSE Tumbleweed) on it and it runs flawlessly. Just boot to BIOS and turn off Secure Boot and Fast Startup, then reboot to a USB flash drive with the installer for the distro of your choice.I do think the Aspire has a somewhat better screen. But the Vivobook screen is still fine for the price; not the most colorful, but brightness is adequate and text and images are sharp and clear.Very happy with my purchase!

  Pre-installed Win10 Home took only minutes to update and the AX200 chip handles all you can throw at it, and so does the Radeon graphics.  Screen quality awesome for a 1080p and sound quality A grade for Realtek...this thing flies and looks good doing it.  Would absolutely recommend as a top-of-the-line value book, head of it's class.

  Had problems with the battery immediately. Contacted both Amazon and Asus to try and solve my issue... My case keeps being passed on to somebody else and nothing has been done.

  CON: The keyboard and case finish are just ""OK"", but this is not an expensive laptop so that is acceptable.PRO: Laptop performance and screen are very good for the price paid. For any general purpose user (email, Spreadsheet, Word processing) it is more than adequate!I would give the laptop 4.5 stars. So why did I return the laptop?  Nowhere in the Sellers description does it indicate this is a refurbished or open box system.I am fine with open box or refurbs that carry full warrantee, but I am NOT fine with being MISLED.The contents included water damaged Getting Started booklet and  Best Buy warrantee registration card. Clearly those would not be inside a factory fresh package.  Having been misled called into question the whole transaction.

  Good laptop with a comfortable keyboard for my large hands. It's fast and I love it. Also, like with all new machines, make sure you spend the time updating your software.

  I bought the $999 i5 16GB C436 ($950 after a $50 discount on Amazon), and also a cheaper m3 4GB C433 (open box  but new $380 from Best Buy) , to compare them side by side.  My thoughts on the C436 after almost a week of use.Awesome:- The C436 is very fast.  It opens websites very quickly, can handle high resolution gaming, doesn't stutter with many open 1080p YouTube tabs.  It gets a little warm under heavy processing load, and you can hear the fan kick in, but it's pretty innocuous.  Asus has done a great job managing power and heat here (unlike the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook).  I am using it as a work from home station right now hooked up to a 27 inch monitor... I often forget I am not using my i7 Windows 10 desktop, it just flies!  The new U series processor is significantly quicker than the older Y series.- It is very light.  It weights almost 1 lb lighter vs the C433 (and just over half a pound lighter than the C434), which is an enormous difference for a 2.5 lb device.  The screen vs body weight is distributed well, doesn't feel too clunky in tablet mode.- Trackpad is fantastic - very smooth, fast, responsive... The C433 stutters and doesn't always capture fast swipes.  The C436 never fails, it's just great.  It's wider than the C434's trackpad (C433 also has the newer wider trackpad), and a pleasure to use.- Storage: 512 MB of space is fantastic, not used to that in your typical 32/64 GB budget Chromebooks.  I usually use a microSD card to store multimedia, but that's no longer really necessary, at least for the average user.- Aesthetics are great.  It's a beautiful device - the white screen cover looks lovely, and the silver body matches it pretty well.  Thin bezels, nice square body (better than the C434 which had a very sloped underside), very pleasing to the eye.- The fingerprint reader is a welcome addition, although I don't use it much.  It's quick, although it doesn't always recognize my finger.Ok:- The screen is ""meh.""  There are some inconsistencies across the online reviews - some hate it and rate it very dim (Chrome Unboxed), others praise it as vivid and bright (Laptop Mag).  Compared to the C433, it is a bit brighter, and more vivid - playing a video side by side on the two laptops really shows the difference, the colors on the C436 stand out much more.  It has great viewing angles as well.  That said, it is not very bright, it's visible outdoors but very dim in sunlight (marginally better than the C433).  Also, it has a weirdly warm/yellow electric hue to it, especially next to the C433.  Hard to describe, but I actually prefer the C433 screen better, even though the C433 screen is dimmer - it feels more ""matte"" (even though both touchscreens are equally reflective) and easier on the eyes, whereas the C436 makes my eyes strain more.  Anyway, it's not bad... but I am just surprised that a $1,000 device doesn't have a better screen.- The build is not great, much flimsier than I'd like.  The hinges are a bit loose, the screen moves around a bit when you type.  Comparatively, the C433 is rock solid - the hinges are very tight, screen doesn't move at all when you type or move the device around.  While the C436 isn't bad per se, I can imagine it getting significantly worse with time/wear.  The body itself feels a bit curved close to the screen - again the C433 feels better there.- Battery life is mixed depending on usage.  It discharges a bit quicker than the C433 when watching a looping video.  I would estimate roughly 8-9 hrs (I think the older C434 was closer to 11+; the C433 is similar to the C434 with closer to 10-11 hrs).  But in mixed use - browsing over WiFi - it discharges quicker., probably 6-7 hrs of use.  It's not bad, and it's significantly better than the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook, which can't seem to get 4 hrs mixed use (due to its admittedly gorgeous screen and same processor).  But it's not the 10 hrs we are supposed to be seeing from Chromebooks.- Keyboard is OK.  Not a ton of key travel, and the C433 is significantly better - much more pleasant to type on, with more travel.  But the C436 keyboard is good enough, and you get used to it quickly.  Asus also did a better job making the lit keys easier to see vs the C433/434.- Touchscreen is OK as well.  It's responsive enough, but I don't like how the scrolling works on the Asus devices (same on C433 and C436), once your finger leaves the screen after a fast swipe, the scrolling doesn't ""continue"" - it stops almost immediately.  My old Acer R11 feels way better from that perspective, more natural.- Ports/connectivity: good enough, has 2 USB-C ports and a microSD card.  The C433 also has a USB-A port, but I don't miss it all that much, easy to have a USB-C dongle to expand to more ports, HDMI out, etc.  I am using one now to ""desktopify"" the laptop.Bad:- Nothing is really bad... except for the webcam, which is kinda awful, pretty bad quality especially in low light - but it's there.  Hard to find any other faults, it's generally a very good device.- The price feels high, honestly.  Feels like this should cost $200 cheaper for the package.  But in a world of $1,000 Chromebooks, I guess the price is justified.  Maybe the i3 8GB version is good enough at $800.  To me (obviously subjective), the ""fair price"" would have been $600 for the i3 version and $800 for the i5 version.  But the fast CPU, lots of RAM and SSD storage may justify the price.

  Update - when scrolling, the screen started having glitch issues so I contacted Asus, they offered no exceptional service. Advised I could send it in for service and not have a computer for 10 days or return it. So I returned it. Very disappointing. To be fair to my first review, I found the laptop sleeve in the shipping box when I packed the computer to return. Not a very good packaging design - put everything in one box please Asus.Original post - So far I am a bit worried. Item received with a small chip in the finish near the hinge, not a big deal so we haven't done anything about it yet. A couple more small chips have appeared even with careful care, so we are going to reach out to Asus to see what they say. Our item DID NOT come with a cover as advertised, so that's another thing to look into. Besides that, the chromebook seems top notch, looks really upscale, touch pad is great, performs very well with higher than average memory and storage. So we will see....

  Real damn fast, and nearly perfect. The processor is a battery hog so one star for that, I haven't been getting more than 6-7 hours in a charge which is so much worse than the Pixelbook Go it's replacing. Still, the keyboard and touchpad are solid, and the screen (while not super bright) is pretty nice.If you're a Crostini person this Chromebook is for you.

  I added a picture to compare it against a 13 inch MacBook air.  This one is lighter and has the same foot print with a bigger screen.  I actually am graduating from a 13 inch dell Chromebook, which is bigger and heavier, yet using the Asus, the keyboard and screen feels like I'm working on a larger laptop!  I've been very happy using Chromebook for the ease of carrying and low maintenance.  I only bought this one as I needed to pass the dell to my online student.  I did my research to buy what I needed to work from home and to not worrying about buying another one in a couple of years.  I'm very happy with my purchase!  It's a very nice laptop.

  Since there are no reviews for this laptop I will try to be as thorough and succinct as possible. Bear in mind that I am not at all a tech wiz and I only had this laptop for a few days. For context, I bought this laptop to replace a 3 year old ASUS Zenbook (UX330UA) (after trying a Zenbook UX333FA and hating the keyboard). Overall I would say it is great BUT has some dealbreaker issues that I don't know how to fix so I am returning it.PROS:- Beautiful design. I love the silver and rose gold look (even though rose gold isn't my favorite color) and it really makes it stand out from the sea of silver and black ultrabooks. The thin bezels around the screen also made it look very clean and modern and there isn't a lot of wasted space. It's actually the same width as my old 13.3"" Zenbook but not as tall because of the thinner bezels so it is slightly smaller.- Lightweight but sturdy. It's much lighter than your average laptop and yet it is somehow still very sturdy. It's light but not so light that you would forget it was there, if that makes sense. The metal feels high quality and there wasn't much or any flexing in the case or the keyboard.- Great (maybe not exceptional) keyboard. The reason I bought this laptop in the first place was as an alternative to another Zenbook I tried that had a terrible keyboard layout. This one is much better and has a standard key placement (although I'm also used to Zenbooks so maybe other laptops are different). The keys are more soft than clicky but I don't mind that and I had no problem keeping up with my usual words per minute in a typing test.- Good screen. The screen was plenty bright for me and very colorful. My only complaint is that it seems a bit grainier/more pixelated compared to my 13.3"" computer but that seems to be due to both computers having the same resolution at different screen sizes.- Good port selection. I can't stand computers that only have USB-C/Thunderbolt ports and this laptop has plenty of different ports.NEUTRAL (things that could be considered good or bad but didn't bother me):- Fan was noticeable sometimes, like when I downloaded Microsoft Office. This doesn't bother me personally but might bother others.- Decent sound quality, although my hearing isn't the best so maybe other people would take issue with it.CONS:- Slow internet speeds? I don't know enough about computer to understand this, but based on the Google internet speed test, this laptop usually had 1/3 to 1/10 of the Mbps that my other computer did while they were both connected to the same wifi network. I even tried turning off my other computer to see if having multiple laptops on one network was the problem, but it stayed the same. For example, this computer had a download speed of 8 Mbps while my other computer had a download speed of 70 Mbps, at the same time. At other times the difference was not so dramatic but it consistently tested lower than my current computer (and another new laptop that I bought). I have no idea what caused this but it concerned me. Who knows, maybe it doesn't effect connection at all, but I thought it was strange.- Wouldn't wake up from sleep. After leaving it on sleep mode for a few hours, it would not wake up from sleep. At all. I tried pressing the power button, random keys, and the touchpad, but nothing turned it on. I had to do a hard restart to turn it back on. When I looked it up this is an issue other people have had, both with this specific model and with other ZenBooks. This is ultimately the problem that is making me return this laptop. Keep in mind that this only happened to me once in the 24 hours of having it, but I decided not to keep it because I was concerned about the fact that this problem arose in less than a day.So overall I would describe this computer as user-friendly, sturdy, and lightweight, but in my case unfortunately it came with a problem (that may not be found in all units of the same model). Hope this helps.

  once u take all the garbage off of it is a great little laptop for the non-hardcore gamer in your life. In my 15 years of exp, anything with the Asus label on i has been quality.

  Awesome computer. The graphics aren't the best. The color contrast is dull. The touch screen is also not the highest quality, but it's not the reason I bought this computer so it's okay. I appreciate the 10- key and the low cost for a computer with a SSD. Considering the low cost, it still accomplishes all I need it to for my grad school studies.

  This laptop is FAST. You cannot find a better 2-in-1 for the same price. Asus has always been a phenomenal brand, but this I5 and PCIe SSD are just as quick as my $3,000 custom built PC from 2017 at a fraction of the price.I had to give it 4 stars because the first laptop I received was not placed in the shell correctly. The aux port was blocked from going in and if it did go in, it scuffed up the shell of the laptop.

  I don't know what this computer would be like because we are returning it. Do NOT purchase from a merchant called Hot Tech Geek. We purchased this computer, but when it came it had an unlicensed, non-genuine, pirated copy of Windows 10. I am so angry because it was NOT listed as having a pirated version! Some sellers will do this illegally to save themselves money. Beware! We are returning this immediately. Do NOT buy from Hot Texh Geek!!!!

  This is my third laptop over the years. My last purchase was 11 years ago.  How did I ever get along without touch screen?  This feature makes everything easier to complete. The laptop is lightweight, yet it has a solid feel to it. The FHD screen quality is perfect for watching movies or viewing the news. My typical use is online browsing and after 5 or 6 hours the battery is still at about half charge.  The back-lighted keyboard is quite useful. The extra RAM assures plenty of space for file downloading.

  All in all, just feels like cheap junk.  There isn't a single aspect of the system that would cause you to feel you had purchased anything of quality.  Totally disappointed in this machine.Pros:  Battery life is good, & it‚Äôs light weight to carry.Cons:  Feels and performs like something costing $150.Case is so flimsy, it flexes on the bottom and top both as you pick the machine up and feels like it will crack.  They couldn't even make the lid easy to open.  It's like they gave zero thought to its actual use.Display is mediocre at best.  Sitting next to my 5 yr old surface, it's obviously inferior.Camera quality is so bad it's honestly unusable.  Seriously, I could not overstate how bad.  Extensive pixilation, poor light response, poor color, it's the whole package.  You can buy a child's toy with a camera that is WAY better quality.  (Yeah, I actually have a child's toy with a camera that is much better.)Trackpad touch response seems like it varies back and forth on required force.  Sometimes it's on, the next minute it isn't.  When the number pad is open, normal trackpad function is very impaired.  So, you basically get one or the other, and if you don't have a mouse, that's going to be a problem.  So, number pad becomes a non-feature.Keyboard feels like a toy.  Difficult to use and makes the experience frustrating.  Key travel is ridiculously long, key pressure is excessive, power button is right where a delete key would normally be, so you constantly hit it by mistake.Customer service is a 48 hour email response...on a new purchase... wowNot even a touch screen, which I guess I failed to notice on the listing.  Who makes a Windows machine without a touchscreen??SD Card reader is upside down.  Just about tore up a card trying to figure out what was wrong.  There's even a picture by the port that shows a card in the WRONG orientation for the port.  If you're going to add a picture, at least make it helpful!Other ports such as USB-C seem flimsy and connectors wiggle when plugged in to them.I could go on, but basically, the whole machine is cheap junk.  I can't believe ASUS gets these reviews.  Maybe I'm spoiled by having a Surface previously.  But, I would have expected to have a much better machine.So disappointed in this.  I will likely return it.

  Love the laptop other than one flaw. It doesn't wake up when it goes to sleep. I had to change all the power settings to not turn the screen off because if it does for an hour or more it won't wake. This seems to be an issue with many people that have zenbooks. I reached out to asus support and they gave me a list of things to try. If I can't get it to work I'm probably going to return it and get something different. Shame because I love everything else.

  So far I really like this laptop however the amazon specs specifically said ""Voice command- Touchscreen with Stylus Support.""  Not sure what voice command has to do with a touch screen and stylus support but there is no touchscreen.Also multiple unboxing videos will show that the unit comes with a laptop sleeve and a network (cat5) to usb dongle.  NOT so from amazon.  The box had a spot for the laptop sleeve but no sleeve or dongle was included.  Not a huge deal since the laptop itself is an incredible machine but if you were hoping to have those included not so from the supplier.

  The Asus Zenbook 13.3 UX325 has been better then I even expected. While the battery life is tracking at about 7 to 8 hours its more than enough to get through a day and with super fast USB-C charging, I have no problems at all. I perfer a laptop on the small size but this one is small and thin, yet still has two USB C ports a HDMi port and a micro sd slot... wow.. the touch pad keypad is not very good, but rarely needed.  Speed wise, this thing really sings. Lots of apps open including heavy duty software like Revit and no issues with lag or pop up.  The Harmon Kardon sound is loud and has great depth to it. This is a great laptop at 750ish. Intel i5 and 8 gb ram are more than enough for what I need it for, but its no gaming laptop.

  After 10 years of not having a personal laptop, I got this zenbook 13, with 8RAM and 256GB. I'm giving this 1 star review because I had to return it.The issue I encountered was the laptop would not wake up from sleep mode, it happened pretty much on the first day after setting up my account and after charging the battery. When I closed the lid or the computer went on sleep mode while being idle the screen would turn black, there was a small light on the side that would flick, but the one on the power button wouldn't flick. I couldn't turn it on with the mouse, the power button, or any key. The only way of turning it back on would be holding the power button for over 20 seconds and resetting. This was very annoying as technically you would need to be on permanently on the laptop so you wouldn't risk having to reset and lose anything you would be working on. Checking online this seems like a common issue with Asus computers. I called customer service and followed some directions, but this didn't fix the situation. Therefore I decided to return.The laptop is small, lightweight, pretty, fast, stylish and feels nice. The port selection is great as well. I think the speakers were nice.The battery life seemed a bit off, like it would say 15 hours and then go down to 8 and to 3, but it would go back up. The keyboard wasn't my favorite, I felt it a bit uncomfortable and hated the location of the power button, would constantly tap on while wanting to delete. I would say if you are still planning to get it buy the zen 14 as it might offer more resting arm space and better key layout.

  So, there are a few different versions of this S15 around and it can be a bit confusing. At first, I thought the version with the screen touchpad was older, but then I saw that the ASUS website had both kinds.I have to say the screenpad is BETTER than I thought. It easily switches from touchpad to screenpad and back. It's very easy to use and better as a touchpad than any I have used before. I do not see much need to carry a mouse now, and that will decrease the bulk. Also, the charge cord and wall wart are small, but the length is good.This looks and feels like a high quality laptop. No question about it. I got the Moss Green version... it's only that color in some lighting. In other lighting it's more of a bronze color, but both colors are awesome. The screen is nice, and I don't miss my old 17"" laptop that's 6 years old.ASUS bloatware was almost non-existant. I did upgrade to win 10 pro as I needed that functionality.I noticed a disconnect while using the 5g channel on a router... we will see if that's an issue going forward.The only real con I see is the lack of a detachable battery.

  I bought this to use as a school lap top and when I need to watch videos for school I have to wear headphones to actually hear it. The sound is so low. I thought even with the reviews I read about the sound it would be ok, but no. I do not recommend this laptop. Also, the screen pad is only useful if you need to do certain functions that the advertisement shows. If not, it's just annoying and constantly turns itself off and on.

  I have had this laptop for almost two months now and use it mainly for work and now I‚Äôm having a bit of fun running emulators on it and it works pretty smoothly. My only issue is the screen has blacked out for a few seconds twice now. I‚Äôm not sure what that is but weird. I also think they can improve on the screen pad. It‚Äôs a bit annoying when you are taking a screenshot and that comes up in it as well (although I found there‚Äôs a function to select what you want to screenshot but that‚Äôs one extra annoying step) bf the handwriting function is in a way useless. I thought I would be able to use it to sign documents however that‚Äôs not it‚Äôs function. It works in a really strange way. You might as well just type. Other than that? No complaints, great product !!!

  Solid laptop. Works great.Couple things to note though. For you to have best laptop experience, make sure you change out the memory to at least 16 gigs system ram. Already a couple games have complained that 8 is not enough.Also, get another NVMe SSD m.2 drive. At least 512 Gigs. Install it in the 2nd slot. It will save you from having to swap out windows. So now I have two drives in my system.Also, when you first turn it on... do NOT hook up to the internet. Uninstall all the apps and software that microsoft and Asus has installed. Leaving bare bones drivers. Reason being is that you will have to manually turn off all the spyware that both ASUS and Microsoft pre-install. Once you do this manually, then on another computer, get a copy of ccleaner and copy it to a USB drive and copy it to your new laptop. Install it and run it. You can always look on youtube on how to install it. ( NOTE : While you are at it, get a copy of your favorite browser, like firefox and copy it to your USB too. ) Once CCleaner is installed, then Reboot. Then you can run the ccleaner and uninstall all other apps that MS hides from you. Look at everything. Pay attention to the cookies too. ( This is all done before you even hook up to the net. )Once you have done all the uninstalling you can do. Go into settings and turn off everything that is about data collection. ( SIDE NOTE : Microsoft has about 300+ websites you will connect too if you do not turn all of this stuff off when you run windows. ) Once every setting has been scrutinized to your liking, then reboot.. and plug in your internet. Immediately install Firefox ( or whatever browser you use ) and get that working. If you do not like Microsoft spying on you, DO NOT USE EDGE !From there, reinstall the NVidia drivers, but make sure NOT to install the ""NVidia Experience"". ( Choosing Gaming version of the drivers is fine though. ). The reason is, the exerpience is a data collection program and only uses more CPU power and internet bandwidth that you could be using for something else.Once the NVidia updated drivers are installed, then run your windows 10 updates and you are good to go.Also... the Armoury program, reinstall that. You will need to look up ASUS Armoury install on a web search. You'll find an uninstall and and install. Run the uninstall first, reboot, run the install a second time, reboot and then run the installer. Once you do that, set the FAN to silent and that will take care of the fan problem.YES everyone complains about the fan, but once you fix all of the above, the laptop runs smoothly and silent, except in games.This all may seem ""Tin Foil"" to some, but keep in mind, all this spyware not only uses up your computer processing power, it also slows down your net. And it all adds up. So this is why this is important. You can NEVER stop all spying, but you can surely limit it to a comfortable level.Hope this helps others.EDIT UPDATE  ( Feb 2nd 2021 ) : Laptop still runs good. And ever since I did the above instructions, my fan speed has been quiet. So far so good. The Price is worth it for this kind of laptop. However, if you are one who is looking at an extreme gaming experience playing games like Star Citizen, then this laptop is not for you. If you play casual games but still like games like Empyrion, this laptop does just fine. I also have played Dual Universe on this laptop. Little laggy, but still playable.So point being, this laptop can hold it's own, IF you remove all the spyware off of it first.

  So far the computer has been great. The only reason for the 4 star is that the track pad doesn't always work as it should. It's very hard to move. The screen isn't as bright and the speakers aren't as loud as a laptop should be. They aren't much louder than my note 8 speakers.

  after my hp turned to crap, I set out to find a new laptop. My entire family bought asus products, and only one of them has ever had a virus. I've had this laptop for ALMOST A YEAR. it still runs perfect! I sometimes play games that can be intensive, but this laptop handles it with ease. I do have a stutter every once in a while, but nothing a restart can't fix.Good things:-quiet fan, only hear it during very intensive games, and the laptop gets warm, but never hot.-nice screen. No complaints here-battery is fine. Nothing too great, but hey, that's why we have long chargers!-the touch screen is so useful-upgraded to windows 10 and my only problem is the rotation doesn't work correctly.Bad:-sometimes, maybe once every 3 months, the touch screen won't respond when I power it on, but restarting always fixes that.-the bezels are kinda big, but that doesn't bother me. Just put that here because some people look for great bezels.-I really wish the hinge wasn't as stiff as it is, I have to hold down the keyboard while I open the lid.Overall, it deserves 6 stars. Amazing laptop, and I look foward to this laptop being reliable in the future. Although I haven't had a need to get it repaired, I've heard great things about their customer service as well!

  Loving this laptop so far! This laptop is fulfilling all my needs and meeting all my expectations so far. The 1TB hard drive space is split in to two 500 GB, which is not entirely ideal, but I'm not entirely picky since I'm not using it for gaming purposes. There is no CD reader, which many have mentioned before and expected such. I love the flipping into tablet mode. It does tend to get rather hot when you flip it completely after X amount of hours, so I advise having it in complete tablet mode for more than a couple hours to prevent it from overheating. Speakers are okay, not the best, but okay. Those that wish to have good speakers, you may as well have a headset. Slim and relatively light, it is quite portable. I do have an issue with setting up the internet. You have to manually do everything from the network options, which can be tedious and annoying especially if you're at a Starbucks or something that requires a web page popup, it does not pop up with the webpage when you try to connect through the automatic way.  Touch pad is responsive. It sometimes detects two fingers when I only have one on it. The touch pad is extremely versatile, meaning there are different ways to use it properly and no real wrong way. It has buttons on the left side of the laptop, so be wary of where your hands go and how you put it in your backpack and such. You don't want to accidentally turn it off or on. Three simple buttons, nothing entirely major that will ruin your computer. Setting up is a breeze and extremely simple. No problems so far, will update in the future if any complications arise.

  I didn't want to spend a lot of time researching what to get to replace my 3 yr old Asus laptop so I just decided to get another Asus having had good customer experience with them.  As many reviewers noted it is a good bang for the buck plus I like the touch screen and the flip top and I had no need for a DVD player.  Through no fault of ASUS it comes with Windows 8.1.  After 3 tutorials and 30 minutes playing with it  I decided to download classicshell.net and my problems were over.  There is something sinister about the in your face 8.1 METRO app screen, I didn't want any of this crap, and scrolling through 4 windows to try to find the programs I had installed myself on the program screen on top of the pre-intalled 8.1 programs (most of which I deleted) was a nightmare, even with the touch screen.  Classic Shell replaces the 8.1 user interface with your choice of previous Windows UIs.  I selected XP because of the cascading start menu programs, which makes things easier to find than the 7.0 UI.  I was able to block, hopefully forever, the METRO screen where I will not be purchasing anything.  Good luck to those of you who keep the 8.1 UI, especially when you to try to figure out how to turn the computer off.  My understanding is that ASUS comes with a lot less bloatware than other brands, another reason I purchased ASUS.  The machine works very nicely.UPDATE:  Still happy with purchase.  As some other reviewers have noted, it does not have much wifi range.  I need to be  quite close to the router.

  I have the ASUS Flip 15.6-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop (Core i7, 1TB HDD, 8GB RAM).  I can agree with a lot of reviewers on here that the touch screen is horrible.  It doesn't recognize when I try and switch tabs in Google Chrome nor IE.  I have tried to calibrate the touch screen over and over and it has done very little good. I have even tried using the pen to select things with no luck. It also doesn't seem to work when I try and use the touch screen to do simple things like open emails or apps. You can see the square touch selector (which shows when/where you are touching) and it constantly shows touches being nowhere near my actual finger.  Not sure if I have a lemon or if this is just the horrible Asus touch screen that others complain about as well.  This is extremely irritating and exhausting.So, using this in tablet mode is pretty much a waste.  I put it in tablet mode and I can't get the touch screen to work.  I wish I had not purchased this at all.  It just does not perform very well at all.  I also had the misfortune of having this laptop freeze up on a Windows update.  I had to jump through a lot of hoops to fix it.So far I am not impressed and will probably not bother to purchase any more Asus computers.  Just to be clear, I after purchasing this one I now have 3 Asus laptops and none of them impress thus far.  The other two do not have touch screens so I don't have to complain about that.  But, these laptops just do not perform very well.

  I held out a long time before landing on this laptop--kept bouncing between HP and Dell models until this showed up quite unexpectedly and then got snatched up quickly.  I jumped on it at a very attractive price for the infrastructure I wanted that this had: latest I7 chip, 16 GB RAM, 512 SSD. Plus I wanted as many USB ports as possible along with a Thunderbolt port; never could find an HP (my previous laptops brand) or Dell with the right mix.  A really nice plus is the function key that can deactivate the touch pad--I use a mouse and sometimes accidentally hitting the touch pad can be a problem.  Finally, I liked the Indie Black color.  I'm not a gamer so can't comment on how this model handles those requirements.

  I love the touch screen and lighted keyboard. It's super fast compared to my old Toshiba. I expected getting everything up and running would be a hassle but it all went really smoothly. Only one glitch so far - the power switch is on the left side right where I grip when I'm shifting positions or picking it up to walk to another room so I've turned it off mid-whatever I'm doing a few times. It's a quick restart, though, so not a huge problem. I'm very pleased.

  I purchased this laptop to use at university, but I've found it to be very enjoyable overall. This is a 2 in 1, but unlike some others that I've looked at, I didn't have to sacrifice productivity for this functionality, although it does command a slight premium over it's competitors.Pros-The thermals on this machine are fantastic, without the need for an obnoxious fan. The Intel core i5 (8265) delivers power when needed but base clocks much lower than its peak, which allows the thermal profile to remain in check. After regular use for the last few months I've rarely seen it go above 45¬∞C, although it can under load.The M.2 SSD allows for lightning fast loading of files or data, and the seamless integration to the cloud with OneDrive will make you feel like your machine has much more space than what is physically on the drive. Solid construction including metal hinges make this a durable machine, and looks good doing it.The battery life is quite long, about 5 hours at full screen brightness with the backlit keyboard, and if you do not need the backlight, and are willing to turn down the screen and mute the speakers, you can squeeze almost 10 hours out of her, which is phenomenal.Cons-The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth share a card, which means using them simultaneously causes problems on the system. This is really only noticeable if you're doing something that requires a steady connection, but don't expect to make Skype calls with your Bluetooth headset on this machine. It does have a multi-jack, but sadly no Ethernet port, so this remains an issue that updating the drivers just won't solve.It may seem a little unfair but Windows 10 remains a big drawback of this machine. In the two months that I've had it, Windows 10 has pushed about 5 updates to the machine that have broken the Cortana search functionality and caused other system instabilities, including breaking Norton Antivirus and interfering with my VPN software. Whilst this is not ASUS' fault, it remains a con that any purchaser of the machine should be aware of: Windows 10 continues to have a haphazard update rollout that can and will break your software and driver functionality.Conclusion-Overall, it's the little things that ASUS includes that make this laptop worth purchasing, in my opinion. The included number pad is a great feature. When the screen is open, the bottom of the bezel has rubber pads that are designed to slightly lift the keyboard tray providing both an ergonomic angle, and providing ventilation to the logic board. The Windows Hello camera at the top has IR sensors so that the feature works in the dark. The onboard MicroSD card slot takes up less space and saves one the trouble of having to find clumsy adapters. The USB-C and HDMI outs make it easy to hook up to a monitor or TV when at home. Overall, I'd give this one a firm buy recommendation!

  Pros:- One of the best quality screens I have seen on a laptop.  Touch capability is also quick and fast.  Really outstanding.- The keyboard is one of the best out there, really, really comfortable to use for moderately heavy typing load.  Legibility is improved by using the F7 key to turn keyboard lighting up to a higher level than default.- My unit tested out with an overall Passmark score of 2,345, ranking it in the top 20 of the 200 plus tested machines with the Intel i5-8265UC chip that is in this laptop.  Really a quality set of components Asus has assembled in this close to budget priced laptop (a real sleeper model in the Asus lineup, often available for around $700).- Browsing, email and Office apps all work smoothly and fast.  Do not miss the GPU, but not a gamer either.- 360 degree hinges work well, and look very robust.- Top appears to be aluminum, base plastic, build quality overall high.Cons:- You can pay $500 more to lose a pound, but there is no free lunch, at 4.2lbs this laptop is probably not the best backpack laptop.  We use it almost exclusively at home, so not a problem.- Modest number of ports, check carefully to make sure you have what you need before purchase.- Battery life is mediocre when streaming video on wifi, will barely last 3 hours.- Screen max brightness might not be high enough if direct sunlight is on the screen.- Built in webcam is mediocre at best. The only thing that I am really disappointed in with all the video calls we are doing lately.  About the same PQ as my 8 year old Acer laptop camera that this replaced.  Says it is 720P, but looks strictly VGA to me.- More of a Windows con, but really Bill, two solid hours of updates to get a usable Windows machine....

  What a great laptop for its built quality and performance. But you need to tweak a few things to maximise gaming performance:- Purchase another 8GB memory for dual channel- Set UMA buffer size to be auto in BIOS (this gives 2GB video memory in case it needs). You can use 512M if you want.- In GeForce control panel, use GTX for both 3D settings and PhysX.- In power options, set everything to be max performance for both battery and AC (3 options in total).- Install latest AMD and GTX drivers, and upgrade to Windows 1903 latest update that resolved a power option related bug that can limit CPU performance.Enjoy the awesome laptop from ASUS.

  Overall a terrific value for a gaming laptop. The GTX 1650 4Gb video card runs just a tad slower than a GTX 1060. Amd Ryzen 5 processor with 4-core is ample for gaming and HD editing in Premiere Pro. 8Gb of ram wasn‚Äôt enough for my apps, so I ordered an additional 8Gb stick for the available slot. See photos for model number of the Samsung stick. The case is light yet stiff plastic, keyboard and trackpad are not bad. I‚Äôve had more expensive laptops with worse. 2nd 2.5 hard drive bay for expanded storage. The standout spec is the 120hz display, overall it looks great for gaming and editing. Some might pick on its color specs, nits, however ASUS includes a nice app to adjust to your liking. Overall wish I would have found this sooner, I‚Äôve wanted a mobile gamer and light editing system for travel. This fits perfectly for my on the go needs.

  This is absolutely the best laptop I've ever bought. I've played many games on it and even did a few benchmarks. On the benchmark, I scored 43% in gaming, 69% in desktop (EDIT: I got the benchmark to hit 80% in desktop!) (NEWEST EDIT: I got it to hit 82% in desktop!!), and 45% in workstation using UserBenchmark program on EZOC (turbo). In room temperatures, it stays relatively cool. I played Overwatch recently, and the GPU tempurature orbitid 70¬∞C. This is no means the best and most powerful laptop, but all the games I played were well above 60fps.Pros:1. build quality is superb2. Stays cool in room tempuratures3. Display is incredibly clear and fast4. SSD boot took 13 seconds5. Multi tasking handles really wellCons:1. When it first arrived, I had to reinstall Windows because the laptop kept freezing.2. It's not a big deal, but I would of liked to have an Nvidia sticker on the laptop. It just doesn't feel right without it.All around, great laptop! Go with AMD all the way, you cannot beet the performance for the price!

  I gotten the Gtx 1650|256 SSD|Ryzen 5 3550H Version I gotta say It's a very good price to performances considering it's a laptop that's not breaking the bank too much. The GTX 1650 is a Good budget card to play all the latest games in Medium-High settings in 1080p. I'm quite surprised that they kept the price this low considering you get a 1080p 120Hz Screen,Rbg keyboard,GTX1650, and a Ryzen Processor. A couple of things I dislike is the storage it's only 256gb that's not gonna cut, most likely you're gonna have to buy an HDD or another SSD and also the mousepad isn't that great but it works and also the speakers aren't that amazing so don't expect great audio lastly the battery life isn't that great don't expect to gaming for more than 2-3 hours.

  This laptop arrived on my doorstep on February 9th, 2020 and had no issues out of the box. I plugged it into my monitor, plugged a keyboard and mouse in, and downloaded the Resident Evil 2 remake. This laptop will run the game on high settings, however the fans will be very loud and the CPU will be working very hard. I just want to mention this as a sort of rough benchmark, though we'll get into more specifics in just a minute.First, let's look at the pro's and con's of this laptop. Now, just to get a subjective opinion out of the way, I do not take my laptop out of the house very often. That being said, there's no reason why I wouldn't. It weighs roughly 5 pounds which doesn't really seem too heavy to me, but obviously you be your own judge.Pro's:* Has played everything I've thrown at it* Apparently can run Linux (I run Linux, you can run whatever you want)* The keyboard is I believe a chiclet keyboard, but honestly it's one of the best feeling chiclet keyboards I've used in recent memory* The screen has a solid 120 hertz refresh rate and some pretty decent viewing angles for the price. I will say that there are some bright spots, which might bug some people, but I don't mind them so much.* Build quality is something I look for in all of my laptops, and this one was obviously no exception. The body is all plastic, but it's a solid feeling plastic that's kind of rigid and doesn't flex much but also doesn't feel brittle.* The hinge is actually also very sturdy. I did not think this would be the case, and worried about the amount of closing/opening it would have to endure. After a few months, I'm happy to report that it feels no different than when I first bought it. Again, only 2 months at this point, but I've had more expensive laptops break in less time. I'll call it a positive.Con's:* Look, the touchpad just sucks. If you plan on using this touchpad for any kind of serious work, just get a mouse. It's finicky, often deciding that I have a ghost finger touching in the opposite place as my finger, or that the three clicks I just did were all right clicks. Frankly, it's kind of a headache, but I mean a mouse is better anyway.* The battery life is pretty mediocre for a normal, business class laptop and downright abysmal when you're gaming. Think 2 hours of Resident Evil before you have to think about how much progress you're going to lose in the next 15-20 minutes. Leave it plugged in for intense gaming, surfing the web and watching youtube will get you about 4-5 hours, depending on your settings.* This laptop only comes with the 256gb nvme flash memory. This is great as a boot drive and pretty much nothing else. It does not come with a hard drive by traditional standards, and the space provided is not enough for any kind of gaming library. You'll likely want to get a 1tb hard drive or SSD, that should hold most of your stuff. Or get a different size, I'm not your mom.* I/O is not great. All of the ports on this laptop are on the left hand side of the laptop, meaning that there are not very many of them, and yet they still feel kind of cramped. In total, there are three usb ports (1 of which is USB 2.0, the other two are USB 3.0) an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, the charging port, and a headphone jack. There is no card reader, no thunderbolt, no USB-c. On the other side of the laptop you'll find a kensington lock, for all of your kensington purposes. I just kind of feel like they could have put in a card reader and maybe another USB or HDMI on the other side, but it doesn't bug me too much.* Finally, and this is more a gripe about the current state of windows as a whole, but this laptop does come with a fair amount of bloatware. I randomly find things like Bejewelled or Fruit Ninja and their lookalikes downloaded on my boot drive. Thank Linus for Linux, yikes.Now something that I do want to address, this CPU (Ryzen 5 R5-3550h with Vega 8 IGPU) is not the toughest CPU out there. It's comparable to some of the low end i5's that Intel has been putting out, but it does only have a base clock speed of 2.1 GHZ and a boosted clock speed of 3.7 GHZ. This means that the CPU does sometimes get very hot for what seems like lower quality games, but the reality is that those games may be more CPU intensive. A good example I found was Terraria. It runs fine, but not when I was doing five other things in the background. Just some food for thought, it hasn't really impacted my feeling about this laptop, but you should know what you're getting before you get it.Finally, I want to mention the Armoury Crate program that is shipped with ROG and TUF laptops from Asus. I personally really like the interface, and it's one of few thing's I'll miss when I switch to Linux. It really does give you all of the real time performance info you need, as well as allowing you to control certain effects for your keyboard or what GPU will be used. You can also buy devices that link to your laptop and use the same RGB effects (For all you REAL gamers out there.)To sum this whole thing up, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't really expecting the build quality to be great, I wasn't expecting a really good keyboard, and I wasn't really expecting to be able to throw Linux on here. Lots of good surprises, not many bad ones. The touchpad sucks, but this IS still a budget laptop. I would and have recommended this laptop to friends and family alike, and am excited to see how long I can run modern titles with this lovely machine. I don't want to say ""Get this NOW!!!!"" or anything, but I did a lot of shopping and found nothing better for the price, so take that how you want to.Thanks for reading! If you've made it this far, have a great rest of your day!Update 10/20/2020: Everything that I previously said has remained the same. Keyboard is great, still handles all of my games, and I've grown my library quite a bit since then. I really don't have much more to add to my previous review, I just felt it was good to update this review and let anyone know that the laptop has not disappointed thus far. I do have mine in more of a second screen, desktop configuration, But the ventilation had been fantastic even when I had it on my bed playing some low resource games. All in all, I can comfortably recommend this laptop to others after over 6 months.

  after a month of research and tech support, returned item.  Could not get the microphone (internal or external) to pick up enough sound to be heard after recording (only faintly if turned up all the way).Otherwise, compared to previous laptops, processing speed was notably faster.  Screen was duller/dimmer.  Speakers were a bit hollow ( I often wondered if upgrading to Harmon Kardon really did anything -- now I know it does).I would get this again if it had a working mic.

  For the specs you get with this computer it is well worth the price.The display (when it works right) is amazing and can be just as vivid as you want it to be. Movies look good, programs look good, pictures look good, etc. The display is the one issue I've had though and I'll explain later.The speed is amazing and haven't seen a hick up there so far even when running some more advanced programs through VPN.I love the number touchpad, however since you have to look at it it's hard to really use the way I want to. It speeds things up if you're typing numerous numbers, but isn't the same as a physical keyboard and could be more time consuming that just using the numbers above the letter keys.It does have a backlit keyboard and it took me a minute to find (F7). You can even adjust the brightness and this is a really good feature.Screenshots are a breeze using the F11 key.Microsoft has made some good changes to their apps like Mail, OneDrive, and Your Phone that help keeps things more seamless between the computer and phone.The weight and size are perfect for what I need and I couldn't be happier with that.The titled keyboard is nice although the edges are sharp and can grab at your pants.Overall I'm happy with the computer itself, but have been disappointed in one thing...CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE!ASUS Does not have a phone number to call so everything is communicated through chat or email and takes days to get a resolution. I've had trouble with a program being incompatible and it caused a lot of screen flicker. They offered no help other than for me to ship my computer to them and be without for over a week. I wound up uninstalling the program and that fixed it, but frustrated that I couldn't get more help. I also updated numerous graphic drivers, factory reset twice, and uninstalled everything that may have caused it.Secondly, a grid started showing up randomly on the screen and would lock there for about 1-2 minutes and then it would go back to normal. Once again the only resolution they offered was to mail it into them and be without for a week. Not something I was ready to do for a minor inconvenience, but I feel like I'm holding a ticking time bomb and need to find a week I don't need it before the warranty expires. Either could've been a graphics driver problem or Windows 10 issue, but the fact that Asus wouldn't give a little more help or better resolutions was very frustrating.

  Wow!! Another awesome machine from Asus. I've been an Asus fan for over 15 years. This elegant device really blows my mind. I was actually surprised to see that the touch pad is a screen with apps on it!!!! Besides the numeric pad, it comes with a few handy apps. Very fast, elegant, light, don't know how long the battery lasts yet, but I've played with it about half day and the battery was about 55% still. Comes with a nice sleeve, but I ordered an extra one just in case. I got this for my business, being portable small and light, it will definitely fulfill my expectations. Awesome job Asus, once again! Thank you!!

  The ASUS ZenBook UX325JA-DB71 is one helluva laptop.  After owning MacBooks, XPS 13's, I can honestly say the Asus Zenbook is right up there with the best.  The build quality is good and the notebook has a premium feel to it. without breaking the bank.  I had the i7 with 512gb sdd.-Fan was quiet and didn't turn on much but I am just a casual user. No heavy tasks, programs, or games.-Battery life is good.-Keyboard is excellent-perfect amount of travel.-speakers are pretty good but not great.-Screen was vibrant and clear although it could be a tad brighter.-Trackpad was smooth and accurate-number pad works well too.Unfortunately, I will be returning the Asus. When I peeled off the stickers on the palm rest, the right side has a fairly large sticker highlighting some features left a permanent residue. It's not leftover glue or sticky residue that can wipe off.I don't know what happened but a visible square shape where the sticker was is really visible.  Not cool for  $900 laptop.  It will not go away after many attempts.Overall I think I was just unlucky but I don't want t risk it with a replacement and waste time and resources. I  still recommend this machine just make sure you don't have the same permanent stain/residue after you remove the stickers.Great Job Asus!

  As a programmer and an avid laptop user I hope I can give a well detailed reviewPros- Top of the list is the screen clarity which I have to say hands down is one of the best. It will definitely help you out day, night, outside anywhere- battery is pretty amazing. It gives a solid 9-10 hours on normal streaming and light programming- mettalic chassis finish which is bound to attract a few eyes and that premium feel- not going to tell much about the ram, ssd or processor as they are in my opinion already understood and the zenbook works amazing as I haven't faced a single lag or stutter in the least- IR face unlock is definitely amazing with a 2-3 sec guaranteed unlock- keyboard is well put along with the asus lift technology and the number pad on touchpad though of no use to me is still a good feature to have.Cons- it's sound is amazing for a zenbook and the voice clarity is top notch,but it lacks in base which is understood as it's a zenbook- though the metallic finish is of premium essence, it can lead to finger print stains so must be used with care to that.

  I love the laptop in general, however since recieving it,I have been having problems with how it functions and want a replacement please.The laptop literally flickered for 20 minutes before and after restarting it.Not only did it flickered but as I was typing my essay for an assignment it shut off automatically and the battery was still at 57%.I was on my seventh paragraph and had not saved what was written.I love the laptop but these early signs of it malfunctioning like this is not good.I would gladly appreciate a replacement to whom it may concern.Thank you in advance.

  This is the worst functioning lap top I have ever owned.  Right from day one the system would randomly shut down and go to the famous ""blue Screen"" that nobody likes to see.  After dealing with this countless times I finally sent it in for repair while under warranty.  The lap top was returned to me and they replaced the SSD.  Two months later, same thing....Nothing but problems.  Sent the computer again to Asus for repair and now they diagnosed the computer as ""System Hang up"".  They reloaded the operating system....So once agani I have to set my computer back up to the way it was before the repairs and now, another 10 months later and I am having the same damn problem, only this time it is worse.  I was getting blue screens, random freezing of computer, and random shut downs.  Currently the computer does not even turn on. And now i am being told my lap top in no longer under warranty.  Asus built this computer and they never built it correctly from day one and now after two attempts they still have not made it operate as it should.  Completely dissatisfied and frustrated with Asus...PS I own another Asus product, the T100HA and surprise....It randomly freezes up and shuts down!!!  I think i am done with ASUS for good now.

  Love it - I love Windows 8 and the form factor of this laptop.  There's lots of reviews of both but my favorite aspects of the Asus is the aluminum chassis which feels solid and rich and keeps it cool.  The track pad is huge and sensitive. The keyboard also has a nice feel.

  The solid state hard drive crashed after 6 months of use. I had to spend $500 to Geeksquad to retrieve the data and another $500 to get it repaired through Asus. A week after the repair my laptop wont start again. I have to send it in for yet another repair.

  I had an older version of this system for work, and bought my own recently.  The design is beautiful, approaching perfection for an Ultrabook.  Unfortunately, a week or so into use, the system began to crash and reboot sporadically.  It would also not wake up from sleep properly, or crash when going into sleep mode, reboot into the BIOS and run hot in your laptop bag.  Occasionally it would freeze when waking up from sleep or hibernate.  I tried numerous things to fix it, and eventually gave up--not worth it.For this price, I don't want to hack around with instability issues.  Very disappointed as the Ultrabook is otherwise excellent.

  As a straight purchase, upgrade to the SSD version as the HD version performs poorly with a lot of lag just the Win10 environment.  Lag was down right annoying in applications.The Bad:I had purchased this based on the empty m.2 SSD slot for an extra drive; however, the m.2 slot is not supported with the BIOS that ASUS has loaded on the MB.  When I contact ASUS, I got mixed results.  But when it was clear to them I was wanting to use the m.2 slot, it became all 'please use a professional certified upgrader', etc.  Further help was cut off.  This is why I'm docking 2-stars.Based on tips online and some off-the-script guidance from ASUS, I tried reinstalling Win10 on the HD with no noticable improvment. Ultimately ended up installing a 2.5"" SSD and reinstalling Win10 as it was past the return period and all the troubleshooting I had done pretty much blocked a return anyways.The Good:Empty memory slot makes it easy to double RAM to 16GB. And I had no issues with RAM upgrade.ASUS support was good on helping with a track pad issue (BIOS update) and which 2.5"" SSD's could be installed.With the new 2.5"" SSD and Win10 freshly installed, this is a great laptop.  Lag begone!  No lag issues in O365, and I am even running Lightroom without issues.  Battery life is good.  Web-browsing and O365 apps seem to get 4-6 hours per charge.  LR burned through a charge in <2 hours, but it's LR, right?  No issues with heat build up.  Unit runs cool, even in LR.  I am going to try loading up a few games to see how they run.This unit is not bulky due to the thin bezel around the screen.  It feels more like a 14"" computer, but the screen view is 'huge'.  The graphics look  nice for a laptop and definitely top-notch in this price range.  The case feels a little flimsy.  Opening things up, it is clear there is not much stiffening material in the case/shell.  But I am not hard on my electronics (I don't expect them to survive a two-story drop unharmed).  I do not expect to have issues beyond normal wear.  The weight is light enought that I would compare it to the Mac Airbook it is replacing (yes, I went Apple for a bit, but I'm back folks!).  The small charger unit is a bonus too.  This will not take up much room in any bag.Final Word:OK, master plan to get a powerhouse laptop for less than $1000 was not totally realized.  But with the SSD and a stick of memory, this is a great iCore7 laptop for the money.  Advice to potential buyers: go ahead and get the SSD version.

  This laptop is was so cool. I was able to multi task while working online as an ESL teacher. I can run a lot of application and it responded really fast. It can also get the highest internet connection from the broadband. It is really lightweight and the sound it was loud, louder than my old hp notebook.It was more than what I was expecting for. It even has an automatic installment of windows and there was like a bot that recognizes my voice the first to help me with the installation of the windows. I thought its gonna be hard to use the windows 10 but I was mistaken. It can also sustain a gameplay especially in LoL.One thing that disappointed me was the longetivity of the battery which was stated like ""8h battery life (full working day)"" but the charge is only lasting for 4hrs. NOTE: The battery is not detachable.By the way, I appreciated amazon in giving back the express fee I spent for this, since it had a delay in the delivery.

  Worked great for a while.  I paid an extra $100 to upgrade to Windows Professional.  But there is a loose connecton which now causes the video to flicker and go black!  Disappointed!  Also, as other have mentioned, the WiFi is horrible.  It takes a while to con next when waking up or booting.  Unacceptable!  Also, the hdmi and vga ports are too close together to run dual monitors, but I did manage to get it working by using a Dremel to cut the post off my video cable.  If not for these problems I would be happy with performance, but the video flicker is the worst thing ever!

  This laptop exceeded my expectations. It is very light weight. I have carried it in my camera bag and did not even realize it was there. It is very fast. I can do Lightroom and Photoshop editing on it with ease. The 1 TB hard drive is plenty roomy. I have all 12,000 of my digital photos on it with plenty of room to spare. I only wish it had an SSD, but I can always add one later.I probably use this laptop 10-12 hours a day, every day and I have not had the first problem with it.

  I bought this laptop for my wife.  Should have spent more to get one that was decent.The first one I got was so painfully slow that I returned it and they sent me another one.  Slightly better and she was willing to tolerate it, so... whatever.She got a little over two years out of that one before it stopped charging.  I don't mean you have to plug it into the wall while you use it.  I mean you cannot turn it on because there is not any power.Fortunately I know a thing or two about computers.  I'm going to get another laptop, pull the hard drive out of this one and recover all of her lost files because she doesn't back her stuff up.  (A whole other issue, but don't get me started on that one).Lesson learned.  Don't buy the garbage.Here's the thing that kills me.  Asus makes some good products.  I'm typing this on an Asus monitor that I absolutely love.  I'm running an Ubuntu server with 5 hard drives that is over 8 years old with no issues.  I like their products, just NOT THIS ONE!

  Bought this laptop a few months ago for telework purposes and am a bit disappointed by the battery life. I find myself having to recharge every 4-5 hours. The mouse trackpad is also extremely sensitive and ""fussy"" at times. I would recommend connecting a bluetooth or usb mouse.

  I use this laptop a lot, everyday and overall it's a good product: it's light, the battery has a decent life, it charges rather quickly and the screen quality is good. The one big complaint I have is the touchpad: it never works properly, either not responsive or when it is, it's all over the place. It was defective when I received it, I tried to have it replaced or fixed but Amazon refused and since I can't work without a computer, I didn't have another option but to keep it.After trying soooo many different updates/repairs, nothing worked and I ended up buying a mouse. It works fine with the mouse, however a brand new $700 laptop should have a working pad.

  ¬†Bought this from a friend's Amazon account. I'm not sure how to put it. The supposedly labeled ""dreamy white"" is just a laptop with a completely white color. It reflects to a pink-purpish color under artifical light and it reflects alot more under the sun. The thing is I will be staying indoor most of the time, so me or others around me won't be able to see its true color unless we're out under a sunny day. It's a light weight laptop and I love the design. I just got received it today,  so I will be trying out its functions in the upcoming weeks. (It's not a touchscreen laptop (in case you're wondering!)) Their is the promised backlit keyboard, but it's not as bright as I thought it would be. Still pretty cool looking!

  The Good:SpeedThe Okay:The pen/stylusThe Bad-ish:UpdatesMaybe it has just been a while since I have bought a Windows laptop (Chromebook user since 2014), but I figured that everything would be perfect and ready to go right out of the box.  Sure there were the typical updates the first day; I checked the Windows updates and got everything the first day, restarted, everything was great.  On the second day, I had Chrome and Zoom open and the screen started to go in and out of focus, blurring and sharpening, off and on, non-stop.  I restarted the laptop and had no issues like that afterwards.  Amazon support said that it might have been a screen driver being updated or something.  I have never come across this issue with any previous laptops, but hopefully that is all that it was.  I will update this review if any other weird issues come up.The only thing that I could suggest for an improvement is the pen.  If there was a way to insert the pen into the laptop for safe-keeping, that would be ideal.  I do like that it sticks to the keyboard or lid when I do not need it... the next best thing I guess.  The performance of the pen is okay.  I am unable to just place the tip on the screen and slide it; I have to put a bit of pressure in order for the screen to recognize that I want to draw or click something.One thing that the laptop does well is speed.  The SSD and Windows Hello allows it to start up and log in about 5 seconds.  Overall a great laptop.  Thanks for reading

  This listing needs a review for the OLED model. I NEVER write reviews. But I wish I had a review like this before I purchased. So here we go....This laptop is amazing. Build quality is fantastic. This is my first ASUS and its incredible.Here are things I like and do not likeLikes1) OLED Screen is AMAZING (no comparison to LCD screens)2) Build quality is FANTASTIC.3) Track pad is best I have ever used. It can be used as hard clicks or soft touches like an apple one.4) I LOVE the keyboard. Some people might not like it, but I love it that its squishy. Not hard like apple or other keyboards lately.5) Mega thin6) charging cable is not massive brick and it's one piece instead of two pieces that connect to each other7) case it comes with is nice and professional (although seems a touch too big, provably shared with 14's)8) sound is surprisingly great even though I never use the speakers. Really impressed .Dislikes1) I hate windows, I wish there was an alternative. I would have purchased a macbook if they had OLED. Windows system is just trash. Constant multi gigabyte updates. Why?2) 13.3 inches is the new size, but I prefer 14. It's a perfect medium between 13 and 15.3) ***** The keyboard backlight in the dark is WAYYYYYYY too bright for me. This was almost a deal killer for me. Yes it can be turned down but even lowest setting is bright AF.There were so many bad reviews about this laptop, but I think they might be all scams from other companies trying to lure business away. This laptop is premium. Way better than a macbook imo.Here is the deal tho.... I only bought this because I wanted an OLED for work. I think they are just easier on my eyes for everyday use. The model I got was the Intel i5. If I was going to get this for my personal computer I probably would have gotten the Flip S, which is the same computer but with a 4k screen and i7 chip (and cool black and gold accents). But the price is $500 more.I do not run editing programs or anything requiring alot of computational power, so I do not have any speed problems. If you are going to do that or gaming, go with the i7.But since this is just for work, this computer was perfect, and I might go as far to say it's my favorite computer I've ever owned.The fan gets loud but only when it's doing something like a windows update and it only lasts for a few seconds. The computer is WHISPER quiet for 99.9% of the time I do work. If you hear the fan thats just downloading something in background bc windows sucks.I really like this computer and it fit my needs perfectly. So portable to travel.If you are doing simple tasks then i5 OLED is a steal. If you need video editing or gaming go with the flip S.Hope this helps. ASUS was ranked the most durable of all computers and after I saw how Amazon packaged my box (HORRIBLE), I was happy that ASUS had that military grade drop test sticker on it.Buy this in peace knowing you will get an amazing laptop.Also batter runs me all work day no problem.****UPDATE*****Almost 30 days in and it is the best computer that I have ever owned. I just absolutely love it.Also the keyboard backlighting is not as bad as I had originally perceived. I think it's just the function keys where lights bleeds out so much. That is my only gripe with computer (which is nothing really to gripe about). Just an amazing machine.

  Lee bien mis comentarios antes de comprar este equipo ( ASUS ZenBook Flip 13 Ultra Slim Convertible Laptop, Pantalla t√°ctil OLED FHD de 13,3"", I5 8GB ram 512 Gb)Que me gusta?1.- Es ligera, no pesa mucho2.- La pantalla tiene muy buena resoluci√≥n y buen brillo3.- Es r√°pida , esto me imagino que es por sus procesadores, la utilizo para trabajos en casa que tampoco son muy pesados , abrir documentos etc, . no edito videos ni juego.4.- El teclado es bastante c√≥modo, suave y hay buena separaci√≥n entre la teclas.5.- El pad mouse es bien sensible y c√≥modo,  es muy √∫til los n√∫meros en el pad mouse si necesitas sacar de vez en cuando la calculadora, en mi caso no lo he utilizado mucho pero es una buena herramienta.6.- El sonido de sus cornetas es muy respetable, claro no vas a animar una fiesta con este port√°til, pero se oyen muy bien (fuerte y claro).7.-El l√°piz t√°ctil es muy bueno creo que un poco rustico pero es muy bueno hace su trabajo lo malo te lo voy a decir en lo que no me gusta, pero a nivel general escribe y dibuja bien.8.- La bater√≠a es decente la cargue una sola vez y tengo dos d√≠as utiliz√°ndola y me dice que tiene aun 47% y que me durara 6h 8m al momento de realizar estos comentarios.9.- El reconocimiento facial es super r√°pido por eso tiene su certificaci√≥n Pantone.Que NO me gusta?1.- Lo principal que no me gusta y si viviera en Estados Unidos la devolver√≠a es que su relacion cuerpo pantalla es muy pobre, a pesar de que tiene pantalla Oled al compararla con mi Microsoft Surface pro 4 quede muy decepcionado al ver mi foto de inicio de pantalla y verla un poco achatada no se como explicarte que la foto no se ve igual , Asus se concentro en poner su marca en el borde inferior restando amplitud a la pantalla y esto perjudica la visualizaci√≥n de la presentaci√≥n de tu pantalla, no entiendo para que le ponen una pantalla Oled si no le van a dar todo el beneficio que trae esa tecnolog√≠a, en fin no me gusto.2.- Cuando le√≠a los comentarios de otras personas no le hice mucho caso a lo del calentamiento, pero se√±ores es cierto, si usted la tiene en sus piernas y con el cargador conectado calienta much√≠simo y enciende los ventiladores que se escuchan un poco pero nada del otro mundo tampoco es algo insostenible, pero si calienta, ahora bien , en estos momentos estoy escribiendo desde mi cama y la tengo en mis piernas y no se siente mucho el calor, es m√≠nimo as√≠ que es cuando esta enchufada, se los digo porque me asuste pens√© que se iba a quemar jajajaja. Y me imagino tambi√©n que en ese momento como estaba conectada al toma corriente y bajo esas condiciones la desconecte y la puse en modo tableta y de verdad que estaba caliente y le duro un buen rato, insisto en modo tableta la pantalla y el calor no me gustaron y porque vivo en Venezuela no la puedo devolver tan f√°cilmente. As√≠ que espero me traiga otras satisfacciones porque hasta ahora le doy un 3.5 de calificaci√≥n, y ojo no es por el precio porque hubiera preferido poner un poco mas y me compraba la Dell xps, claro el Stylus es mas costoso y seguramente tampoco tiene donde colocarlo jajaja.....pero bueno hasta ahora es lo que percibo.3.- El L√°piz (Stylus), que mala jugada la de Asus que no supo donde colocarlo, pareciera que lo echaron en la caja por salir del paso, de verdad que en ning√∫n sitio que colocan ellos en su promoci√≥n es factible y c√≥modo porque se cae as√≠ que te digo que tienes que cuidarlo mucho, ni siquiera trajo un clip para ponerlo en mi camisa pero bueno Asus tenia que abaratar los costos.Por los momentos es lo que percibo, quiz√°s mas adelante cambie de opini√≥n no lo se , pero de ser as√≠ seguro se los hare saber....suerte

  During the set up process the keyboard locked up. Thinking I might have hit something wrong, I worked with it for a couple days, nothing worked. Tried to contact the seller through Amazon's message system and got no responce. Tried to contact the seller by phone, got no answer. Now it looks like I'm going to have to go through a huge hassle to return this product. I don't like giving bad reviews, but I am a disabled veteran on a limited income and cannot afford to spend this kind of money only to have a product fail right out of the box.Update: The laptop reset itself and I got it working. It has been a wonderful laptop since. I'm not giving 5 stars because their customer service is horrible.

  Bought as gift for my son. He absolutely loves it.  He does say the camera quiches out sometimes but overall he is truly happy. Looking at purchasing another one asus brand laptops or 2 for the rest of household.Editing to add additional info, ASUS sent an email stating I could receive a warranty extension for submitting a review.

  Works well but I wish it didn't use the rare 6.0√ó3.7mm jack and the lack of usb-c supplemental power makes it fairly limited in portability and the fans have poor intake design relegating it to desktop use

  I bought this laptop for my daughter who graduated high school and it was greatly appreciated. She is into online gaming with friends and it is perfect. The screen quality is fabulous. Only reason it wasn‚Äôt 5 stars is because we had to call Asus help line as the keyboard had an update which we were not aware of and we‚Äôre not able to get it to work. They walked us through it all and is great now.

  Yo compre este portatil principalmente para edicion, hasta el dia de Hoy me ha ido muy bien con el.El portatil tiene 3 Modos: Silencioso, Equilibrado y Turbo, este ultimo se obtiene conectado el cargador.En cuanto al modo silenciosos y Equilibrado en Edicion de video, el rendimiento podria mejorar, sin embargo con el modo turbo se aprovecha muchisimo mejor todos los componentes de la Portatil, esto tambien aplicaria para juegos, van super fluidos.En cuanto a su bateria, este portatil no esta dise√±ado para estar desconectado del cargador mucho tiempo, ya que solo dura unas 2 horas sin conexion y luego hay que cargarlo de nuevo, siendo un producto Gamer es normal que no este dise√±ado para esto ya que los juegos hoy en dia necesitan de muchos recursos, la mejor forma de disfrutar de el es estando en la mesa y tenerlo conectado.El portatil en general esta muy bien para tareas pesadas y estresantes de renderizado, muy recomendado.

  I needed a laptop for school, but i also enjoy gaming so i wanted something i could do both on without breaking over $1,000. I searched and researched for over 2 months looking at several different brands, why their good, versus another, why their bad. Whats equipped etc. and i came across this laptop. It was rocking 16 gigs of RAM, 1tb SSD, and a GTX 1650ti? All for this price tag? Too good to be true right? because EVERYTHING else was less for the same price. So i kept looking. I checked out the Lenovo Legion, the MSI, Dell, HP, Overpowered, and Acer. All great in their own way. But i wanted more bang for my buck. So i went back to this laptop. I chose it and pruchased it. It arrived a day early than what was initially stated and i booted it up for the first time. I went through the setup and boom, there i was at the desktop. I restarted the laptop to see how fast it was, what pre programs loaded up on startup (You know how alot of these have a buttload of programs all booting up when you turn on your pc and slows everything down) none of that happened. It was quick, back to the desktop. The laptop was open and free for me to install what i wanted without prompting me to use certain programs i didnt want. Which i loved. I had my classes to do that evening so i booted them up and the speed was WOW. No waiting at all. Everything loaded very quickly.I have to say, this laptop is the best bang for your buck you are going to find at this price range. Definitely worth it unless you just want to spend thousands of dollars on a laptop, in which case, why bother? Just build yourself a PC.

  Laptop fans can be loud in general, but this one is loud enough to be distracting and I can barely hear game audio over it. It's fine if you use noise canceling headphones, but I would probably be a nuisance if I took this to school or a coffee shop.The other issue is the track pad must be broken or something. Half the time it doesn't read my input so  it's super frustrating just trying to move the cursor. I ordered a wired mouse so hopefully I won't have to use it ever again.The connection/hinge between the screen and keyboard seems like it's just made of a cheap feeling plastic (same as the rest of the body), and it visibly flexes if you don't open it from the exact top-center of the screen.The built in webcam has a pretty low image quality, but I use a USB webcam anyways.I don't expect a whole lot from a laptop battery, but this is just so bad. I tried playing valheim without this laptop being plugged into the charger. Starting from 100% and with moderate graphics settings and no other programs open, the battery lasted less than an hour and the performance was laggy. Might as well get a desktop computer, this is useless off the charger.

  Like other reviewers, I shopped around for a new laptop for weeks before settling on this beauty. I was shopping to replace my 8 year old Samsung laptop that was starting to struggle with everyday tasks. The product description is accurate, this listing is upgraded with extra SSD space and RAM.I can't believe what a great laptop this is! The display is crisp and bright, setup was a breeze, and it's lightning fast with everything I ask it to do! I can play Guild Wars 2 (best MMO ever by the way!) at the highest graphics settings and this laptop handles it with ease, not even a hint of lag! I've been singing ""a whole new world"" to myself because it really is like an entirely new game on this thing!I agree with other reviewers about the quality of the speakers as well. I actually have to turn the volume down now so as not to disturb other people in my household, compared to my old laptop where I really struggled to hear when watching movies or youtube.As for the heat and fan, it's only noticeable when I run my game. I have the laptop on a raised cooling stand to help with airflow. I notice the heat above the keyboard but it's about the same amount of heat that my old laptop produced, nothing alarming that's going to burn your hand or anything. The fan is audible but honestly, it's not really a huge distraction for me. I can still hear my game or videos over it just fine.The shipping was very slow for me, but that wasn't the seller's fault. UPS had it out for delivery and then suddenly it wasn't, and then it was two states away, and I had to wait almost another week for it to make its way back to my state. I think it got put on the wrong truck by mistake or something. Regardless, it arrived safely and works perfectly!

  I wish the seller was more honest regarding the laptop. The specs are not what they say they are. Will edit my review once I find out specs from the laptop itself. But box was suspicious with a white sticker covering the specs.Edit*** so laptop is accurate. Box is wrong. They should have a disclaimer that they upgraded the computer themselves. Really enjoying the computer. Nothing bad to say. If you‚Äôre on the fence for a good gaming laptop, this one is the one.

  So the noise issue?  There's a lotta horsepower under the hood and as a result it takes some heavy duty cooling.  When I am running Ram intensive games..... 8-10 gig RAM instensive, the fan kicks and hums along exhausting the heat....it appears to be well designed, just wish the fan was a tad quieter (not a reason to lower the rating). It's super fast at booting up....less than 20 secs powering up to ready to go each and every time.  Screen resolution is amazing.  I play 4x games like Civ 6, so it's hard to compare my results with those of you out there that play graphic intensive games...you know who you are.  Because there's a lot of horsepower to make gaming quick and responsive.One last comment, the sound....WOW, they put in good sound compared to the previous 8 laptops I have owned since 1999.  You will be well please with the rich AUDIO....all for  under $870?  Forget about it !

  Well after watching a lot of review online about different 2in1 I decided to go with this one du to the fact it has a dedicated graphic card (from time to time i do video editing).First impression was great. Packaging ,design,a sleeve included, well a good start :)I boot the computer and damn it was fast ! 5 second and I was into windows 10. But as soon as I was on the desktop began windows update...Well sounds familiar,no ?Using this 2in1 everyday I have mixfeeling about itFor sure its fast and powerful and the sound quality  is good , the keyboard and screen are great, battery life so far is good (around 7 hours with light web browsing and watching some videos with brightness set to medium),  but we paid for this, no ? Where I am not so happy is with the comfort about using it. First I don't know why but on my screenshots folder I got pics about my welcome screen mix with my desktop that are taken without me doing anything. Why this is happening is beyond my understanding...I got the feeling is when I close the lid or open it but why its taking a pic its a fact I don't understand and like. Second well the trackpad from time to time is not responding in the way I'm expecting, a bit off I would say. Was much happier with my old one. About pluging an earphones from time to time its not working.It's like noting was plug in and well  its something very annoying....In that case I have to restart the computer of course...The sound also from time to time is cracking when I watch some video and also after a restart its fine. So there should be a problem (hardware, software,both ?) but its  simply really annoying. And also flipping the screen is a not a great experience. I had issues swapping from one mode to the other,  with the mouse and keyboard that went on when I was reading in tablet mode...Also the virtual Keyboard well sometimes doesn't show up when I need...And sometimes the screen has problem to just adjust in the right position becoming a bit crazy sometimes...Well I made a comparison with a friend of mine that as a cheap teclast 5 (300 dollars)and gosh it's much more friendly to use without these annoying bugs I experienced with my 1300 dollars Asus...He was also shocked about how my computer was reacting...He was maybe thinking its a defective product or some incompatibility with windows and their legendaries updates.....And a little thing is the micro sd slot let a very small part of the micro sd going out means if you put your 2in1 on the side it will disconnect the micro sd....Plus I have to buy 2 thing grip sticks to avoid the asus to slide on a flat surface because well its slippery....On the 300 teclast well the micro sd it fit completely inside and its stable.You expect these small nice features to be included in a more expensive laptop than in a 300 bucks 2in1...Well...So to conclude Its a powerful medium sized 2in1 that is unfortunately not a pleasure of using it everyday because of these annoying small issues I mentioned...It's like buying a nice car with plenty of nice option that are not working well, frustrating....Even with all these issue I like my asus and I would love it without all these smalls annoying issues....

  There is a lot to love about this laptop including a beautiful, crisp display and great functionality. Glad I opted for the 16gb ram. Really speeds up my processing time using Adobe Lightroom. I spent a lot of time looking at laptop specs and appreciate that this one has two USB-A and one USB-C ports as well as HDMI. I really misread the port specs however and thought this had a SD slot but it only has Micro-SD which is practically useless. There are no adapters that take SD down to Micro-Sd. Lots of adapters that take Micro-SD to SD however. Not sure what the engineers were thinking. Now I have another adapter to buy. If engineers can put two SD slots in my DSLR it would seem they can put one in a laptop.

  I'll answer the question that I posed (since Amazon won't allow me to answer my own question) about what's up with the USB-C port.  Turns out that it is good for data transfer (including USB 3.1 Gen 2...the really fast version), but can't be used as a HDMI out port, and can't work with the USB PD (for charging the laptop).  I'm not sure how much power it provides, but I just bought a USB-C to 10 port AC powered USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port replicator that has 3 fast charge ports, so I don't have to worry about it. Nice machine so far (brand new).  No complaints.  I'm hoping the extra cores and threads will speed my video editing.

  I use this laptop to submit reports from oilfield well sites. I usually work out of my vehicle so I was interested in the small size and long battery lift. I thought I would be using it in tablet mode - get the monitor out of the way. But I've found it's easier to just use it like a regular laptop. I also so some light gaming in my downtime. It's OK for light gaming, but if you are more serious about it you will need a faster graphics card.. The battery life is good. It easily lasts a 10-12 hr day for what I do (not continuous use). I also like the SSD because I don't have to worry about the drive heads bouncing around if I move my vehicle.The display is clear and bright enough that I can use it outdoors without difficulty - after I installed an anti-glare screen protector.I had problems with the Wi-Fi adaptor flashing a list of hotspots, then going blank. I tried getting the latest drivers off of the ASUS site but it didn't help. I finally went to the Intel site and those drivers fixed the problem.Their is no Ethernet port but my laptop came with a Ethernet to USB adaptor.The touchpad works well and sometimes I just use it, but I don't know all of the gestures for things like drag/drop so I prefer to use a mouse. Speaking of mice, two standard USB ports isn't a lot, especially if you want to use a mouse and the Ethernet adaptor. That leaves how many for your memory stick? I ended up getting a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse. It works great, links about as fast as a dedicated dongle.The microSD slot is a bit of a pain if you are constantly loading images from a camera. I ended up buying a new microSD card with the full size adaptor and using that in my camera and then just plugging the microSD into the laptop. It works but the microSD is a little touchier about how you plug it in. Would have much preferred a full size adaptor.I tried the fingerprint reader but didn't have a lot of luck with it in conjunction with Windows Hello. It would say it didn't recognize my fingerprint, then when I would say I wanted to add the same finger it would say that fingerprint was already recorded. I'm thinking it is more of a Hello problem than hardware.I haven't tried using the camera for Hello so no comment on that feature. Besides, do you really want the camera to be constantly on, looking for your face? Of course at my age, if anyone gets a peek when I come out of the shower then they deserve what they get - No! No! I can never un-see it!  (By the way, all of you guys buying voice actuated assistants and sprinkling them around your house - YOU'RE INSANE!!!)One minor complaint is that the ""feature"" that lifts the back of the keyboard slightly when you open the lid also lifts the back anti-slip pads off your work surface, making it easy for the laptop to slide around.A bigger problem (I suppose) is that the USB C port is data transfer only.  I haven't verified but I don't believe you can run a display from that port. I called ASUS and they suggested just using a USB 3 dock. (Great gnashing of teeth because I thought that was the whole point of USB C). I say I suppose it's a problem because I've never actually needed to run a monitor from either port as the laptop has a full-sized HDMI port. But, if you are thinking (as I was) that you could buy a USB C docking port with and HDMI, Ethernet and power connection and only have to plug and unplug one cable, you're out of luck. You have to plug in two cables & a power cord instead - oh, the humanity!Overall though, it's a great laptop. Fast, small, light, bright screen, long battery life, no mechanical hard drive rattling around. Cheap at the price.

  **New update 12/5/16 - See below****update 11/26/16 - Check below for updates**Having owned a Surface Pro and a Surface Pro 3, I've become quite addicted to using a pen for writing notes on the screen. When I saw this little notebook announced, I figured I'd keep an eye on it and watch what Asus brought to the table. I've purchased several Asus computers before and I have never been disappointed. Now on to talking about this computer...Pros:+ No BloatwareFirst of all, the computer is a nice little computer with very little bloatware. I was up and running in a few minutes and my account synced up as I knew it would thanks to Windows.+No slowdownsOne of the main concerns I had with the computer was whether or not it would show much slowdown, but so far this little guy is running strong and I've had several tabs open in both Chrome and Edge.+Includes Office (Mobile)The computer does include the mobile version of office (computers in the 10"" range get it for free) so this really helps with the value of the PC in my opinion. You get Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. If you've ever used the OneNote app , the mobile program will be very familiar since it uses the same exact interface.+The PenOne of the things that many users may want to know about is the accuracy of the pen, and I can happily say that the pen performs very well, even in the corners and edges. Many tablets have issues with the digitizers in the corners and the pen will behave erratic. This is NOT an issue here, and I must admit it is very refreshing. The pen does use N-trig technology, so if you happen to have a Surface Pro 3-4, then you have a pen readily available. Anyone with a Surface Pro 4 can tell you what a difference the pen tip from them makes. Here, the pen tip is just like on the Surface Pro 3, which isn't bad, but it does glide faster than a normal pen on the screen. With a little getting used to, you'll be perfectly ok.+Bright ScreenI find myself never going over 40% brightness.+Very low weightGreat for portability and nowhere near as heavy as any of my other computers.+Solid build qualityNo creaks or bends when using the tablet. This tablet feels solid! This computer feels like it is far more expensive than what I paid.Mediocre:0- Screen ResolutionScreen resolution is not as high as it could be, but honestly with a screen this size, you probably don't want a much higher resolution. As it is, the font size can be a bit small (and I don't need glasses)...so the resolution should not be an issue at all for most users.0- The hinge designOkay so maybe the Surface computers have spoiled me, but the hinge here is not as smooth nor does it feel as solid as the Microsoft one. It is nice that there is a hinge, but I'm going to be careful when opening and closing it.Negatives:- The keyboardThis is basically the reason I removed a star. Though solid and doesn't flex when using it, the keys are just too cramped. I find myself straining after a while and you just won't be using this type out very long papers. I actually find the touchscreen keyboard more usable than the physical keyboard. I typed this review while using the keyboard and I also found myself going to just two fingers because I'd often stumble if I tried typing like normal. I've actually never had this happen, so it is actually something worth noting because some users may get very frustrated with this.The other issue with the keyboard is the pen loop. So they provide a pen loop but it is more like a flap where you can use the pen to clip onto by using the metal clasp. I was very confused at first since I am used to sliding the pen into the loop (again, thanks to the Surface) but this requires a different approach. If you aren't using the keyboard, the pen holds very firmly on the bottom where the keyboard attaches and I find that more comfortable if I'm using the tablet as a...well...tablet.Overall I recommend the tablet for anyone looking for a low cost tablet that has pen input. This is better suited for students that need something to take to school that wont break the bank if it falls and breaks. This is also a great secondary computer, or starting tablet, but I hesitate in recommending this as a primary computer.**11/26/16**I've been having BSOD (Blues screen of Death) issues with this computer now. I've noticed if I shut down the computer and start it up, I will almost always get a BSOD due to a driver issue. I did update all the drivers from the ASUS website and I'm still having the crashes. What a shame this is happening now. Hopefully there will be a fix for this since BSOD issues are not a funny matter.Also, I've noticed the screen just isn't as precise as my other devices. I compared the accuracy to two of my other stylus enabled devices and this one falls very far behind the other two. If I was solely comparing this to a surface pro Id understand why this would lose, but I also compared this to a lower end 8"" tablet also built by Asus and it wasn't even close.**12/5/16**So I've done two full wipes on the pc in the search for a solution to my BSOD issues and general lag. There is definitely an issue with an Intel audio driver but I can't seem to get it fixed. I did however fix the general lag it had. Turns out the system is using some older drivers for the integrated graphics. Of course if you go to the ASUS website they do not offer the new drivers to download so you have to get the files directly from Intel and install them yourself (from the INF file). Overall this is just a bad experience for me. I tried to like this computer and you can see the generally positive impressions I had initially. As time goes on I can't justify this tablet in the state that it is in. I think you are better off with a Surface 3 for the price. Yes, you'll need to buy a keyboard but those are going for around $50 on ebay and you'll just have a much better experience than dealing with this tablet. It is really sad. I tried to like you ASUS but as a company, this product feels rushed and not ready. I'm contemplating returning the tablet due to the issues Ive been having.

  I'm a 17 year computer professional and had just had a major failure of my Microsoft Surface Pro 2 128GB, and the Microsoft store wanted to charge me $800 to replace the failed SSD. I had only got about 72 hours of actual runtime out of the thing, since I prefer to do most of my work on my desktop. The ASUS Transformer Mini is an AWESOME deal for the price and performance. That being said, here is what you will NEED to do once you unbox it and boot it up:The Windows Update process takes a few hours. You must let it complete this. It is worth the wait.Second, once the updates are done and you've signed in, don't immediately enroll your fingerprints. Your profile will be erased once you update the drivers.Updating the drivers should be done as follows:Open Device manager, and immediately check for driver updates to firmware. It's important that you do this FIRST. The driver will automatically download and ask you to reboot.Then let it get back into Windows, and update the following drivers: Display driver, Audio, fingerprint sensor.If you do not do what I said the system is a bit laggy. But after all of these updates are done, this is a really great machine with very nice features for the price. Easily comparable to an MS Surface. The audio quality is quite nice, the screen is responsive and bright, and the keyboard (which would run you an EXTRA $100 if you went with a MS Surface) is included. The pen takes an AAAA battery, which may be hard to find.Other than that, I highly recommend this product.

  Let me start off by saying that I do not play video games on my computer. For this I usually use my phone or the old dusty PS3. If you are looking for a portable gaming device, this isn't it. Go look at the nvidia line. Otherwise, this tablet computer is the best of both worlds.Size: Many of the other 2 in 1 devices I have tried are just too big and heavy to hold. You need a desk or a table to set them on. Surface Pro 3 & 4, Lenovo MIIX 700, ASUS Transfromer 3 Pro, I'm looking at you! This 10.1 device is very easy to hold and is light weight for it's size. It feels similar in size to the original iPad. Not the iPad mini or that other 12"" monstrosity but the original size.Keyboard: This is a source of contention for many of the people that have reviewed this unit. What they all seem to neglect is the fact that if you are on the go and using the device, the keyboard works fine. If you are going to do any sort of ""real work"" then just use a nice full size bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Otherwise there is a FULL size USB 3.0 port. Plug in your fancy mechanical keyboard and go to town.Battery: I am getting near the advertised rates. I think they market 11 hours and I could see myself hitting that but realistically I am probably getting closer to 8 or 9 hours. Standby time on a windows tablet is typically not that great and while this tablet is better it's not like an iPad. You shouldn't expect to charge the device on Monday. Leave it turned on then not use it again until Friday and expect the battery to still be full. To avoid standby drain just do a shutdown. It boots back up very quickly so this isn't a huge deal.Speakers: In addition to this tablet I also have a 13.3 inch ASUS UX305FA. This computer cost a lot more and the speakers are about half as good. Not a huge deal since I use the UX305FA for work and do not need the speakers. The ASUS T102HA however is used for entertainment and media consumption. The speakers are perfect for this.Display: I was originally turned off by the low resolution. I didn't want a 4K display or anything but was looking for something that was at least 1080p. The display though is perfect for the size. I was surprised by how clear the picture was when I got it. Reading text is easy and requires no magnification. Video is crystal clear. I'm no expert but the color accuracy looks fine and I can't see any pixels.Storage: 128 GB is okay for me. Most of what I do is in the cloud. I'm not watching pirated video downloaded from the shady corners of the internet so a huge hard drive isn't necessary, thank you Amazon instant video and Netflix. If you do need extra space just get a really fast micro SD card. The prices have come WAY down lately and you should be able to get a decent  128 GB card for around $50. Pop it in and forget about it.Pen: I have to admit that I do not find the pen all that useful. Yes you can write on the screen but my hand writing is good enough to up against any doctor. I type way faster than I could ever write and I am no artist. The pen seems to only be good for clicking, drawing or writing. There is not rubber end that allows you to scroll down a page as you would if you had touched the screen with your finger. I have packed the pen away for now. If anyone has any useful applications or tips for the pen, I am all ears!All in all, I think this is a great device and would recommend it.

  OKAY! So I have had this laptop for several months now. At first everything was awesome then I had issues with the battery not charging all the way up to 100%. I was very unhappy because that can mean a damaged cell. After doing some research I found that ASUS recommends draining the battery to about 50% a couple times a week and allowing it to recharge, this keeps the battery refreshing the cells appropriately. THIS SOLVED THE ISSUE, so after doing so I have had no problems.

  This laptop is great value, and for about 30 bucks or less you can find an extra 8gb stick of ram on amazon to put into the laptop. This would give you 16gb of dual channel ram. The other great feature is this laptop has space for an extra ssd. Some versions (mine did not) have a extra m.2 slot as well as the ssd drive space! This amount of upgradability is wonderful.There is no touch screen which is fine as I do not want to whipe my fingers on my monitor anyway. The screen being 144hz is awesome and looks fantastic.The processor when rendering video or gaming can get to 80 C at peak load, you can easily fix this by getting a cooling fan pad for under the laptop and setting the power and fan settings to silent under the armory crate which comes installed on the computer. I now rarely hit super high temps.The only real complaint is the high processor temps which when compared with my other laptop which was a 2018 MacBook pro, those temps are actually cooler as my previous laptop would get so hot on the underside it would burn me, which this computer always at least physically seems cool.I would recommend this laptop for anyone who wants something that can be used to edit videos, for school, or light gaming. It runs stuff like overwatch, league, and valorant well. It also runs every indie game that I have played on it very well. I would recommend it to anyone who wants what is basically a portable version of an entry-level gaming pc.Oh, the light-up keyboard is cool too.Also when using Bluetooth the wifi may have issues due to the wifi chip they used in this laptop, this issue fixed itself after some windows updates and new drivers from myAsus. So any mentions of that issue in other reviews can be disregarded as simple software updates fixed this issue.Over all, 5/5 for the price and being able to be upgraded out of the box so easily!

  This laptop is fantastic, don't bother with the nonsense on YouTube, only DigitalFoundry was correct ! The processor is tuned very well and it does hit high temps when boosting, but that happens to all Ryzen, it's the higher vcore needed for the boost and this laptop does expel the heat efficiently when the clocks drop. I would advise anyone using this laptop to go into the power plan and change the settings to the attached pic, while noting that 99% will cut power by a lot!What is being ignored by the  most it seems is the quality of the audio, it's very good for a Windows machine! The 144 hz screen is very good, it isn't color accurate but it's a gaming laptop!!!  If you want a great value ""gaming"" laptop then this is it!UPDATE: Bios 313 brings a lot of bug fixes. This new bios seems to do the same thing that the new Ryzen 5000 compatibility update has done for Ryzen 3000 on the B450 boards, more stable boost clocks and vcore probably via the new Agesa. Well worth the update!

  Ive had this laptop for about 2 weeks now. When I bought it I was looking for something that can comfortably run a couple games, but nothing crazy.I have a couple games downloaded  like skyrim, Witcher 3, and Assassins Creed Oddessy(so open world adventure games), and have been using it for browsing/work. No issues. Laptop has been smooth, can run high graphics and although storage is low for me at 512GB, got an external hard drive thats doing the trick. Havent downloaded any mods yet but given its performance so far I think itll be fine. Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase.

  There is now a 2020 model of this laptop with 16gb ram and 1tb SSD which I feel is a much better value than this one.Overall I am very happy with this laptop for its intended purpose - playing some of my games at low settings when I‚Äôm away from home for a few weeks at a time.At the price there are a lot of tradeoffs. The hardware is truly low end, and there is not enough space for more than 3-4 of today‚Äôs games. 8gb ram is adequate for now.This laptop is about equivalent to a low end gaming PC. It is definitely not a primary PC, but is nice to have as a secondary if you travel a lot.For people that only want one gaming device, this wouldn‚Äôt be my choice. I‚Äôd choose a larger screen and at least a 1660ti gpu. For the small screen on this laptop the low end cpu/gpu combo is fine. A desktop can be built that performs better for half the price, but that‚Äôs always the case with laptops.It has very minimal RAM and SSD space. Both are upgradable, but prying the back panel off is difficult, and requires a small plastic wedge, not just a screw driver. If upgrades are planned, I would do them all at once so as to avoid having to take is apart multiple times.The one real downside is that the fan is very very loud.

  After having used this piece of equipment for a week, I've concluded that this is a very cheaply-built, yet medium-high performing laptop. The key deck is plastic and flexes about .003"" - .004"" in the center under my keystroke pressure. I feel-out how much pressure is necessary to depress the keys. I typically apply this principle across the board in order to prevent undo wear and extend the life of my belongings. The keys are mushy but tactile enough to get the feel of how far they have to travel before registering. The keys are quieter than the ones on my Mid 2010 Apple MacBook Pro. The keyboard backlight is good. ASUS's TUF Aura Core app is required if you want to change the color and settings. There are only 3 brightness levels apart from ""OFF."" The brushed plastic finish is relatively easy to keep clean, but it's flimsy cheap as well. The machine performs well, but I'm mostly utilizing the i5-9300H processor and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM this has since I don't do intense gaming. It will accept up to 32 GB DDR4 2666 (PC4 21300) RAM. If gaming is what you're looking for, I would look up comparisons between 4 GB and 6 GB graphics cards. At this point, I think 6GB would be worth the difference. Use the function key and hit F5 to toggle between ""silent, performance, and turbo."" This corresponds to processors clock speed. Silent is about 1.8 GHz, performance is standard clock speed of 2.8 (?), And turbo around 4.0. Note that this has no internal optical drive, so you'll need to purchase a separate one if you want to run CDs/DVDs. The matte display is nice. I've had a glossy one for years. I think that the color reproduction is more realistic than most monitors I've seen.Overall, I like it. I'll be babying it, but I think it will serve me well for a long time.

  Purchased to run as a dedicated DJ laptop. Solid machine and runs Serato DJ Pro perfectly, with almost nothing showing up on the CPU meter. RGB keyboard is nice, but I run it ‚Äúwhite‚Äù most of the time. Need to install the free ‚ÄúTUF Aura Core‚Äù app from Microsoft store to customize keyboard colors (no ‚Äúper-key‚Äù or zone coloration on this model). Only 3 USB ports (two 3.0 and one 2.0) so watch your device hookups, or have a hub handy. No media card slot or optical drive. Lightweight and nicely portable. Moved down from the 17.3‚Äù display on my previous DJ laptop, but am already used to the smaller 15.6‚Äù screen. As this is a gaming laptop, it does not have touchscreen capability. No worries. Very happy with it and plan on DJing off of it for years. Completely satisfied.

  I bought this to function as the only household PC for myself + foster home. Wanted something that is durable and able to support medium-intensity gaming plus any other day-to-day abuse that kids could throw at it, and also has the graphics firepower to enable me to dabble in video editing. Since this is functioning as a de-facto desktop, the size, weight and battery life compromises did not bother me; in fact, I like the fact that I can limit the length of gaming sessions simply by hiding the power cord. The customisable RGB keyboard is a fun touch, and it will be fun to change the keyboard colour to suit the tastes of different foster kids. The screen quality is great, really enjoy the clarity.  I also love that there is room to upgrade the RAM and storage -- as an aspiring sewing blogger I still don't know if I will focus more on text or video, so having the option to increase RAM and add a hard drive later, while incurring lower upfront costs now, is perfect to allow me to phase in functionality depending on how my content evolves.

  IMPORTANT: The model (GA401IH-BR7N2BL) does not have a 120hz display. The product was listed as having a 120hz refresh rate which is not true. This model number, as far as I know, does not come with the 120hz display.It is impressive how slim and lightweight this laptop is and the performance it offers. I got the lowest spec one with the GTX 1650 and I have no complaints. The only downsides to this computer are a lack of Thunderbolt 3, no Webcam, and the soldered ram. There is one free ram slot which is nice but only supports dual channel up to 16gb. A couple of tweaks are also required to get the most out of the computer's battery. The laptop itself feels very premium. The keys are surprisingly big considering how small the laptop is.  The speakers are pretty good and have some pretty clean sound with a reasonable amount of bass.

  If you compare this to other Windows laptops, this is a beautiful, ultra-lightweight, ultra-portable one. But even in that comparison, you have an important ""but"". Consider that I am using the basic configuration: AMD 4800HS, GTX 1650 with 60HZ display. Playing only League of Legends, viewing HD movies and videos, and also working in Data Science.When playing LoL under low specs or watching an HD movie, this laptop can easily heat above 60 degrees celsius. If you want, you can personalize the cooling system to high cooling to avoid 60¬∞C or whatever mark you think is too hot. But it would be super noisy.Why am I stating this point? An M1 Mac under heavy processor usage would stay around 40¬∞C, and that's without any cooling. Even the Mac Pro from 2019 won't surpass 50¬∞C under heavy usage. Why is heating important? Because any electronic would face a shorter life if it's usually operated under high temperatures. Also, a laptop operating on 60¬∞C or 70¬∞C is annoying to work with if you want to use it on your lap.Of course, you can take this laptop to its maximum performance, using any Data Science algorithm that could use 100% CPU for one hour and/or 100% GPU. You would see fast results, ones that usually you would only expect on a desktop PC. But it will heat up to 100¬∞C, and to keep it running, the cooling system should be at it 100% where the noise would be very annoying.Considering the heat produced under medium usage, a better idea could be to buy a bigger windows laptop where cooling is easier or think about M1 Macs. Who knows, an M1 Mac could let you play LoL with high specs and never heating above 40¬∞C.Finally, the famous 8hr battery life only applies when your processing usage is super low. Playing LoL under low specs would dry it on 3 hours.

  Great seller, will buy from him again. Rapid response to enquiry about international shipping.I have used the ROG for 45 days now and it just shine on anything. Heavy gaming, multiple apps, video/photos. A bit heavier than my older 14 inches but ok trade-off for a gaming beast.Added 8GB ram from crucial and it just flies. Not so hard to open up but check youtube (1 corner screw doesn't come off from lid by design).Ryzen boot up around 10-12s. What else can you need?

  Works great as a small laptop. Although there are some annoying software updates to maintain the amazing 9+ hours battery, overall, a great laptop for the price.

  The g14 is an amazing laptop for the money, all the power you could want with none of the sacrifices. It has some quirks though like having to enable a Dolby profile to relize the full potential of its well above average speakers, or having to hibernate/reboot the laptop every 2 charge cycles to match the 10 hours of light use it should get, or even needing to install a 3rd party app to reign in the loud at idle fans. The listing might say touch screen or 144hz for the base model but that is not the case, the 60hz non touch panel it actually has is a little dim, but with some very good colors. Not something I can use outside comfortably but for indoor media consumption it's very nice, especially with how nice the built in speakers are. As for prefomance its well equipt to play any games at it's 1080p resolution at 60hz, and while the fans get a bit loud, there are seemingly no thermal throttling issues. The build quality is good but not exceptional, it's solid but you can tell with things like the plastic bottom panel that it's not a MacBook but it still manages to feel more then sturdy. Over all it's a great laptop for the money, if you address those quirks I mentioned above

  I'm coming from using a desktop that I built in 2014. The upgrade so far is hard to notice so far. I took a 4 GB RAM downgrade but the GPU is an improvement. When I game its very loud, which isn't surprising since ASUS has two different fan settings for DC (battery) and AC (plugged in) - which is quite neat.The main con is the typical shortfall of all laptops. Gimmicky features that stop responding and required to be forced stopped or touch pad being nonresponsive are the two consistent ones. Luckily I use peripherals and don't care for the ASUS bloatware/monitoring software.For the price point I'm satisfied and would recommend this machine or a cheaper model.EDIT: I started to have issues with peripherals connected to both USB C and USB A hubs. I was regularly having ASUS apps not responding. I did a clean install three days ago and have yet to have any of these issues (though I have ordered another USB C hub).No product is perfect. But a clean install is a must.

  I don't normally bother to leave reviews. This laptop is great. It has solid build quality, comfortable keyboard and a responsive touchpad.The only downside is that this particular model doesn't have the anime matrix display on the flip side of the screen. The little holes in the body are there, but there are no lights inside. I was under the assumption that all G14s had that option. I personally don't care for such a cool-but-useless feature, but if you're going to have the holes there, they might as well do something. I also have concerns about the holes being an ingress point for dirt, so I'll try to find some sort of sticky plastic to cover them up.

  I'm not much of a specs person, so I did a lot of looking at reviews to find a laptop that would work for my needs and this one fit the bill! The first laptop I ordered had an issue with the spacebar out of the box. I contacted ASUS support and they gave me a case number which I then took to Amazon Customer Service to return. After speaking to rep, I had a new laptop in my hands two days later without the spacebar issue. Everything works just great and I realized the first laptop also had a screen color issue that the one I now have does not. Very happy with my purchase and no complaints so far!

  The laptop wasn‚Äôt as thick as I thought it would be, it has great dimensions and thickness making it portable and easy to lift. Not too heavy.The keyboard is great, I really enjoy the quick feedback it gives when I press a key, the keys aren‚Äôt too loud either when yo click them.You can switch GPU‚Äôs depending if you want more of a gaming experience or not or to conserve battery. The fans do start whirring if you start playing games like APEX on relatively high settings but that‚Äôs expected, it isn‚Äôt loud enough to be too noticeable which headphones on. It will easily play games like War Thunder on high graphics. If you aren‚Äôt gaming the laptop will be pretty quiet if you set it to silent or windows mode. It took meSome time to figure out how to use the function keys. It‚Äôs probably best that I got the GTX 1660 model instead of the RTX model just because of the more powerful GPU creating more heat and eating battery. I‚Äôm not an expert on the matter of GPUsThe charging port is close to the front of the laptop but that isn‚Äôt really an issue for me. This model does not have the LED‚Äôs on the back of the screen, no biggie.I tried installing steam right after setting up the system and what not but couldn‚Äôt. I got a steamduii error, I didn‚Äôt bother trying to fix the error, didn‚Äôt want to damage any software in the process. There goes my dream of playing TF2. I don‚Äôt know what is at fault, all I know is I couldn‚Äôt install steam on a new laptop.Laptop is well worth the money

  The specifications of this laptop are off the charts for the price. I really wanted a fast laptop for work, with gaming capabilities as a bonus. It was hard to find a modern processor such as a 9th generation core i7 matched with a minimum of 8 GB ram and a competent graphics card. This laptop was the one I could find for a really affordable price. Most laptops that I found that were matched with fast working processors and competent graphics card had bad thermal issues, but this laptop‚Äôs cooling capabilities are insane. It also has a really strong screen hinge, although it seems unlike it. Its brushed aluminum feel and robust touch pad are also attractive. Its only cons would be the lack of sd card reader and thunderbolt 3 ports, and of course, a webcam. But honestly, most laptops have terrible webcam quality. I find it more prudent to purchase a quality webcam separately.Edit: it is true that the laptop‚Äôs keyboard is not functional at times. There has been many times for me the keyboard stopped working until one day it completely stopped. I sent it to ASUS and their customer service is EXTREMELY poor, but regardless, it‚Äôs fixed. This is largely because this is a new unit, so the hardware is not fully functional in many of the units, so gladly its not a software issue, rather a hardware. Given a warantee, I highly suggest getting it fixed ASAP if you‚Äôre an owner of this laptop already

  Before I gave this laptop a great review but that was before using it for a couple weeks. The keyboard randomly locks up and stops working. It takes around 3 to 5 restarts to get it to work again even after updating all of the drivers, updating windows, and reinstalling the drivers. To make it worse this is a known issue among Asus brand laptops. DO NOT BUY ASUS LAPTOPS. I'm returning this scam of a product.

  First off - I like the background color scheme of the laptop keys - my roommate thinks the color cycling is beautiful. The programmer in me likes something a little simpler so I stopped the color cycling and just stuck it on a single color, white. Virtualization. Runs Oracle's VirtualBox without any trouble - Windows 10 inside of Windows 10 works very well. Gaming. I'm not running 2020's top-tier games with this laptop, so my experience will vary from a lot of other gamer reviews. Running GTA 5 with high-quality graphics heats this laptop up significantly - but there's no thermal throttling going on that I'm aware of. Programming. Runs Visual Studio 2019 Community very quickly - I haven't had a chance to compile any bigger projects in it yet - but I imagine this processor will make these compile-times go fairly quickly. Thanks for reading my review,

  I love this gaming laptop probably the best one i've ever gotten. You get the best experience on this gaming laptop and its very smooth... if youre trying to get higher fps though. I suggest you get a monitor specifically with a ethernet hmdi cable you don't have to have ethernet but then once you connect the laptop to the monitor its the BEST. I totally recommend this laptop if you're trying to find RGB or Budget and just gaming experience in general.

  ¬†I came across this computer while looking to replace my previous laptop, a predecessor of this one, the Zenbook 3 (UX390). I had it for about 2 years and the only issue I had out of it was some strange fan noise occasionally.I liked the innovative use of the trackpad as a secondary screen, the dedicated MX250 graphics, as well as a 10th gen i7 CPU. So I decided to pull the trigger on a brand that has worked well for me in the past.*The Good*The computer itself is built very well. Zero screen flex, nice rigid keyboard deck, silky smooth trackpad, and the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. The screen pad is neat, but kind of a novelty mostly.Overall performance is snappy, and light gaming can be done without it breaking a sweat. The small form factor and solid build quality make it easy to want to take it along wherever you're going.*The Bad*After two weeks of ownership, however, I have decided to return this computer for screen related issues.Within a few days of having it, I began to notice faint lines in the screen that were lighter than the rest of it. This was most apparent when displaying a solid color on a large portion of the screen. These lines would come and go, and weren't super obvious unless a solid color was displayed. I also noticed some flickering at times as well.Then, while watching Netflix the other day, the entire screen suddenly became washed out and flickery. Two restarts and a full factory reset have confirmed that it's a hardware fault and not a driver or software issue.I had high hopes for this computer, and I'm sure this is an isolated flaw in my particular unit, but a major hardware failure two weeks into ownership has me wanting to go with something else instead.

  Laptop has some good points, and but also some issues. I purchased one and returned, but based on all other glowing reviews decided to try another - and had similar results. That one was returned also.Construction was excellent with a premier look, great fit and finish. Keyboard back light was good - evenly lit keys. However, I found the key travel a little ""mushy"", and the right hand shift key was tiny and squeezed in. Sound was good from speakers. Updating went well.The deal breaker for me was the screen - and both suffered from this. Where is the quality control?Once on, screen had adequate brightness, but had a lot of light bleed around edges in dark areas. To me, this is unacceptable in a higher end laptop. My cheap $275 laptop with narrow bezels has less bleed. Color was good - except for white color balance - more on that later.I did notice the laptop seemed to run hot - even on light loads - and yes, the fans were running. Certainly no way to be a ""lap"" top - would need to be placed on a cooler.The ScreenPad is a neat gimmick, would take some getting used to and explore the full capabilities of it. I did find I could not remove certain ""icons"" from pad home screen - such as ""sheets"", ""slides"" etc., not completely customizable. Using as a traditional touch pad, it felt smooth, and worked well.Now to last issue, and final reason for return....I personally cannot stand the default ""blue filter"" color balance most laptops are now sent with. To me, white should be white, not a greenish / reddish tint. I found that after balancing the white in advanced settings, the settings would not remain upon restart. Don't know if there was some conflict between the 2 monitors (Screen Pad is recognized as a second monitor), or some other software issue, but would constantly have to re-balance colors.Again, this may not be an issue - or even noticed by many users, but I would think it not good for photo work, or not the best for natural looking movies.

  The Asus UX430UN is an excellent laptop for programming, light-gaming*, and general computing. It gets great battery life when doing moderate multitasking like running multiple desktops open at a time and having Atom (script editor for web development), 15+ Firefox tabs, and Spotify running concurrently. So far it seems to run all my programs with aplomb, and I don‚Äôt notice any lagging or slowness. I have also read other reviews on the Internet for this laptop stating that they had issues with coil whine, and I have experienced this issue as well due to the solid state drive emitting a high pitched static sound, which is slightly irritating. However, it‚Äôs not a huge deal for me, and it isn‚Äôt a reason to return this laptop. What is extremely irritating though, is Asus marketing this laptop as having ‚Äúimpressive gaming performance‚Äù, which simply isn‚Äôt true. Due to thermal throttling the GPU at 73 degrees Celsius, the performance of the laptop decreases significantly, resulting in reduced and fluctuating clock speeds. Asus should have completely redesigned the cooling system for the UN model, as opposed to the integrated graphics in the UA model. Instead, they left a single fan for the CPU and a shared heatsink with the GPU, resulting in incredibly high temperatures for the Nvidia MX150. Note, there is NO FAN for the GPU. I seriously can‚Äôt believe they would release this laptop with a flaw such as this, but I guess they don‚Äôt actually expect people will use this for anything other than photo and video editing. If this is the case, then Asus should remove their false marketing for this laptop from their website, stating this is strictly for photo and video editing because the cooling design cannot handle anything more than that. Even with light gaming such as Assassin‚Äôs Creed Directors Cut edition or Warframe, there exists lag and stuttering issues (much more so in Warframe, and I‚Äôm talking about low settings in the latter and high in the former). Bitter diatribe aside, my main purpose for purchasing this laptop was for programming, so I cannot be too upset by the poor graphics performance. In addition, one can ameliorate the poor performance of the GPU by following some of my suggestions at the bottom of this review. Overall, I am giving this laptop four stars, because it suits most of my needs and performs admirably in most tasks. Besides my brief overview, here is a list of pros and cons to help you decide whether you should purchase this Zenbook:Pros:‚Ä¢ 14‚Äù NanoEdge FHD IPS matte display greatly reduces glare and offers good brightness levels and covers a broader sRGB color spectrum than most‚Ä¢ Stunning, thin and light design that delivers 2.76 lbs (1.25 kg) of weight and a 0.6 in (15.9 mm) thick chassis making portability extremely manageable‚Ä¢ Backlit Keyboard with 3 brightness levels makes typing in the dark much easier‚Ä¢ Excellent performance with the Kaby Lake-R i7 processor and 16 GB of LPDDR3 RAM (dual-channel, vs Lenovo Ideapad 720s 14)‚Ä¢ Good battery life (6-9 hours on Better Battery mode with moderate multitasking)‚Ä¢ Excellent keyboard travel makes typing a breeze‚Ä¢ Smooth Precision trackpad with Elan drivers makes swiping gestures extremely easy and produces a satisfying click‚Ä¢ All the required ports are included, making it easy to forgo carrying 80 million dongles everywhere like with a lot of Lenovo, Microsoft, or Apple productsCons:‚Ä¢ Poor solid state drive performance from Sandisk x400 m.2 SATAIII SSD (You can upgrade this one to a PCI-E NVMe SSD like Samsung‚Äôs 960 Pro if you want)‚Ä¢ Elan fingerprint sensor with Windows Hello works about half the time and you must place your finger in a very specific way for it to work.‚Ä¢ Light gaming is severally hindered by thermal throttling at 73 degrees Celsius due to a poorly designed cooling solution (Look at the Lenovo Ideapad 720s 14 if occasional gaming is important to you)‚Ä¢ Coil whine from the SSD is bothersome‚Ä¢ Fan noise can get quite loud, even if one is just doing light to moderate multitasking (though this can be fixed by following the guidelines at the bottom of this review)‚Ä¢ Lacks Thunderbolt 3 for charging, fast data transfer, video output, or even eGPU option*To make this laptop much better at light gaming and reduce frame rate drops and lag, one can underclock the MX150 GPU (reducing heat output and reduced clock speeds), use a fan controller software from GitHub, and purchase a laptop cooling pad. First, I used MSI‚Äôs Afterburner to underclock the CPU to 1350 MHz at peak voltage. I‚Äôve included a screenshot for the curve I edited. This seems to give the best results in games with low to medium graphics settings, and it reduced the lag quite a bit. Next, I used Notebook FanControl from GitHub with the Asus UX430UQ configuration file (older model, but virtually the same) to increase the output of air from the CPU fan (the only fan) during gaming. This helped with the thermal issues, and it greatly reduced the fan noise to near silence when I just did basic to moderate multitasking. Finally, I suggest purchasing one of the two cooling pads listed below to help cool the laptop during gaming sessions. I purchased the one by Tecknet, and it helped cool the laptop significantly. My laptop no longer got burn-you-severely-with-the-slightest-touch hot, thus making gaming much more comfortable for extended periods of time. Follow ALL these suggestions, and it will be a much better experience to game on this laptop.

  The seller description is a little off, so I first need to clarify some specs.True Product Description (Updated 9/8/2018)This laptop is the UX430UQ with i7-8550U / 16GBS RAM /512SSD SATA M.2 / MX150 / QUARZ GRAY (Non-NIL) / With Finger Print Reader / WIN10 HOME / 1080p 100%sRGB (Mate Display). So, the display isnt Glossy, and the picture doesnt show the fingerprint reader, but it comes with one. In the box you will find only the laptop and the adpator. (No sleeve or dongles included in this model)Build Quality: (Updated 9/8/2018)The laptop itself is gorgeous to look at, with narrow bezels and more powerfull specs I chose this laptop over the XPS13 for a better PRICE/SPEC ratio. Its thicker and sharper than the Asus Zenbook UX305UA, and the power adapter is also bigger than the UX3XX line, but it has the same footprint, and a way larger screen. The build quality is not as good as the UX3XX Line, but it will d,  and has little flex on the keyboard and screen. The Gun-Metal Gray (quarz gray) has a mate finish and show fingerprints easily. (This could be anoying) All the ports are tightly packed and there is no visible mis-allingment of the chasis. Good job Asus!Screen (Updated 9/8/2018)The screen itself has a good Color Accuracy, matching my dedicated monitor Viewsonic 27"" VP2770 in color apereance. I tested it out with the Spyder 5 PRO and its shows 93% sRGB. Its also sharp but not very bright, mesures up to 220nits. One problem is the PWM flickering, that shows in every single brightness level. No dead pixels or significant light bleed seen so far. Its sux for gaming, its not a fast response screen tho.Speakers:I wasnt specting something good. Laptop speaker are always crap, but they sound actualy pretty good.Far better and louder than the speakers on the Asus UX305UA. This is not a weak point on this laptop, speakers wont disappoint.Keyboard and Trackpad.The keyboard its ok. In this point i like more the Keyboard found on the Asus Zenbook UX305UA. This one has a shorter key travel, despite been a thicker laptop. The Keys backlighting is dim, you wont see it in a bright enviroment. The trackpad in the other hand its way better than in the UX305UA. Its more responsive, less glichy and admits hands gestures. Also it has a Fingerprint reader.Performance:Adobe Lightroom CC Test - i7 8550U version (Updated 9/8/2018)Culling and Developing in LR CC (2018 with its new engine) it's way better than I initially expected. For a real job test, I develop (Basic exposure, curves, split toning, sharpening and noise reduction) and exported 950 Canon 5Dmk4 raw files to Full size JPG with 60% compresion.LR Raw/JPG Conversion test - 950 Raw (5D4)Asus Zenbook UX430UQ (i7 7500U - 16GBS DDR3) - 95 minutes.Asus Zenbook UX430UNR (i7 8550U - 16GBS DDR3) - 67 minutes.Desktop ( i7 5820K X99 - 32GBS DDR4) - 35 minutes.Geekbench:UX430UQ - Single Core 4345 / Multicore 8752UX430UNR - Single Core 4558 / Multicore 14890Thermal throttling:If you use the GPU and the CPU at the same time at full load it will throttle. But if the CPU or GPU are used independly, they will do just fine. Thermals are good.MX150 Performance:In the game department the only game i was able to test so far its Blizzard Heroes of the Storm. It can run over 60fps if you play High Settings at 1080p. This is by no mean a gaming laptop, the MX150 its crap for games, but it can handle E-Sports tittles in a playable way for your spare time. Its just like a desktop GTX1030.Battery life:Normal Use - Browsing: more than 6-7 hours.Heavy Use - Rendering / Editing: 1.5 Hours.Cooling, Fan-Noise and Coil whining:No coil-whining in my unit. But it heats up pretty intensively during heavy processing task to an unconfortable degree, and the fans kick aggressively making some noise. Not a lot of noise, but you can cleary hear when their are on. Its hard to pack CPU+GPU in such a tiny chassis and get proper cooling. Cooling could improve in future models.Problems or Gliches.:The fingerprint reader on my second unit its glichy... somedays it works flawlessly.. somedays it doest work at all.In general its a good laptop so far. Feel free to try it out, you probably will like it too.This is from an Photographer perspective. My other PC its an X99 i7 5820K build, and i feel confortable with this Laptop as my mobility driver.

  I've read a lot of negative reviews about this laptop.First, it's very fast.  The I7 8th generation is great.  Paired with the 16GB and the SSD, there's no delays.  A lot of people are complaining about not having a PCIe M2 SSD in here, but in real-world usage I just don't think it would make any difference.  Taking a star (or 2 or even 3) off because of something that you literally wouldn't notice in an A/B test is utterly ridiculous, especially at this price point.  And you can still replace it whenever you want if it really matters to you that much and still come out ahead of a Dell XPS.Coil whine: none.  I can put my ear right up to the keyboard and I hear nothing.  This laptop is very, very quiet under most usage.  Sure, if you run a very taxing load or a high-end game on it, the fans will spin up and make tons of noise, but I don't do that on laptops.  I have a gaming/coding PC for that.The keyboard is just like my old Zenbook, which is my all-time favorite laptop keyboard.The trackpad is pretty good.  It's got a nice feel and tap-to-click works well.  Also double-tap and drag.  Still a little slow to respond to gestures (not sure if that's just a Windows thing), but I haven't had any excessive CPU usage or anything.  Oh, and the fingerprint scanner may as well not exist because it certainly doesn't work at all.The battery life easily gets 9-10 hours for me (I keep the screen on 25%).  Since I close the lid when I'm not using it, this can be 2-3 days around the house.In summary, I really REALLY love this laptop for the price.

  First off, let me start by saying, if you want a quick review then here it is:Buy it.Feel free to read the tips and notes at the bottom of this review just in case. Now, on to the rest...This is, without a doubt, the best value laptop you can buy today. Let me break down some of the components:Display--------------------The display is beautiful. This model comes with a few different presets you can choose from, I'm a fan of the ""vivid"" setting since I'm a sucker for vibrance and color. Every game I've played or movie I've watched looks stunning. The viewing angles are quite amazing as well.Touchscreen--------------------I didn't think I'd use it to be honest. I felt like it would be one of those cheap, semi-responsive, fury-inducing gimmicks that I've seen all too much in other touchscreen models. Well, it's not, in fact it's amazing. It's incredibly responsive and smooth to the touch. I use it often to scroll through long webpages with my thumb or I use the swipe ""back"" gesture to traverse through my history, which is very handy.Trackpad--------------------The trackpad itself it good, not great. That's not to say it is bad by any means. The trackpad feels fine but it's the clicking I have an issue with. You can only really tap mid-left for left click and mid-right for right click. If you try pressing down on the far left or right of the trackpad, you will notice it feels stiff and unresponsive. I've turned off mostly all the gestures as I'm not a fan, but overall the trackpad does it's job. Best thing about any trackpads is if you don't like it, you can just use a mouse. Still slightly annoying but at least the option is there.Keyboard--------------------The keyboard is usually my make-or-break component since it's obviously the most used. I previously owned a Sager I ordered online and instantly hated it when I began to type on it because of it's raised, paper-thin plastic with deep grooves in the center of each key. It wasn't for me. These keys are solid and responsive, though there is a little give and bend when you push towards the center of the board, it's not the greatest laptop keyboard of all time, but it is certainly not a detriment to the overall quality.GPU--------------------This particular aspect of the laptop is usually very important to me because I do enjoy gaming on my laptop. After several hours of comparing benchmarks with other similar laptops, I'm more than happy with the performance that the GTX850M is capable of. Everything that I've played on this laptop runs beautifully. I can run most modern games on ultra settings with a passable framerate, but for the sake a playability I usually tone it down to medium or high. If this is your main concern and this review is still somewhat relevant, don't let this stop you. It's a fantastic GPU.Hard Drive--------------------Not much to say here, the HDD that the laptop comes with isn't great. Actually, it's god awful. It's so bad that I don't even want to type it's RPM. I'd consider it a bit bottleneck considering how fast the rest of the machine is. I replaced this laptop's HDD with a Samsung EVO 256GB SSD and it's blown me away just how much quicker it is. If you're going to buy this laptop, I'd HIGHLY recommend picking up a SSD for it.Speakers--------------------Good sound, not amazing. The speaker placement is sort of confusing to me, I'd say the speakers are probably one of the most unfavorable things about the laptop. The audio ports can be quite tight at times as well. If you plan on playing music with this often, then you'll need to find the right surface to put it on to give it decent sound. I don't really use the subwoofer module much as it's not that impressive... but I suppose it's there if you'd like to use it.Battery Life--------------------The battery life is actually pretty good, it's something to respect in a market where most laptops die fairly quick while doing menial tasks. Again, it's not a selling point of the laptop, but it's not something that should not bother you by any means.Overall--------------------So, this laptop is incredible for the price. You get solid components across the board (build quality, battery, display, graphics, etc.) except for the hard drive (ASUS what were you thinking?). This laptop doesn't have features that are top-notch (maybe besides the display, but even then 1440p would have been nice), but the point is that this laptop does mostly everything right. Simply, you get a very high quality laptop that will last you quite a while. I'm very happy with this laptop and I really think it's worth every penny. Plus it's nice to play Hearthstone with the touch screen, which is fun little bonus.Miscellaneous Notes & Tips--------------------1.) If you're going to replace anything in this laptop, YOU NEED A TORX T5 SCREWDRIVER. Not a T6, not a T5 2/9s, a T5. I went mad trying to find one in my area and had to wait a few days to replace the hard drive in this laptop.2.) If you're going to install Windows 8 on an SSD, you need a Windows 8.1 ISO that you can boot from. The key is bundled with the machine so you won't need to put it in when installing.3.) If you replace the SDD, then replace it with were the original hard drive is. DO NOT put it where the optical drive is. I mean, you could, but you would be wasting a lot of the speed benefits of the SSD and then at that point... what's the point of even having an SSD? Keep this in mind.4.) I replaced the optical drive with the original hard drive that the laptop came with. It's slow, sure, but it's just fine for storing media on it. Run your OS on the SSD if possible and keep all your games, movies, documents, etc. on this spare drive. The bezel on the optical drive can be taken off and snapped into the side of the laptop so there isn't a gaping hole where the optical drive used to be. I recommend taking out the optical drive and putting it in a slim enclosure so you have a portable USB optical drive if you ever need to use it.Will update in the future.Thanks!

  Before my review, I just want to say that I am no computer expert. I am a high school teacher, a grad school student, and a typical, everyday computer user.I wanted to give myself at least 6 months with this computer before reviewing it, and I have just passed that mark. There are a number of things that I like about this computer. First, it is fast for my needs. I do some gaming, but it is not regular, nor are my games needy in terms of requiring the full processing power of the computer. I mostly use the internet and Office programs. In my everyday tasks, I have never had a lag issue and I move seamlessly from one application/program to another. The touchscreen is flawless and also helps in switching between applications. While it seems silly at first, the power cord is sufficiently long enough. Finally, and quite importantly, I have never had an overheating issue.Now, there are unfortunately many things that I am disappointed with. First, the computer is already breaking. The headphone jack is very unresponsive and cuts out frequently, there are a number of dead pixels in the screen, and the hinge is super flimsy, creaking and making snapping sounds with every movement. This is a big issue for me, and I know it is just a matter of time before I need to send it in. The keyboard is not very responsive, which leads to many typos. The CD tray is in a horrible spot. It is always coming open, even if I do not hit the button. Finally, the speakers are in a bad location and the laptop must be placed on a hard surface to be able to appreciate the decent quality sound that the speakers produce.The laptop does what I need it to do, despite a number of hardware issues. When all is said and done, however, I am not very impressed with the computer considering I paid just over $1,000.To recap, here is a list of pros and cons:Pros:-Pretty quick for my needs-Great for multitasking-Excellent display quality-Decent sound-Long power cord-No overheatingCons:-The headphone port is already broken-The display already has multiple dead pixels-The CD tray is horribly-placed. I open it nearly every time I put it in my bag, and it even sometimes open when I set it on the table.-The speaker placement is terrible. In order to get decent sound, the laptop MUST be placed on a hard surface, as the speakers are in the front at an angle toward the user.-The hinge is very weak, and creaks with any movement.-The keyboard is not very responsive.

  Overview: double USB-C 3.2, IPS screen, 4700u processor, 1TB drive, Win10 Pro make this a special ZenBook buildLooking for the best laptop for work in 2020?  You found it.  Let's break down why:1. Processor:  AMD 4700U processor is at the top of the passmark charts.  And, it barely sips power between 10-20W.2. Display:  This is one of the only ASUS laptop builds with an IPS screen and it looks amazing from any angle!3. Ports: USB-C 3.2 double output is huge!  I am running two 4K displays with no adapters!  I bought the Phillips 27"" ASIN B07WKX11JY that has USB-C dock, that is such a great combination with this laptop.  Benefits include: I do not have to use the laptop charging cable!  The Monitor connection to the laptop via USB-C actually charges the laptop!  Also, the USB-C plugs into the monitors, and each of these has 2 USB 3.1 out!  So I can plug in my mouse, keyboard, and other ""traditional"" USB accessories to the monitors, and they just work!  I don't even need a dongle, wow.  I purchased this cable: Amazon model no RAMPOW-TT02-US, a 2 meter USB-C 3.2 for my second 27"" screen because the 1 meter cable that came with it is not long enough to reach the laptop.4. Drive: 1TB drive will never run out of space.  SSD boot times are ridiculous.  From cold start to signin screen in 3 seconds.  From sleep to signin screen in less than 1 second, pretty much instant.  I run disk-intensive commands like ""npm install"" for work, which used to consume a lot more time, now they just fly.5. Bonuses:Factory sealed box.  Not a third-party upgrade.  This came straight from ASUS.Extremely fast shipping, received 3 days after order.Really cool feature of touchpad, there's a toggle switch to turn it into a full size number pad.Bang and Olufsen audio is on point (for a laptop)Windows 10 pro preinstalled.  wow.  But be careful during your first install though.  Do not choose ""Windows Live Account"" at first, if you care about the name of your user folder.  Enter the name of your desired user folder as your name first, as a local account.  Later, ""convert"" that account to using Windows Live, or else it will use the first 5 letters of your email address as your user folder name, which for me was not acceptable.Being a work computer, touch screen was not as important to me, as the future-proof specs of this laptop.I researched all the ASUS, Lenovo, Thinkpad, and Dell builds out there, and after a week of solid research, this is the one I landed on, and I could not be happier.

  The Zenbook doesn't load windows anymore, suddenly stopped to recognize the storage, looking for warranty or return----------this was my previous review----------------Sold by Klick Online at $1029 at nov 24 2020. the model I received was the UM425IAOverall is great value for you money and is a great productCONS:it has no 3.5mm audio jack (but a Hi res audio dongle provided with the risk of losing it), only 1 conventional usbMyAsus app is buggy and sometimes loads after minutes if we are lucky, sometimes doesn't load.Occasionally (not so frequently) I hear interference while plugged the audio cable to the dongle and looking at streaming videos like youtube or coursera.I think this is a problem of avoiding that audio output standard.PRO: it's really fast, it turns on in 3-5 secondsit has win pro out of the boxAudio is by Harman/Kardon (not bang olufsen)

  I've been buying and building personal computers since 1982. I've seen them all. But, for my own computer, I too, am bound by a budget. My HP Pavilion laptop died, and I did not totally realize its flaws until I began using the Zenbook 14"". It's the first time in over 20 years that I picked an AMD processor, and Wow, what  blazing speed. I must confess, it was also the first time I bought a solid state drive in a personal computer. Another Wow!On the HP I expected a Win10 update to take from 30 minutes to 4 hours, and that was a Pentium from 2019. On the ASUS it takes LESS THAN A MINUTE.How about a REBOOT? Upwards to about 5 minutes on the HP before I could really begin work. 1-2 minutes MAXon the ASUS.  I really enjoy going to work again!The startup process from opening the box was the quickest I've experienced. And, flawless.Why did I spend double on this PC?  I read the specs on the RYZEN and it outdid the comparable INTEL. It was billed as a GAMER'S PC.  Folks, the most gaming I do is Words for Friends. I wanted a Thoroughbred!!Oh, did I mentioned it came with 16GB ram?  And 1TB solid state ever-so-fast drive?To be candid, when I started out decades ago it was the ASUS motherboard that went into the PC's I built. So, my confidence in them was high to begin with, but it turns out they outdid themselves.Would I recommend them?  Sure 'nuff!

  Required newer Linux kernel. The touchpad works but not the 10key or other gestures, I guess they made it work with added software on windowz instead of the bios.Battery life is great. I can't give an accurate measure yet as there hasn't been a full drain and recharge cycle in normal use, at about 6 hours it's around 70%

  Excellent performance. Battery life Is amazing, over 4 hours of heavy usage, 8+ with light browsing.Good looking laptop.Cost 30% less than an Intel, you get better battery life and more sdd space.

  Initially, I was happy with the item. However, within 2 weeks the battery wouldn't charge over 6% and I couldn't use the laptop unless it was plugged in. These things happen and although I wasn't happy that this happened I ran into issues trying to return the item as well. I got charged $411.10 for a re-stocking fee (which doesn't make sense the product was defective) and had to take extra measures to ensure I got a full refund. Additionally, I tried to have the item replaced instead of refunded prior to submitting for a refund but that option wasn't available.

  The computer stopped charging one week after use. It also was annoying to not have a earphone plug and the calculator keypad was always coming on when I didn't want it to. Just get a more expensive laptop. It's not worth the hassle.

  The weight, size, processing power, battery life, and cost for this were as close to perfect as I could ask for at around $1000 mark.

  When I bought this laptop I thought I was getting a good deal for a 120Hz display and a gtx 1650 I thought this would be perfect for playing esports titles on the go. I read other reviews and they said that the battery life was pretty poor which was a concern of mine, but I thought that I would be able to set the display to 60Hz on battery and 120Hz when plugged in to save battery.Turns out that the display is powered by the integrated intel graphics and not the gtx 1650, which means you cannot use the geforce settings utility to set a custom display resolution.  It also turns out that the gtx card is only really used for game speedups, but all graphics still need to be pumped back through the intel integrated gpu, since it is hard attached to the display. This means you will take a bit of a performance hit when using the gtx 1650 over using it as the dedicated card.Anyway not a deal breaker yet, I thought this wasn't a big deal as long as I could still use the intel display utils to set a custom display resolution to achieve either 60Hz or 90Hz to save battery when not gaming. Turns out that the intel driver is actually a custom asus driver, and only allows you to set the display to either 45Hz or 120Hz, anything else in between will return an error message. Trying to install the latest stock driver will also fail. So it looks like Asus locked down the display and made it so you have to use 120Hz or 45Hz which looks terrible.Using the machine just for internet browsing would go through the battery in around 2 hours, and this is even after I disabled the hard disk drive to save energy. Not worth it, especially seeing as the machine is really not that slim compared to machines like the xps 15 which have a way larger battery.I ended up returning the machine as it does not fit my needs. If you use this machine always plugged in I think it is a great deal and the 120Hz display is very nice, but I need to be able to get at least 4 - 5 hours of battery life from a laptop. There was no battery life rating anywhere listed on the amazon page and it turns out to only get around 2 hours when not even gaming.

  I landed on this laptop after much research and trying a few other models. I have the i7-9750H with GTX 1650, 16GB RAM variant of this product (K571-EB76)There are some excellent reviews already here on this product, so I'm not going to cover everything. I'm just going to mention the things that I wanted to know about this laptop that I wasn't able to find in the reviews.1. Vents - The version I have (GTX 1650) has vents on the bottom of the laptop, the bottom vent takes up about half of the bottom of the laptop.The entire back of the laptop is a huge vent. Under load, the fans are loud, but as loud as you'd expect a gaming laptop to be.2. Thermals - IDLE and while GAMING - Out of the box, this laptop likes to hang around 45C while idling and would sustain around 85-95C while gaming (I was playing Bioshock Remastered, not a very demanding game).Undervolting the CPU and GPU with ThrottleStop are going to be essential if you intend to game with this device. I currently have undervolting set to -125mV for both CPU and CPU Cache, and around -50mV for the GPU, and I disabled Turbo for the CPU entirely. This brought temps under load (DOOM on HIGH settings, 100-120 frames per second) to around 70C. I intend to purchase a laptop cooler as well to help manage temps.While typing this review (1 chrome window open), my temps are around 35CUsing ThrottleStop is incredibly easy and user-friendly. I highly suggest it to anyone that would take the time to read this review. Use this article as a guide to setup your laptop - https://www.ultrabookreview.com/10167-laptop-undervolting-overcloking/ - This goes for ANY laptop, not just this one. If you aren't undervolting your gaming laptop, you very likely might be doing it wrong.In terms of a gaming machine, I am incredibly impressed. It runs DOOM on HIGH incredibly smooth. I haven't tested other, more graphically demanding games with this device, but what I've thrown at it so far it has been great.3. Style/Looks - The case is plastic. It has a nice feel to it, and the color is quite nice (navy chassis, navy trackpad, matte black keys) - It's not an ""eye-catching"" laptop, but under the hood it's a beast, which I really like about it.  This is a gaming laptop that I won't feel embarrassed to take into work meetings. It has an understated and classic style that is respectable.The case does show fingerprints, grease (not the worst I've seen however). Keep a microfiber cloth in your bag to wipe it off after each use and you'll be fine.4. Keyboard - Adjustable backlight, very comfortable to type on. I really enjoy typing on this keyboard.5. Screen/Panel - Yes it is 120Hz and it is glorious. It's anti-glare. I have no idea about colors, I don't do much photo or video work normally. The screen looks great.6. What it's NOT: Sometimes this is just as important as what it is - - it doesn't have a touch screen - it's not a 2-in-1 - it does not have great battery life - it's not a super-light and thin laptopAnyway, those are my thoughts on this machine after owning it for a few days. If my opinion of this machine changes, I'll come back to this review and update it.Thanks for reading! Hopefully this helps some of you out there!

  I'm not of a reviewer, but I really enjoy this laptop. I use it for class and for doing work and it gets everything done for me. I really enjoy the screen and the features installed on it. This PC is lightning fast and I haven't had any issues with it. The PC seems to be capable of running most games including GTA 5 and I think that showcases the PC's capabilities.Pros:Fast SSDAmazing ScreenLightweightGreat GPU and CPUCons:Battery life could be better. If you use chrome a lot for your browsing, it will eat a lot of the battery and it might go down to 50% in an hour with chrome.

  This review is for the ASUS Zenbook Flip 13 UX363EA-XH71T.Pros:Great packaging, start up/set up was easy. Very thin and sleek! Processor speed and applications are fast. Quiet fan. Screen quality is excellent. Barely hear it when it‚Äôs doing major updates. The fan is not operational when it‚Äôs in ‚Äútablet mode‚Äù. (The screen will actually prompt that to you when you FLIP the keyboard half BACK). The screen can be ‚Äútouch screen ‚Äù while in laptop mode as well.Versatility-best of both worlds. Laptop and can become tablet. 2 birds 1 stone.It does come with a stylus that clips on magnetically. There IS also included a sleek  simple ‚Äúenvelope-like‚Äù laptop sleeve to store or travel in,  ASUS USB 3.0 to RJ45 Dongle to connect an Ethernet cable and a HDMI Hi-Res Audio cable adapter (female end) as well as the power adapter.Con: so far my only one.... there is not a SINGLE CASE PROTECTOR out there for this device that I can find!!! (If you know one please let me know) When you flip back to tablet mode...the keyboard is just out there. You hold it like a tablet and you mash buttons. Granted, while in ‚Äútablet mode‚Äù, the keyboard seems to be deactivated, but still, the issue remains.  Can‚Äôt put some sort of a sleeve over that bottom half unless it has cut-out for vents on bottom that‚Äôs for the fan?  (In case a person accidentally had it in laptop mode and now it‚Äôs burn it out because fan/vents were blocked not getting due to sleeve) So there‚Äôs a market for this dilemma (anyone interested in giving a go)

  I am in love with this computer. I went from having a heavy and bulky laptop to this and it is great! So much desk space! It's easy to pick up and move with one hand and a coffee in the other. The video  quality is good. I am using it for teaching on video and it has been great so far. There have been no problems my first week in. Just make sure to follow the directions in the little start up booklet they give you. Love the pen! It definitely makes drawing on the white board for class way easier.  You can fold it back and forth without worries, at least to me it doesn't feel like it's going to break. It's so tiny and lightweight I can't wait to take it traveling. There are less ports and no port for the ethernet cable nor headphones. However a USB C headphone jack adaptor and USB C Ethernet adaptor are included in the package. A nice carrying cover is included too for taking your laptop on the go. There aren't as may ports as I'd have liked however it is sufficient and does it's job. Great for studying! I can take it back and forth from places I wish to study very easily. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Definitely the most expensive thing I have ever bought but so far it has been worth it.

  I bought on April 14, 2021 and it is a great PC, but over-priced for the reasons belowI am using the laptop for work and only two issues which are show-stoppers for me:1. with 70% screen brightness I am getting less than 6 hours battery before it goes into battery saving mode so not a full-shift device unless on external power - my old surface pro 4 lasted a full shift2. Cannot sit the laptop on my lap - hot enough to do some damage, so that makes it a desktop, not a laptopUnit has to go back - too bad - can't imagine it will go the distance running this hot

  I really wanted to like this computer. It had all the ports I needed. The screen was not that great to me. Seems grainy. I sent the first one back thinking something was wrong with it. The second one same thing, I tried to download drivers to update it and it keep crashing on me. I was able to restore it back to a original point. Now it won‚Äôt install turbo tax so back to Amazon the second one goes again.

  Smaller than I thought it would be but set it up and had it running for my office in about 2 hours, love it. Quick and responsive, ASUS has really never disappointed me. Took a little longer than I expected to get to me but no retailers had them in stock anywhere close to me. Only thing I wish is it had at least 1 more USB port.

  I love this laptop. The OLED screen is great if you have issues with flickering light or led induced headaches like I do. THOUGH they don't mention anywhere that the pen needs a battery. So, yeah, the back of the pen comes off and needs a battery to work, there you go.

  Beautiful to look at.  Light weight and picture is great.  But it is so sensitive, typing is difficult.  Drops stars or numbers in the middle of words or erases words already typed.  If you pause while typing, it will often start adding a string of numbers.  Microsoft Edge often closes without warning and you have to start over.  If you are scanning an article and using touch screen, touch screen stops and you have to revert to your mouse or touch pad to continue.  Number pad on touch pad seems like a neat idea but, even when uninstalled in Device Manager, manages to re-install during updates. Sent first Asus I received back because of these issues -- thought I got a lemon.  Replacement has same issues.  Asus says nothing is wrong with the computer--my complaints are unusual. High priced piece of junk.

  The display is amazing.  The machine is fast but with only 16GB RAM it can't be used for creative work.

  Yikes.I can't even watch videos on YouTube. The video box goes totally black at random, and the sound quality is terrible.Furthermore, the mouse pad is worse than the one on the old laptop I just replaced; it will randomly stop working or cause me to click on something I didn't want/mean to. This has been causing me some serious inconveniences. I'm just lucky I thought to get an external mouse, in that I can at least use this thing for stuff. It only makes it super inconvenient for when I'm trying to use this laptop in a place where I don't have a flat surface.It's a major blow, since I spent more money on this laptop than I've spent on any laptop, and I got something worse than I've ever gotten, in terms of buying something brand-spankin'-new? So, I outright regret getting this thing. I really, really do.If you want to know the positive things, the startup time is great and I'm able to run a ton of things all at once without it ""complaining"" at me. The battery life is acceptable.Less positive note: The battery life isn't super accurate, in spite of how I uninstalled and reinstalled Windows in an attempt to fix that problem (so, I'm feeling like it's the battery itself, not Windows, at this point).So, I guess I'll be trying to get my money back!

  Product is a good value with a good processor and GPU. Should have 16gb minimum so you have to buy another 8gb stick for 40 bucks. Only have the 512 gb nvme SSD but does have the bracket and screws for adding additional storage you may have laying around. My problem was the seller NexiPC the laptop was shipped in an oversized box that outside was not damaged. The Laptop box inside was beaten up badly. Laptop has a noisy GPU fan. They authorized a return for refund but I would have to pay shipping. They also would not just exchange it. I would have to send back the laptop, the extra memory I purchased and wait for the refunds to purchase another. I would be out around 60 bucks in shipping! Decide to buy a replacement fan set from China for 23 bucks and call it a wash. Laptop works great, just noisier than it should be. Unhappy with the return policies of NexiPC.

  Bought this laptop during black Friday. I bought it mainly to play the Sims and a few other games (no fps games). There are some problems with it which is why I didn't rate it 5 stars. The number lock doesn't light up, so I have to constantly press the button; there really should be some light to indicate the number lock is on. I remember reading a review that said the mousepad isn't very good either. It's true, you're better off having a separate mouse. Sound quality is kinda bad unless you have headphones connected. Sound is great through headphones. For the price I bought it, it's a good laptop overall. Especially for a laptop under $1000. I'm not sure how it plays with fps games.

  I bought this gaming laptop primarily for my astrophotography needs & after 6-weeks of use have not been disappointed. Got it at black Friday/cyber Monday pricing which made it a great bargain. I spent many hours researching laptops before selecting this one. Made a bad choice a couple of years ago & didn't want a repeat.With it having a separate GPU, the graphics are superb. Some of the best I've seen on a laptop. An excellent match for my photo processing needs! I also opted for the Intel processor as I wanted more horsepower & it zooms!Was pleasantly surprised to see open room for another hard-drive which I quickly filled with one I had on-hand. Maybe I overlooked this in the specs but don't recall seeing it. I also added another 8-GB of ram as one of my photo apps needed more room to work.My only negative comment is with regards to the battery so subtracted 1-star. It only lasts about 3-hours from the 80% charge which is recommended by Asus in order to maximize long term battery life. Being a gaming set-up it does have 2-fans so that is somewhat expected but thought it would do a little better. Haven't tested yet from a 100% charge. Think I'll bump it to 100% with the included Asus app for any planned outings where I won't have access to power.

  This review is for the Asus 15.6/HD with inteli7-9750H, GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB DDR4:  I really enjoy ASUS laptops and this one, for the price, exceeds my expectations..  Great graphics, light weight, works well.  Not trying to promote ASUS products but have found them to be dependable over the years.  This one, I think I enjoy the most out of all those I had purchased..  Saying this because it is light weight, easy KB and works as well as my more expensive systems.  I did add more RAM as this is only 8 GB.  (IT will take up to 32 GB).  Display is clear and everything worked well when arrived.  I upgraded the drivers, (some can upgrade in windows, Nvidia, go to their web site), and things tended to flower more.  Especially for the price, this is a great little machine!

  I swore I'd never again buy an Asus but this is a very attractive laptop and I decided to give Asus another shot. Asus lost me as a customer due to their awful mouse drivers in the past. Few things are more frustrating than a jumpy mouse when you're trying to get work done. When I buy a laptop, I mainly care about five things: Display, weight, mouse, battery life, and keyboard.This notebook has a pretty good (Not amazing) matte, non-touch display, very little backlight bleed and great viewing angles. This is absolutely NOT a 400 nit display, it seems to be around 250 nits - 7 out of 10.At 2.58 pounds, the weight is a little heavier than I'd like - 7 out of 10.The large, glass trackpad on this mouse is absolutely spectacular, one of the best I've ever used - 10 out of 10Battery life is very good. Mine measures at 67.962 Wh. I'd say that 10 hours is reasonable to expect with light to normal use - 8.5 out of 10The keyboard is also very good, decent 1.4mm travel and a nice actuation, great backlight - 8 out of 10Some helpful details: Keyboard backlight has three brightness levels. Keyboard backlight stays on for 1 minute before automatically turning off due to inactivity. The keyboard backlight DOES turn back on when you move the mouse. Asus is well known for awful mouse drivers contributing to a jumpy mouse but I'm (thankfully) not seeing that with this laptop so far. As ridiculous as this is, you can't actually upgrade the RAM in this laptop. You're stuck with what's soldered on the motherboard - unintelligible.I may, however, end up returning this laptop due to a slight, barely audible electric noise coming from the motherboard. If you've ever had an XPS you may know what I'm talking about. Dells are famous for this garbage and I was surprised to hear this on an Asus. An ignominious issue with an otherwise great laptop.

  I got this to replace my 7 year old Surface Pro. I wanted a light light laptop, support for WIF6, faster USB ports and WPA3. This fits the bill.. At 2.5 lbs it is easy to balance on my lap. I use it mostly to surf the web and do some spread sheet work. The keyboard has a nice feel to it. The increased battery life is nice since my old laptop battery was requiring recharging more often as is expected. Right now I am getting about 22 hours per charge. I also like the crisp monitor (full HD), It is about the size off my old LAPTOP but with a larger display. Setup was simple and once configured immediately connected to the internet at  WFI6 speeds and used WPA3 security. The only con I can think of I wish they had placed one Thunderbolt 4 USB on each side since my wall socket is on the right. The backlit keyboard is nice in a darkened room. The sleeve is a nice addition and protects the notebook. I am very happy with my purchase and would buy it again. It reflected ASUS attention to detail and quality. I like the military-grade durability.

  I spent a lot of time trying to pick a laptop I'd be happy with performance.  Many low cost laptops use lower capacity microprocessors so I wanted to make sure this one had plenty of horsepower.  This one comes with an 11th generation i7 from intel with plenty of power and speed and offers sluggish free performance.  No disappointment so far even after setting up AV software.This product presents well from first opening of the box to first boot of the computer.  The computer comes well equipped with a nice sleeve to protect from scratches, a USB ethernet dongle and USB C based power supply.  The written instruction manual is sparse but really isn't needed as the computer pretty much sets itself up once powered on.  Be prepared to present your Microsoft and other platform credentials.  Best to do this at home so you can connect to Wi-Fi from the start and update and register from the beginning.It doesn't seem to come with too much bloatware but does include a trial for McAfee and Office 365.  First boot was quite seamless and gives a chance to trial O365 or connect with an existing account.  I already had a subscription to O365 and it connected me seamlessly to my account and started downloading files from my OneDrive without any extra steps.  This was wonderful.  Unfortunately linking to my McAfee account wasn't as seamless but not difficult, it just took a few manual steps.  It would be nice if McAfee would make this part seamless too.As for hardware, the keyboard is a good size for a 14 inch with solid key clicks.  The mousepad/second screen is unique and takes a little getting used to.  Since the mini-screen doubles as a mousepad, you may find that you spend a little time enabling/disabling the screen vs. touchpad but after a while it becomes second nature.  With an external mouse, this goes away.  You can assign arbitrary apps to open on the mini-screen which can be useful but requires the right app.  Its good for things like YouTube, Netflix and other media types.  Like any second screen, apps can also be dragged from one screen to the other.The laptop also supports Thunderbolt interface.  This allows other devices to be connected to the laptop like external drives, screens and other devices through a single docking port.  It also supports charging through the Thunderbolt port.  The provided charger is based on USB C and the simple quick start guide indicates the PC can be powered from 5-20 volts.Overall, very pleased with this laptop and can recommend.  Its small and lightweight, <3 lbs, yet comes with plenty of compute power and includes a nice built in second screen.

  This is a bargain laptop. The core I7 8550U Kaby-Lake processor is the same one you'll find in most high-end laptops these days, and better that the Y processors in the new macbook air. It has a generous number of connections; full size HDMI, USB 3, Usb2.1 and USB-C (3.1 specs), along with a Micro-SD slot and a 3.5mm headphone /microphone jack. The screen is a non-touch 1080P and a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader. All in a 2.6 lb (by my scale) aluminum package.  I have read some criticism of the keyboard, but personally I find it as good as any laptop keyboard and have no complaints. But, I do not write novels or technical manuals for a living so my typing is pretty basic and your mileage may vary. The down-firing Harmon Kardon branded speakers are OK. But in my opinion, people who insist on blasting there speakers for sound either live alone or don't mind annoying people around them. I have always preferred headphones.Needless to say, for a laptop that is almost $400 cheaper than its rivals, there are some compromises. The screen is only HD and not the current QHD on most higher-priced laptops. But seriously, it is a 13"" screen. The text on 1080P is already tiny for my bifocal wearing eyes, how small would it be at 2560? That's not a deal breaker for me. The USB-C does not support power or display port.  You still need the (standard ASUS) Power adapter to plug it in. There is only a 256GB SSD option and it is SATA-III. Finally it only comes with Win-10 Home, a Core I7 should have Pro.  I did spend the money for a Pro upgrade.All things considered, it is hard not to like this laptop. For a light weight easy to transport laptop it is excellent The I7 CPU provides plenty of power for almost any portable use. The machine powers up quickly and smoothly, the fingerprint reader works flawlessly (for me).  For my use, I just could not justify paying an extra $350 - 400 for a similarly spec'd laptop. And I have had excellent experiences with Asus products. this laptop is an more than adequate replacement for my 6 year old desktop and laptop combo.

  ¬†What a waste of money .  Screen started flickering after 2 weeks.  What makes it even worst my daughter bought it and took it to England where she lives.  Now they are saying to me we have to pay shipping cost back to the U.S.*UPDATE* They will now refund shipping costs from UK to US, but won't pay return costs back to UK despite the International shipping being available on the item...  She paid for an item, its defective, can't use it and loses money each day it cannot be used.  Now expected to pay shipping cost to have a replacement item, without any guarantee that the same issue won't occur...

  My priorities in searching for a laptop were as follows: good brand, low emission (meaning low heat and low noise), MATTE display (because the common glossy displays reflect way too much light), HD monitor, >8GB RAM and a Solid State Drive. I spent a lot of time reviewing newegg, bestbuy and amazon for top sellers, along with pcreviews and notebookcheck dot net (which does incredible detailed reviews showing how much heat and noise a laptop generates). I settled on this notebook and am very happy with what I got. The 2018 version is definitely worth the extra $50 over the 2017 version because the bezel (plastic border around the screen) is much smaller resulting in a laptop that is 10% smaller than the 2017 version while maintaining a 13"" screen! The faint high pitched noise put out by the motherboard is only detectable in a silent room when you place your head within 12"" of the keyboard. The battery life is stellar. Under load, the system hardly generates any heat and under light use (browsing/Word), I never hear the fan kick in. This 8th generation i5 is much more powerful than older i7 CPU's. It's incredibly thin. I was worried about the laptop looking 'gold' but it doesn't - it looks very silver with a faint hue. Very fast start-ups - I press the power button from hibernation and by the time I moved my finger to the fingerprint, I'm up and running within 2 seconds. Fully recommend.

  In my recent quest to find a good laptop for my work, I have tried about 8 different ones (I have tried 5 different Asus laptops - Vivobooks and Zenbooks) ad found every Asus laptop to be glitchy.Seriously, I wonder why the hell can Asus not build a laptop that is not so glitchy. Feels like an amateur built them. Touchpad glitches are very common with Asus laptops and on this laptop, the screen also flashes red/blue suddenly and then disappears.So why did I try so many Asus laptops if they're super glitchy? Because everything else about them is perfect - the screen size, the SSD, the matte finish, speakers, and the super quiet fan noise... I was hoping that I'd find one without a glitch, but that hasn't happened yet... each one of the Asus laptops glitched in some way.

  This laptop has been great to me so far! So much faster and smoother than my old pc! Lightning fast with loading, and refreshes! I haven't done a whole lot of gaming yet to be honest, but with the causal stuff that I already had on steam before purchasing this pc, it runs great, and hardly any lag! Main drawback is that the cooling fans do get quite loud at times, particularly when playing games for a while, but I got noise cancelling headset to help with that. Overall, I'm loving this thing! For a gaming pc in the lower price range, this is really good in my opinion!

  My wife and I have ASUS RogueStrix notebooks and wanted something a little more ""Tuf"" for the kids. So far these have been great and hold up the their name.  Power is decent enough to play most current games. No ray-tracing means the price is right if you don't need the latest and greatest.Pro: Backlit Keyboard, solid performance, well built, crisp display.Cons: Power adapter gets HOT (be careful), Battery life is decent if you are just browsing the web but we find you must remain plugged in to get full performance when gaming.

  An amazing laptop. I replace the eight gigs of RAM for 32 gigs. To increase the FPS on most games. You can expand the memory with a thin HDD Hard drive or an SSD. The cpu and gpu stays nice and cool.  This id The kind of quality expect from my favorite brand Asus. Especially since it‚Äôs so hard to find a decent desktop. Right now I cannot find a gpu that is not overpriced right now. This laptop is affordable and has good specs. However the ram must be updated.

  Build quality seems OK but not too confident. Fan noise happens where expected on a decent secure install of programs and is 7/10 on how bad noise is, that is if your looking for that silent of an experience, otherwise it's tolerable for average applications.

  I have been using this laptop for just over 30 days and here is my feedback:PRO's:GREAT battery life (12+ hours consistently in normal use with power bar at max)GREAT build qualityVERY thin and lightGREAT Price to Performance ratioHinge Lift on screen definitely improves coolingIt is a really premium looking laptop in person and definitely looks high end for the priceCON'sFan noise is a bit too much compared to a surface or xps 13 (there is a silent mode but drops boost clock to 2.8)No touch screen (if you are into that sort of thing, I am not personally)Boost clock is a bit low when on battery (3.9g) compared to chip performance (underclocked to save power)Screen does not go full 90 degrees open which I like for laying in bed or on the sofa (but it works just fine, I am just being picky because it is a review)User Case:I am a computer hardware enthusiast.  I much prefer desktop PC's to laptops so when I set out to purchase a laptop for myself I did quite a bit of research.  For me a laptop is not for gaming but for doing work, browsing the internet, watching video and updating social media.  I wanted a machine that was lightweight, powerful enough to open large excel spreadsheets, had enough memory to manage a massive outlook .dat file had a good screen for watching video and had great battery life so I did not need to carry a charger with me.  Also, I wanted a machine that would charge using USB-C vs a barrel plug and power brick.  I also wanted thunderbolt in order to doc into my station in my office (at some point when we ever go back).  I found all of these things in this machine for under 1k.I was fully expecting to pay 1700 or more to find a machine that I liked and I was very surprised to find an intel ice lake powered machine for this price point.  I was concerned that only having 8g of ram was going to be an issue as 16g would be what I consider minimum acceptable levels.  So far this has not been an problem, even on larger excel files but then bear in mind I do not have a bunch of apps installed on this machine, mostly just MS office and Minecraft (which the iris graphics runs just fine btw).  This machine performs great, runs everything I need it to and I feel I am getting a dell XPS build quality and user experience for a lot less money.  I like the larger XPS-ish track pad and the integrated num pad is also nice.  While you are not going to do any AAA gaming on this machine that is not what you buy a thin and light to do (or really any laptop at all regardless of the marketing).  All in all I would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking to buy a good performing thin and light laptop in 2020 even with the upcoming tiger lake releases.

  Laptop is very fast and runs quiet. Good feel typing and has a very good display. Excellent battery life. Only problem is while I can plug many things into my USB C ports at one time, if I plug in my USB C headphones, even while nothing else is plugged in, I get a ""not enough resources"" warning and while I can hear through the headphones and control the volume, it won't recognize the mic so I can't use it for calls. Need to find a way around that.Update: I bought an inexpensive pair of 3.5 mm headphones and used the adaptor provided by Asus. It works very well.

  Great laptop. Great battery life when you put on a conservative setting. Really wish it would have come with 16GB ram. Another disappointment is in the sleeve. ASUS really dropped the ball on this. My 2012 ASUS ux31 came with an amazing sleeve. This new one is poor quality and oversized. You can tell it‚Äôs  a generic ‚Äúone size fits all type‚Äù. Come on ASUS you know better.

  This is an excellent Laptop, it is incredibly lightweight, small (smaller than a lot of 13"" Laptops) and has great battery life and battery retention.  The display is very bright with great colors, very responsive, Facial recognition for logon is fast and reliable (Windows 10).  I like the USB-C charging and using the Micro SD card reader to add another 256 GB or data storage.  The Speakers sound good enough for me to listen to music on it but prefer earbuds.  I highly recommend this laptop for everything but Gaming and maybe High Res Video Editing.On the down side, my last Laptop had a touch screen and I really miss not being able to control the screen, I could have bought an Asus with touch, but not at this price point.  I wish there was a 16GB and 1TB SSD option for this product, I would bought that one.  Overall for the price point, I am very happy with the purchase and would buy it again.

  Attracted to the small size and battery power.  I have no intention to buy a tablet after using this, it meets all my requirements.  Really love the size / feel of it. Granted I plug into external monitor, keyboard, and mouse when working from home for full days.Had a few issues with my first one that amazon replaced ASAP.1) fan reved high for no apparent reason (CPU % <15%)2)  video playback lagged despite excellent download speed3) 3.5mm dongle had a weird chirping sound when on zoom or anything that required audio in/out.The replacement Amazon sent me fixed the first two issues but not the third.  After calling tech support they sent me a replacement dongle at no costs, and that resolved the chirping problem.  At this point I'm very happy with this laptop, but giving it 4 stars because it took about two months to get right.This is the replacement dongle I'm using:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K25P3N1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1UPDATE -The second one amazon sent me has a very loud click on the touch pad.  I figured I'd tolerate it but it seems to get worse.  Further, I just upgraded to airpods and they barely hold a connection with it.  Not sure if the issue is the air pods or the laptop, but eitherway, not very happy.

  Near perfect laptop with this price range.

  Requirements everyone should have when looking for a laptop.Processor = i5 or i7 (Some AMD's are OK too)Ram = 8GB or higherHarddrive = SSD with additional hard-drive slotPorts = HDMI, VGA and/or Display PortUSB = 3 or more ports with USB 3.0Battery = removable battery and/or 2nd battery slotDisplay = 1920 x 1080 resolution (Not 4K yet because of support and text size)Graphics = Intel Graphics AND Dedicated Graphics ChipThis laptopThis is one of my favorite laptops and meets my laptop standards. It has a wonderful solid design and additional NON standard features. I own two of them so I have experience with this model. I am able to play a video, have 20 Internet Explorer windows open and write an email at the same time with NO lag. Although I don't play any Super high performance games, any games I have played have been on the best video settings without lag or issues. I use this mostly for work and I work in the IT field so I'm constantly pushing this machine to its limits (or so I think). It has a fast SSD with expandable hard drive storage in the CD tray, includes 2 REMOVABLE batteries, has 8 GB of ram (this is really the minimum anyone should expect in a good laptop) and of course the Nvidia GT 840M graphics chip. The benefit of having a laptop like this with a dedicated Graphics chip is that the system will automatically decide whether to use the Intel on-board Graphics card (yes this system has both and the on-board one uses less battery) and the dedicated Nvidia Graphics (means more performance) This means you don't have to use the GFX chip for simple games like Tetris or PacMan or browsing the internet. When you load a high performance game this system knows to run the Nvidia Chip which means better performance. Of course you can tell the system what to use with what games/software if you so choose.Conclusion: This is a great all around laptop that includes features that are not standard on other similar prices laptops you find at Staples or Bestbuy. Two stand out features are the 2nd battery and expanded hard-drive slot.

  So far so good! As this is a laptop this review will be longer but I will try to explain all of my gripes as they are pretty small.The processor is a little on the slow side but you are looking at a laptop that can last for 3-4 hours on battery with constant use. The battery life is worth more to me than the speed. This computer is by no means slow though. Much of that is due to the SSD that comes with the computer though. The RAM is an acceptable amount and the SSD is fairly well sized. The computer I received came with a caddy for a secondary HDD which is nice. The SSD is a MSATA for anyone who might want to replace the HDD.There is a good wireless card inside and so far reception has not been an issue. I have also not tested it for distance but it has been very speedy thus far. No dropping of signal or any other negative aspects. The Bluetooth is a little buggy but it connects well enough. I think this has more to do with the Windows 10 drivers.There are 2 batteries to this laptop which is a huge plus. If you need to carry a charged spare it is fairly easy to swap while the computer is on. I will probably never need to do this however I cannot tell the future so it's a plus nonetheless. As I said before with no power adjustments it was reading 3 hours of battery life. I imagine that with tweaking another hour can be added.The build of this computer is really solid. I like the feel of the computer in my hands. However it's not too heavy either. The lid does not flex and the keyboard is firm under your hands. The palm rest is aluminum however most of the case is plastic. The square edges look strange to me but that's pure aesthetics.The keyboard is nice to type on but isn't perfect. The keys feel like they are spread out a little farther than they have to be. However for a laptop the keyboard is fine. If you are sitting and typing 3k words in a sitting I would recommend getting another keyboard though.The screen and graphics feel snappy and perform well. I haven't thrown any games at it but it seems like it will perform well. I'm not a big gamer but it does have a dedicated video card so that's good news.The security features are a great final cherry on top. It has a built in fingerprint reader which is nice for quick security access but to up things a little more you can utilize a smart card with the built in smart card reader. This would be a great single solution for a small or medium sized business portable computing.This is my one and only gripe. If you want to upgrade the memory, HDD, or wireless card you have to remove the entire bottom of the computer. Why they didn't do doors in the bottom to make it easy I have no idea but it shouldn't be a problem if you know what you're doing. I wanted to upgrade the hard drive to a 500gb and thought it was an m.2 slot. It is an msata. No big deal but I wish I would have known this in advance. Not even worth taking a star off. I do wish that I could find the cable for the internal spinning HDD but I have searched high and low for one and have come up empty. I have always been a fan of having a SSD for the OS and a HDD combination for files. I am just doing the SSD and then when I need file storage I will use the caddy provided with the computer. However if ASUS has one I would be very interested in adding that to the computer. The internal storage to the chassis has the capability to have a 2.5"" drive inside.Overall this is a great computer to own especially for the price! I highly recommend this product even with the small complaints that I had. There will never be a perfect computer for everyone but for me this one comes very close. I hope to utilize this computer for a long while. If you added a touch screen added this would be a great future proof solution.

  Bought this unit and ""assumed"" if would be functional when rec'd. It was NOT!Returned the unit (3) days after receiving it to ASUS for repair under warranty. It's been (31) days since then and I still do not have a laptop. Been getting the run-around by ASUS service/repair. ASUS has apologized every step in the process.....but that does not get me a product that I can use. ASUS offered a replacement upgrade but that did not happen either. Still waiting. I get no updates, as promised. I have to call a every couple days and spend time asking for updates or any other info pertinent to the repair status. I requested ASUS simply return the unit to me so I may return it to AMAZON for credit and buy another unit from anyone other than ASUS.I will never do business with ASUS again.

  Laptops have made great advances in the past few years. This is a good example of waiting for the right one to come along. I am using this 17""  ASUS Gaming Laptop for my desktop recording sessions at the home studio. I chose it for the 16 GB and 256 GB SSHD, and 1 TB HD upgrades. Let me say ""Rock Solid"". The upgrades allow me record from another computer to the laptop with no delays or glitches one might experience with lesser components.The 17"" screen is easy on the eyes and GREAT for editing and watching HD videos. Side by side with my studio HDTV, the laptop is sharper, crisper, and has better color. The facial tones are more realistic than my HD TV. That's probably due to the 4 GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics included in the unit. The sound is great for watching movies up close. I have the setting at 56% and it is loud enough to enjoy the movie. I put the volume up to 100 but it was unnecessary. Also, I noticed there is no cracking or rumbling in the speakers at a high volume while watching the movie. I do not use the laptop speakers for my work of music/video  editing. I use KRK Rokit 5 Desktop monitors for that. The unit has a combination mic/speaker 1/8"" analog input jack for audio use. I have to plug and unplug the different jacks in to use the external pro studio monitors on the desk. I am holding back the 5th star for that reason. I will order a usb to mic adapter to compensate for the design. I'm sure other people might not use the Laptop as I do and NOT find an issue with the missing mic port.The laptop is not short on usb ports, which another reason why I chose this particular unit. I was especially concerned with the ethernet RJ45 port that is not included in some other newer laptops. In my field of professional music I need to know that I am connected by ethernet hardwire to the outside world. Because I use a digital format for work I need the hardwire and not the WiFi for full assurance of transmission. The WiFi works well with my wireless printer and a couple of other devices.As far as a gaming computer, it's not my purpose for having this unit. BUT, the fact that it can handle pro use music editing and video editing tasks effortlessly says a lot about this unit. It does not get hot using it as I do, and I do not hear the fan turn on like when I used my wife's other brand laptop, with lesser ram and lesser CPU power, for the same tasks.This is a Windows 10 x64bit Operating system. The editing software I use needs that and still another reason for selecting this unit. I was surprised at the syncing features this unit had while setting it up. After setting up it looks like my desktop, minus a lot of app icons, but having the same wallpaper, mail, and a few other synced apps. The setup was effortless and without issue. I typed my email address and the software took it from there.So, let's talk about the units outer features. It's flat black which looks nice on MY desk and not out of place as a silver or other bright color might look while I'm trying to concentrate on my work. (No distraction). A lot of musicians work in dim lighting, more for concentration than effect. This brings me to the LED backlit keyboard. It has an app that allows you to choose what kind of lighting you want on your keyboard. The colors follow the whole spectrum so you can really customize it to your liking. Also, you can choose a mode if you would like to rotate colors or areas that are lit. Very nice feature. I have mine on a static soft blue/gray. It's just enough to see where to place my hands in the dimly lit studio. Very cool.If I were going to carry it around I might be concerned with the weight as it is slightly heavy being a 17"" laptop FULL PC. I do plan to carry it occasionally to some events but not daily, so the weight is not a problem for me. Again, this is a professional musician TOOL for me, so I spent accordingly. It will pay for itself and I need for it to last a long time.Because I plan to take it with me to some events away from the studio and house, I also bought the 3 year accident plan. I have full confidence in ASUS products. I bought the ASUS for the brand. I currently have a ASUS desktop pc that I have been using for a few years without problems. It is my second ASUS desktop unit. I gave the first one away to my adult son, as I was upgrading to the one I have now. I find them trouble free for the hardware part of a computer system. My computer issues have only been software problems.All and all its a very good unit. But, its only been two days of use.

  Pros: the keyboard lightup is coolThe Cons: Worst laptop I have ever owned. The NVIDIA card drops all utilization and transfers it to the intel integrated chipset. This results in 1-5 seconds of nothing moving on screen. This is a death sentence in multiplayer games, but don't worry the geniuses at ASUS will insist that this ""load sharing"" is a feature not a bug. And it's not like this is just new multiplayer games on Ultra or whatever. Overwatch on low, the original battlefront 2 on low, Uplink, realm royale, Fortnite, GTA5, PUBG, Stellaris, Civ 4-6, The Witcher, Golf With Your Friends, High settings, low settings, doesnt matter! It fails on them all. But it won't fail until 2 months or so. Just long enough that with a little tech support you can't return it and build a desktop.

  I have been buying ASUS ROG computers for a very long time.  I am not a gamer, I use it for software development and general work but just need more horsepower than a standard laptop.I have had nothing but problems with this computer.  First, the ASUS driver that controls the keyboard LED color caused the system to constantly lock up.  ASUS support told me to completely re-load windows and was otherwise no help.  Of course, reloading Windows did not fix it.  I found and disabled the LED color driver and that did fix that problem after weeks of frustration.Now, I have a problem where, in the middle of working, the keyboard just stops responding.  Everything else stays fine, including the mouse.  I have to put the computer to sleep (killing all of my active sessions) and wake it up again to fix that.  I have a fully patched Windows 10 install.  ASUS is no help whatsoever.I will never buy another ASUS laptop again.

  I love this laptop so far. It is everything it is supposed to be. An inexpensive, introductory gaming laptop able to play games at medium graphics settings. I am personally using it for work (Data Analyst) and it is perfectly suited for C#, DB, and web development. Tons of RAM, processing power, and storage. The 256GB SSD is quick enough coming in at 500MB/s read and 480MB/s write (Sequential, 1GB file)(Image below as compared to my desktop RAID0 Sandisk Pros). The Display is crisp and bright. It is putting my other monitors on my desk to shame. Audio is excellent when tuned properly to your liking with the bundled Sonic Studio 3 software. Tuning will get you that clean, crisp loudness some of the others reviewers wanted.With that said, make no mistake, this IS a gaming laptop. I have snuck in some Mechwarrior Online, Diablo 3, and Just Survive so far and have zero complaints. I get my 60fps as I'd expect by using the Nvidia's GeForce Experience program.SSD Note:If you're thinking about buying this laptop and have never had a small SSD for your OS drive (C:), you need to understand data management. At first power on, you NEED to change the location of your user folders (Music, Downloads, Videos, etc.) excluding Desktop to the data drive (D:). The Desktop folder is a basic part of the OS and should be left alone. You also need to install programs to the data drive as often as possible. Only install drivers, system apps, and maybe a few heavily used games and programs of your choosing to the SSD as it will fill up fast.

  ¬†This computer is bad ass. I'm sure it'll be able to handle anything I need or want to do with ita... First off.. it arrived 6 days early.. I'm really impressed... Opened up the box and pulled out the beautiful Asus ROG box the computer comes in.. took the computer out and wow is it everything I was hoping for.. I love the RGB glow from the keyboard and underneath the chassis. I installed Doom just to test it out and it performed flawlessly... The 120hz display kicks ass... CPU is untouchable.. 5 star all day... I only have about 3 hours on the computer but it's perfect...  Thank you for a great product

  The battery life works great, and while the advanced settings it has taken a little getting used to, as I figure them out they're absolutely wonderful things to have access too. The only tiny thing I've noticed is that the keyboard is a little oversensitive so it double types keys sometimes but it's such a minor issue it doesn't really bother me. Overall a great system, especially for the price paid.

  I had an ASUS laptop for 6 years, a 2-in-1, but I unfortunately dropped something on it and cracked the entire screen. I had no other troubles with that laptop therefore I didn't really want to look at other brands. And especially after having this one for two weeks i'm not sure I ever will. I personally enjoy the cursor pad/whatever you wanna call it being to the right of the keyboard, the placement makes a lot more sense than the normal. I bought this laptop for the convenience of having split screens. It makes writing papers as a college student a lot easier. As well as taking notes. There's really no trouble with seeing the screen on the keyboard, unless your posture with it on your lap sucks and the angle causes a glare. Its also a bonus that the screens have separate adjustors for brightness. The quality overall is incredible. I've had no problem running multiple tabs, apps, etc. My only wish it that it came with a spot to put a stylus, but really not a big deal considering I have a pouch to carry the charger in.

  I hope I could love this laptop. I've already put a blue light blocker on it.. During the first week it just gets lost from internet connection when all my other devices are online. Then it just freezing frequently, I don't know how could I survive as a coder with a tool like it. I will return it hopefully for a full refund when covid-19 situation get better so I could go outside.

  The product came in great condition and had very secure packaging. The laptop overall was a great computer but the trackpad is small, so you need to purchase a separate mouse in order for the laptop to work at its fastest. At some point the trackpad didn't work anymore and the curser wouldn't show up, but the separate mouse I purchased for a couple of dollars worked perfectly fine. The battery life overall is ok and is considered short compared to other laptops that can be purchased for the same price. The material of the laptop was very smudgy and fingerprints could easily be seen from the case. The laptop size overall was pretty bulky and heavy with a small screen. The length of the screen was large but the width was pretty small.The multitasking feature works very well and I am very happy with how it functions. When you drag a tab to the second smaller screen, it sizes it perfectly so that you can see the tab and use it easily. You can have up the three tabs on the bottom screen and even more on the top. A function that I found to be very useful was how you could resize, drag, and drop the different tabs in different locations of the laptop. It was great for multitasking and I have no complaints in that area of the laptop. The touchscreen was like any other and works well with stylists. It is pretty much like a iPad or a touchscreen computer.Overall, it is a great product for work and school life where you need to be able to look at a lot of tabs at once.

  Basically what you have here is a laptop with an intel i7 10th. generation cpu with integrated Intel 630 graphics and two screens.  One screen is 14 inch and a smaller screen is below it.  The screens can be used as two separate screens or as one gigantic screen.  Applications can be moved easily between screens.  Both screens are touch and accept pen input [no pen included].  Battery life is excellent at about 8 hours of real use.  If this sounds useful to you, I would highly recommend it.  To me the negatives are:  1.  Lower screen needs to be tilted upward. 2.  Keyboard and trackpad a little awkward because of design.  Also wish they had used Intel Iris Plus graphics, usbc charging, and a Thunderbolt 3 port.  It's not perfect, but Asus did a really good job.

  ü§™ This is a Very well made Labtop that im proud to have. Build quality is superb.üíØ  The base has no wasted space. Touch pad has zoom in/out feature and one tap is also a click so you don't need to really use button left click if you don't want to (Cool feature) . I think the extra screen could be more brighter but I use both screens on dim to protect my eye anyways. Both screens are touch screen. Beautiful displays. Would be cool to have two different wallpapers but I dont think possible. You can use this bi screens as one big display but honestly I never got used to that gap (the hinge space) between screens Yet. I mean it still is usable as 1 big screen and I use a labtop stand so the base screen is angled more to me Which Does Help me view bottom easier and I never felt my labtop get hot yet to. I do highly recommend a stand. üëç iIts a good labtop, Unique experience that Does grow. Regular solo screened labtops is inferior in my own opinion after my short ownership of this Asus ( I got cheapest version of the line). Buy it, Learn it, Live it, Love it. ü§ó Aloha.

  I had fun putting a skin on it.We loved the unique design and extra touch screen. My son really really admired it. I ended up giving it to him. He probably wouldn't have picked it for himself, but he loves it. He says it works with among us and leaf blower revolution. Whatever that means.

  Love the fact that this has room for 3 NVMe drives. One mystery.... the drive on mine has Bitlocker encryption on the main drive but Bitlocker is only available on Windows 10 Pro.

  So I absolutely love this laptop. It‚Äôs by far the the best overall built laptop on the market that has power, battery life, portability, and build quality. Hands down.That being said there was one big issue with my laptop once I started playing around with it. After driver and windows all got updated. I started noticing blue screens on startup. Only sometimes. And it wasn't the same blue screen, it would pop up 3 different ones at random sometimes.So I noticed the only thing not update to the newest version was my bios. Thankfully I‚Äôve been building and working with computers for over a decade now and was familiar with doing this. Once done the problem still happened. So I ran out of logical options as I had no clue what to do with this brand new laptop. It worked perfectly after the blue screen went away and it restarted on its own. Like nothing ever happened.But I called asus and they had no idea either then recommended I reformat my brand new laptop I‚Äôve had for 12 days. With regret I had no choice at this point. So I went through the process of wiping the current operating system and redoing everything from scratch. Windows updates, driver updates, installing all the asus apps that work amazing on this specific computer.Finally got it done. Guess what? No more blue screens. So moral of this story is I‚Äôm not sure what asus is shipping these laptops with software wise. But I had issues out of the box on mine and ended up having to wipe it all and reformat from scratch. Now for me this isn‚Äôt a big deal. But some that are less knowledgeable vs me will struggle massively with this issue. So if some of what I‚Äôve said is confusing or your don‚Äôt understand, It‚Äôs not a set up and go type of experience I have had. But now it‚Äôs problem free and amazing as ever. I just wanted to share my experience and earn some people if your not tech savvy then you may be on the phone with asus for quite awhile having them teach you how to reformat over the phone or be forced to send it in for repairs and be without your new laptop for weeks. Also got this laptop for 1300$ R9 cpu and 2060 1tb ssd 16gb ram from a different well know. Retailer for electronics on sale at a steal!But my system may have Been a rare occurrence and I would still highly recommend this product. It‚Äôs truly remarkable how heavy duty this thing feels. And it‚Äôs now been problem free over a week so I‚Äôm happy to say all has been solved thanks to me. Asus needs to check their products better before putting them in the hands of customers.

  First off the laptop does not have a built in camera. Second there are only two usb ports on the device, meaning that if you wanted to use an external camera through usb you will only be left with 1 port to use if you wanted to also use the second port for a wire-less mouse. There is also no ethernet port built in for those who wanted to get the best out of their internet. You would need to buy a docking station/usb hub to get more usb ports and an ethernet port. With that out of the way let me talk about the actual performance of the system. For some reason ever since I bought this pc occasionally when streaming videos it would crash and the ""blue screen of death"" would appear. This happened on multiple times even when I reset the pc. The system is not very responsive, every time I open adobe to create a video the software stutters and lags while other applications seem to work fine at times. All in all please look at other varieties to save yourself frustration

  I've been on the hunt for a good laptop and it was really hard to decided until I saw this monster. The power of this laptop, coupled with the fact that it's so small and portable makes it the ultimate laptop in my opinion. The purpose of getting a laptop is portability, and typically gaming laptops are gigantic and bulky making it awkward to transport.Pros:- Light, portable- Metal Frame- Great keyboard layout- Incredible monitor- Handles any game I throw at it, at maximum graphics. I've played Eve Online, Destiny, Rogue Company, Leagues of Legends, and World of Warships with 0 issues.- Great for video edittingCons:- Gets hot, which is understandable because POWER!!!- Personally I'd like 1 more USB port but that's me being needy, it does have the USB C PortsIf you're looking for a gaming laptop and portability is important to you, get this one.

  This laptop is seriously the best gaming experience, with a monitor included (obviously, it‚Äôs a laptop) that you‚Äôre going to find for $999 right now. That being said I will get into the pros and cons.Pros:Obviously the CPU. This thing is packing serious power, that being said this is a very hot CPU. I‚Äôm seeing average temps of about 86-95 degrees and it pretty much doesn‚Äôt ever go under that during gaming. This is to be expected with a gaming laptop but don‚Äôt expect it to run cooler than the intel solutions in this class.Gtx 1660ti that is on par with the 2019 Helios 300. I have ran 3d mark time spy benchmarks on both and they are within the margin of error of each other, so this is a very good performing GPU. Will be a great gamer at 1080p for the near future.Best gaming setup for $999 you‚Äôll find brand new to date.CONS:The one and only con I can really come up with is the display. It is absolutely atrocious. It does it‚Äôs job, but pretty much any other display would have looked better. Colors are obviously dull and washed out, don‚Äôt be expecting to do any photo editing or anything like that with this one.In addition the fan profiles are locked and there is no manual control over the curves. I feel they are slow to ramp up with the load on the CPU causing it to spike higher than it would if the fans stayed at a fixed speed for a while after the work load reduces, this causes a lot of fluctuation during gaming, and a overall very unpleasant noise level.

  At $999 the Asus TUF A15 is better than anything else in the market. After adding a Adata SX8200 Pro 2TB Nvme SSD and using it for a few days, here is my opinion on the laptop:The build quality is much better than previous generation TUF models.Keyboard has good depth and feel.Cooling is great although the fan noise could be better.Screen is perfectly fine at this price.The Kingston Nvme SSD is good, around 2000 MB/S read write.The Asus software is good and Windows 10 came with a little bonus of DTS sound unbound, very nice loud speakers with decent bass.I am not surprised it sold out everywhere.Edit: 3 weeks in the color on the screen became much more vibrant. I believe they are in line with some of the better laptop screen on the market.

  I did tons of research and got the $999 version with a 512ssd, 4800h, 1660ti.  There were a few reviews on Amzon and other places that bring up the screen as a weak point. The screen is not the best for color accuracy, but it is still 144hz.  Unless you sit this thing next to a high quality panel, no real human will be able to tell a difference.This laptop is literally perfect for my needs when I am around the house.  I would not travel with this thing, although I could, but I already have to lug a work laptop around.I do lots of encoding of audiofiles, no video editing, and some gaming... I'm big on RPGs, dont like FPS at all.Battery life is insane.... like 8-9 hours.  Very happy with my purchase.

  Probably the best value laptop on the market right now. I was a little hesitant at first to purchase it due to all the reviews I've seen saying that the display is terrible. While it's certainly not great, it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. The colors do look a little washed out, but unless you're using this laptop for photo editing/content creation, it's really not a big deal. I use it for work, gaming, and schoolwork, so just changing the digital vibrance fixed the color issue for me.Build quality is great, much better than other gaming laptops I've handled in the past. Feels very sturdy.Battery life is as good as advertised. I get about 8-10 hours of normal use while working from home and it easily lasts through my whole workday.Runs pretty much every game I throw at it with no issues. I mostly play games like CS:GO and VALORANT on the lowest possible settings so take that with a grain of salt. I get around 250 fps in CS and 200-250 in VALORANT. The ""poor response time"" of the display that I've seen mentioned in reviews is a non-issue for me, and I'm a (relatively) high level CS:GO/VALORANT player (SMFC in CS, Diamond in VALORANT). I really doubt most people would notice it and it doesn't affect my performance in FPS games.Update: 100+ FPS in Monster Hunter World on high settings, 100+ FPS in GTA 5 on medium, 150+ FPS in The Witcher 3 on high5/5 buy this laptop

  It's running great, except there's a firmware issue of some sort that causes all USB devices to disconnect whenever I join any kind of video call through any kind of browser. So far, I've tested Zoom, Hangouts, and Hangout Meet.

  I just got this laptop as a early Christmas gift and have been playing with it for almost 2 days now. Here are my thoughts.Build Quality: It's great! It feels well made and the materials feel nice to the touch. I suppose the screen could be a little more rigid but all and all I am impressed. 5 out of 5Display: The screen is well backlit, no obvious dark areas and the image is crisp and clear. Absolutely no complaints!Sound: I don't really use the laptop speakers much but my impression of them isn't bad. They are certainly good enough for watching netflix or listening to some music. I just prefer headphones. 5 out of 5Keyboard: I love this keyboard. It is quiet, responsive to light key presses and it is backlit with 10key. I am not really sure what more you could ask for. 5 out of 5Performance: This is a speedy laptop, surfing the web is quick and lag free. Opening programs seems to only be limited by the slow HDD. Replacing that ASAP with a SSD. Multitasking is easy and flows right into the next program without a hiccup. 5 out of 5Gaming: If you are looking for a gaming laptop this is NOT the laptop for you. If you want to play Minecraft and maybe some older games like Bioshock, Fear 3, Half-Life 2 or Civilization IV (The few games I have tried) it will get the job done. I was pretty surprised actually. 4 out of 5 (I didn't expect any gaming)Battery: The battery life is great. I get on average about 5 hours per charge (sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on what I am doing)I am very happy with this laptop. I couldn't really ask for more for the money.

  I love my new computerRefurbished qualitythe quality is fine, almost as new, when I got it it had a very small dent in the back of the screen, and the mouse was 'stuck' such that I could not left click in he left most corner, after heavy use the mouse has unstuck itself, but left clicking is still slightly worse than ideal. I don't use the mouse much so this is not an issue for me.The Good: - The screen: The image is sharp, even from a 60 degree angle!, so it is a good laptop to watch movies on.The Neutral: - The Trackpad  -- Two finger scrolling and other gestures is about as good as most other windows PC (maybe even slightly above average), but my previous computer was a 5 years old mac, which had a much better touch pad.  -- If you are a modern person tapping instead of clicking then only the gesturing is an issue, if you click you will be anoyd that 1 in 10 times it is registers as a move half and inc and then click :S. - - When typing on the keyboard (which I do a 50 hours a week) I have not had any issues with the mouse reacting to my pawns striking the mouse, this is a HUGE PLUS over many other trackpads - The Keyboard: The Keyboard build quality is better than expected, almost as good as the macbook pro keyboardsThe bad: - backplate: It is very hard to remove the back of the laptop and exchange the hardisk (I have not done this, because I don't want to loose my warranty, but I saw a youtube video explaining how and it looks like the risk of breaking the plastic is not zero) - boot time: Also the computer takes longer than expected to boot windows (and linux). Though it runs both operating systems very smooth once booted.Of course the cpu, monitor and amount of RAM is amazing for the price, so I am still a happy customer.For GNU/Linux users:There is a bug causing the screen touch screen driver to be unloaded after sleep waking from sleep:on debian 8 this command fixes it:/sbin/rmmod hid_multitouch && /sbin/modprobe hid_multitouchThere is a bug causing Gnome 3 to hang after sleep using kernels newer than 3.15: - recompiling kernel 3.14.36 solved this for meFor International BuyersMy largest complaint is that I had to pay 200$ extra in import taxes, that amazon did not include in the price... But I believe this is amazons fault and not ASUS or the people who sell the laptop trough amazon, thus I still gave it 5 stars.

  The specs are good and after adding a solid state drive the performance is great. The 4th gen core i5 is great on battery and still delivers solid performance. This laptop is replacing an Asus with a core i3 which never seemed to perform as well under load. One thing to note, you cannot run Windows 7 on this laptop. Also what is the deal with touch screen laptops that do not flip around to become a quasi tablet. It doesn't make any sense!

  The Q501 can still be a great laptop if you install an SSD on it. The 5400RPM HDD it comes with is just awful. 6GB or 8GB of RAM don't make that much of a difference depending on which apps you're using. The IPS touchscreen looks beautiful. The keyboard has a bit of a plastic feeling. This is not a gaming laptop, but a great one if you work with Office and Internet. If you want a top Asus laptop, look for the Q503 with Nvidia.

  This laptop is awesome, especially for the price. I bought an i3 HP laptop and returned it - it was way too slow. This i5 machine is MUCH faster. I am thoroughly impressed by it, and I am not impressed easily when it comes to computers. The features are very generous for the price. The machine was refurbished, but when I opened it, it was indistinguishable from a brand new machine. As someone who is very computer savvy, this laptop is highly recommended.

  let me start by saying after several months of use overall I don't like it. Would have been good if the wireless card would stay connected to my home network (AC7260), POWER STATE DRIVER FAILURE continues to plague this laptop and my patience. It must be in the configuration from ASUS.

  Well, the laptop overall is awesome!! For more details just go to the Asus page or Youtube.Now, for the hard part. I am currently living in Mexico and this model won't be available here and that is why I decided to get this laptop from a third party seller (more $) trough Amazon (+ import fees $ + shipping cost $). I know there are probably cheaper ways to get this but I decided to go with Amazon convinced they will handle all the paperwork and the import process.Unfortunately I was wrong. For my particular case, Mexican government has a set of rules called NOMs (Mexican Official Norms), and those apply for any foreign product with a cost higher than &1,000.00 USD. There are several NOMs a product has to comply with and getting the certificates is a rather long process that involves sending the product to a specialized lab for testing and a really long time waiting on the federal agencies for any response. The NOMs are in place to ensure a foreign product can be used with out harm within Mexican territory.While I was researching all these ""fun"" rules and their applications, I got to realize that they are aimed to the big importing companies. The ones that get a foreign product to be sold in Mexico, and in my case I am just a final customer looking to buy an awesome laptop.In my opinion, getting this certificates is the job of the ones like Amazon or the third party seller I got the laptop from: Michael Electronics; since they are selling and importing this product to a foreign country.I went trough a rather worrisome process where my laptop got hold on customs office for over 10 days. During this time I was in constant communication with Amazon and Michael Electronics and although they were super polite, they were NOT helpful.In order to get my laptop released I had to obtain an especial letter from Mexican government to exempt 2 (of many) NOMs. Surprisingly, Mexican federal agencies where extremely helpful and they got me the letter in 5 business days. I then submitted the letter to the customs officials and finally got my laptop.In summary:I don't believe this laptop should be sold by Amazon without the required documentation, the risk of the product getting stalled in customs offices is very high and there is no warranty that Amazon will issue a full refund (according to the representatives I spoke with). I could complain about the NOMs but foreign country laws are way out of our control and then again this is WHY we use big selling companies like Amazon. I believe Michael Electronics shares responsibility too but I also believe this is WHY they choose to sell their products trough Amazon. According to Mexican government agencies Amazon has A LOT of issues related to Mexican NOMs so to them: PLEASE, it is not a new topic and I am NOT the only one.For everyone looking to import this awesome laptop from America beware of what happened to me.Best regards!

  I won‚Äôt write a lot because it‚Äôs a great laptop with a competitive price!And for me it‚Äôs the best you can buy write now!About my expectations:1. I didn‚Äôt expected a small scratch from the back!Which seems that I could have got an open-box piece. And if that is the case, it would be a disappointment!2. The battery üîã has a long lifetime which is good of course. But if you were doing your research without trying the laptop your self, you could find that they were exaggerating a little bit3. I really didn‚Äôt expected that there are versions do not include anime matrix but that didn‚Äôt bother me anyway because I would not go for it with an increase in ( price, available date, weight, thickness and whatever small wattage amount it would take)4. Finally, webcam. The second day I received the laptop, I needed to make a video call. Guess what, I spent almost an hour to check where is the cam üòÇI mean it would not bother them to add one even in keyboard like HUAWEI matebook d14 for instance!

  You get a ryzen 9, an rtx 2060 and a 1080p 120hz display, this is one of the combinations with the best performance per dollar. Out of the box, the PC worked perfectly for me without much tweaking, only problem I had was that it came with windows 10 home rather than pro, which for my case, needed an upgrade; hope it's possible to ship pro versions in future. For the power it packs, this pc is thinner than most, definitely not MacBook pro thin but not much thicker than it, which is a definite plus; it's also a lot lighter than my MacBook with markedly better performance - that ryzen chip trades punches with the i9 in the Mac and gpu performance isn't even a question - for meI also like the fact that the pc comes with minimum bloatware, I didnt have to Uninstall anything at the very beginning, it's a clean, well designed and properly executed piece of hardware, gold stars to AsusI love this PC but I objectively have two issues with it:1. The success rate of the fingerprint scanning-caching function is abominable - 6/10 times I genuinely have to enter my pin and 9/10 times I have to rescan my finger, usually a different finger to get through windows hello. I really hope that Asus has a fix coming in soon, if it's a software related issue2. The backlight for the keyboard is uneven and if you're in a well lit room, then it's easier to see the keys with the backlight off. In my case, I use it late at night when I really need the backlight but otherwise by default it's offFor price to performance, it's a buy, right now prices are going down due to the upcoming 5000 series cpu and 30 series gpu models, if you'd want to wait for those, absolutely - from the looks of it, Asus has made a great pc even better in 2021, but nothing would beat the price for last year's model.

  Shortly after I received the laptop (and before I had fully grasped hoe to use the screen touchpad) the major Windows 10 update was installed. The touchpad stopped responding, the F6 key to toggle the touchpad on/off quit working. The Bluetooth mouse I had connected stopped working too. After several days of frustration (I was ready to return it) every time I restarted the laptop it notified that software and/or drivers were being updated. First the Bluetooth mouse began working, later the touchpad began to respond, and finally the F6 key responded correctly. It appears that the advanced features of the Vivobook were not available in the Windows 10 ""update"" and that Asus drivers had to catch up. A month later all malfuncfions seem to be corrected. It is very stylish and thin laptop. I am glad I kept it!!!!

  Love this computer so far. It is super lightweight and easy to carry anywhere while at the same time the screen is quite large and high quality. The facial scanner is very convenient and the screen pad is pretty nifty too. That is the reason I paid $50 extra for this laptop as opposed to the previous years model.

  Very satisfied with the purchase so far.  I've been eyeing the Vivobook line for quite some time and certainly glad I pulled the trigger on this.  You get a sleek machine with impressive specs that feels very high-end, at a very attractive price.  Love the Facial Recognition feature which makes for a quick login.  Haven't quite figured out how to incorporate the Screenpad 2.0 into daily use, but it's fun to have.  The only gripe I have is on the sound where seems a bit weak/stereo-like - but I guess that's standard for slim laptops these days.  Something that can be fixed with a bluetooth headset, speakers, soundbar.  I highly recommend this good value buy.

  I really wanted to keep this laptop, it's lightweight, not as fast as my other laptop, but fast enough. Fans us a bit loud, but the mini screen was so cool, extending and duplicating my screen was amazing! Unfortunately, as soon as I tried to switch duplicate screen with the switch button, the screen turned black and never worked again. Mind you, this was day one :(. Unfortunately,  I had to return it, maybe it will take a bit longer before this technology is perfect, but I can't wait till it is, I am a dev, so I am excited for when they finally release their SDK for the screenpad.

  I will start this review by saying this is my second laptop to buy in the last 2 months. My first purchase was an HP Envy that I ordered directly through HP because of discounts through my company. I received the computer and was blown away at the speed of the solid state hard drive paired with 16 gigs of ram. 9 days later, I opened the computer all the way to the stopping point (very gently) and the screen went black and never came back on. I was livid. I returned the computer vowing never to use HP again because of the product failure and horrible customer service I encountered with them.With that being said, I did much research and came across this new model of Asus multimedia laptops. I called Asus to confirm that it was in fact the computer that I was reading about and found out that it came out in March of this year. I ordered the computer and received it 4 days later with Prime shipping. No tax, and free shipping made it a bit easier to pay that much for a computer. I will give you my opinion about this new laptopPros:-Very well built machine. The frame seems very strong and looks sleek. A solid hinge on the screen seems like a better idea than the 2 smaller hinges on the HP.-You can turn the track pad on and off which helps if you use a mouse and don't want to accidentally hit the track pad while typing. I had that problem alot with the HP.-Screen resolution is beautiful-Very fast. It starts up in about 14 seconds or so. That's with the facial recognition camera starting and logging you in.-The sound with the little subwoofer plugged in is really good and really loud for a laptop, if you unplug the speaker, it sucks.-The aluminum cover looks great-The heat flows out the back of the laptop which keeps your hands from getting hot on either side of the laptop-I really like the keyboard. The keys are stiff enough and solid to where they don't seem cheap. I feel like they may last a long time.Cons:-Pretty expensive laptop but you get what you pay for-mouse pad is a little raised on the right side causing a little lip to be above the body. - Manufactures defect but not really a big deal unless you are completely OCD and need everything to line up perfectly.-The hinge for the screen is butted up against one side and there is a gap in the other. It is not centered. Once again an OCD thing. lol-Like all other windows machines, a lot of junk installed that you don't need. I just uninstalled it and had no problem doing so.-Have to have subwoofer plugged in for good sound-No finger print scanner. I enjoyed having that on the HP.-Battery is sealed in. I would like to be able to take it out to replace if needed.I am very pleased with this computer. Because of the presets on battery life protection when unplugged, it runs slower when not plugged in. But this will only affect you if you are editing photos or playing high resolution games. You can adjust those settings, but will reduce battery life in doing so. And I was also very pleased with the knowledge and politeness of Asus's customer service when I talked to them.If you are looking for a laptop with great equipment inside, that of which rivals the Macbook Pro, then this is for you. I am by no means saying this is as good or better than the Macbook Pro, but it's $1000 cheaper. That helped me decide on this computer and hopefully it will be the last one I own for a good while.

  I bought this to replace a 4-year old customized Sager gaming laptop. Not that I'm the biggest gamer, but those few games I do play it handled like a champ, until it decided to kick the bucket altogether. So when I went shopping I went to great effort to find an equivalent. The CPU and GPU on this item both benchmark slightly better than those on my old computer, and my game seems to be running just as well, so I can safely say you can game decently on this computer, and by extension it would be overpowered for most business and personal use. (I ordered the low-end 1 TB magnetic drive and 8GB RAM options.) I mainly play World of Warcraft, and do so at (nearly) full graphics with nary a hiccup. With the possible exception of one particular raid boss that turns everyone into ghostly translucent skeletons, WoW is not the most graphics intensive game out there, so gamers can adjust your expectations accordingly.A note on customization: I initially spec'ed out the slightly older model Asus X550JX-DB71 at a customization shop called Xoticpc, where I got my old Sager. They're pretty good if you can put up with their customer service nonsense and have time to burn, but being without a functioning computer I came here to find the closest equivalent with Prime shipping. In doing my research I found other customization shops that carry the DS71T and offer some neat upgrades. If you have the time/money/interest, those websites may be something to pursue. Anyway....Amazon had both the DB71 for about $100 cheaper, and this item, the Asus N550JX-DS71T. I opted for the more expensive one because, while the CPU, GPU, hard drive, and RAM are the same, the DS71T can expand RAM to 16 GB, should I find I want it. The DB71 is limited to 8. Additionally the DS71T has a backlit keyboard (which I'm finding more useful than I imagined), and a touch screen (...eh...). I was going to upgrade the hard drive (if I bought through Xotic) to a hybrid drive vs the fully magnetic drive I wound up with. There is some sluggishness in alt-tabbing from a game to a browser, but that may be a Windows 10 issue vs the lack of a hybrid drive.As for the computer itself:-The aluminum case is sleek, light, and attractive.-The hinge is too tight for the base of the computer. With it sitting on the table, if you try to open it with one hand, you'll wind up just picking up the whole computer. I hope the hinge will loosen with use.-The keys sometimes squeak.-The screen is crystal clear, but it's glossy and very prone to glare. Be aware of this if you use your computer in public areas.-There's a quick access button on the case that opens a program or website of your choice. I haven't found much use for it.-The computer ships with Windows 8.1, but I immediately upgraded to 10. It was painless and took about 1 hour of touch time (mostly me setting options and trying to wake up Cortana) and maybe 4 of it chugging away while I was out at brunch. At the time of writing, that upgrade is free and you can start it off by going to Windows' website, vs waiting for the option to pop up. I'm ambivalent on Win 10, were it not for my old computer dying suddenly I would have preferred to keep 7 until 10 got its first major service pack. There are a lot of bugs and Cortana is still phone- and web-search-oriented, unable to integrate with the sorts of things you do on a laptop like opening directories, setting control panel options, or preparing for your day. I could go on, but this isn't a Windows 10 review.-The computer ships with a fair amount of Windows bloatware. It's worthwhile going through and uninstalling everything you don't intend to use.-There is an external ""subwoofer"" that's about 4"" tall and plugs in. It really does add depth and clarity to your sound, but at anything beyond low- to mid-volume the overall experience is quite harsh. It limits portability and the plug conflicts with the power cable. If I really want good sound I can bluetooth connect to my real stereo system using a simple $30 bluetooth audio receiver. Or just a long audio cable.-All the ports are on the sides. In particular the USB ports are annoying, as I use a wireless mouse with a small receiver plugged in. I'd prefer to have it out of the way and out of mind on the back.-There are a number of useful function keys my old computer didn't have, though depending on what you're used to these may be old hat: You can toggle the track pad on and off, put it to sleep, access power options and display settings, call up a calculator, and use play/pause/rewind/ff functions.Overall, this is a good purchase fitting the needs of a computer user with moderate computational needs, with some excess capability, for moderate cost.

  The cursor jumps all over the place.  You never know where it is going to be next.  Slows down all my work looking down to see where the cursor is so that I can move it back - doesn't mean it's going to stay there though.  Other than that, it works fine.

  After a week of shopping and one purchase/immediate return of an Acer Swift 5, this Vivobook met all my expectations. This is exactly what I was looking for. Compared to my last laptop (Acer Aspire E15) this is a much thinner and smaller laptop. It has a 15.6"" screen placed onto a 14"" body. The screen is vibrant and colorful. Not an anti-glare screen so you'll need to find shade if you want to work outside. The thin bezels of the screen add to the sleek design of the laptop. The keyboard feels solid and has good travel. Screenpad 2.0 is very useful for multitasking but there is a bit of a learning curve. With the i7 10th gen, 16 gb ram, the NVidia mx250, and 1 gb SSD, speed is no problem. Also, this thing runs fairly cool. Does warm up a bit during extensive work. When the fans run, they run quiet. For those curious, this can be opened with one hand. Have not played any games on this yet but plan to down the road. Other reviews have stated that this can handle games such as PUBG on low settings running about 30 fps.There are four minor downsides. First, the numpad is a bit cramped on the right side but that is no big deal. Second, there is no optical drive and only a micro SD card reader. I combined these two because I have PowerDirector on disc and none of my cameras have micro SD. You will need to buy an external SD reader and external CD/DVD drive to handle classic multimedia needs. Third, the webcam could be better but gets the job done. Already have done a zoom meeting and the quality wasn't too bad. The facial recognition makes up for this. Next, the two USB slots on the left side of the computer are 2.0 instead of 3.0 which is a bit of a letdown.Ultimately, if you're looking for a great laptop with great specs without having to shell out an extra $500 for a Dell XPS 13/14 or Macbook Pro, this is the one for you.

  Bought this laptop for the price and the cool features( facial recognition,screen pad 2.0,large SSD,condensed size etc),and all these features are indeed excellent. The build quality feels premium and the back lit keyboard feels pretty nice. After reading several reviews and spending a few days working with it,I decided to upgrade the memory,as in my case and many other people's cases,with multiple tasks going on with a windows 10 laptop,you can never have enough memory. I found and ordered a stick of 32 gb samsung 2166 mhz memory and replaced the 8gb stick of hynix which was in Slot 1. This laptop came with 16 gb of memory,as 8 gb is soldered on the main board. Adding 32 gb of memory to the existing 8 gb made an already fast machine REALLY fast. Support people at Asus will tell you that you cannot upgrade the single memory slot and this just isn't true. The Intel 660p 1 Tb ssd is pretty fast,but I will ultimately(soon) replace this drive with a Samsung 760 Evo to increase the write and read times on large batch files and move the existing Intel 660p to the extra M.2 slot near the Cpu and fan on the mainboard. The Screen pad 2.0 used as a traditional track pad is excellent. Good response and very nice feel as it is covered in Gorilla glass,just like a smart phone screen. Have found that the Screen pad 2.0 apps which come with the computer are really just gimmicks. I can see where some people could find uses for them, but they have been pretty much just a novelty in my experiences. The very best part about Screen pad 2.0 is the actual screen as mentioned above. The addition of Wifi 6 ax is definitely a nice addition,as it is really fast as advertised. Also a nice feature is the Windows Hello login with the facial recognition and IR camera,which allows the camera to see you in the dark,which is VERY cool.I have also found that the speakers on this laptop sound really nice if you use the built in Audio Wizard app from Asus. The speakers are THX certified and made by Harmon Kardon,which is the manufacturer of JBL and Infinity,and other top audio products. Speakers are located on the bottom near the front corners,and if you know what you are doing and set the EQ on The Audio Wizard app,then Music and Video sounds great. Where this laptop falls short in my estimation,are the poor colors and brightness of the Full HD display. Have seen other professional reviews regarding the fairly poor quality of the display,and I have found that I am in total agreement. This laptop is so well built,with such nice features,that if it had a nice display,it would definitely be in Dell XPS, Asus Zenbook territory. Unfortunately you pay the piper for the reasonable list price with a fairly cheap display that does the job,but has no richness when you view HDR content or content filmed in really nice quality. It works and is Full HD,but just doesn't measure up to the rest of the build. I also would've liked my type C 3.1 USB port to allow me to charge the laptop. Also,its a small issue in my case,but many others have complained about Asus cheaping out by only adding 1 full sized 3.1 USB port ,and making the 2 ports on the left side USB 2.0 instead of 3.1 ports. I usually don't use a lot of USB gadgets,so I don't really have a problem with this. I have found that the performance of the I7 1051ou cpu has been pretty decent for the work I do on it and the entertainment sites I visit for videos while working on the road. Another letdown for me is the actual screen on battery time....this unit has a fairly small battery and the comet lake I7 is a low wattage CPU,but actual usage time on battery is small. Your mileage may vary due to amount of processes you have open and screen brightness etc, but don't expect to lug this unit around to multiple classes,meetings etc. without having a nearby AC outlet to plug into....All in all,this is a really cool little laptop with some really nice features and build quality,that could've been pretty awesome,but It's obviously the price that kept Asus from adding the features that would've made this laptop a top tier contender.....for that,you'll need to shell out another $ 500 to $1000 to get the Asus Zenbook,Dell XPS or other top tier offerings. For my money, I am perfectly happy with my purchase,but will do a little more extensive research next time to be sure and get a nicer display.

  A lightweight laptop that packs a big punch. At first I didn't really like this laptop. I honestly don't use the touchpad and disabled it. I had an issue a couple of times with my screen being black and my windows being on the touchpad. I almost returned the laptop but I couldn't afford to be without one as I do a lot of graphic design. Other than the senseless touchpad, the laptop works really well. It handles high performance software programs without overheating. I have it on a laptop stand that has a fan. I don't have to turn the fan on that often. The laptop has a great speed. The battery life is okay. I unplug it at night, let it sleep, and by the morning it's usually almost dead. If I unplug and continuously use, it will last about 2.5hrs before I have to plug it back in. Not an issue for me. The screen is clear. I do have an issue with it sometimes going slightly darker and then brighter again while I'm using it. I don't know why it does this. It's not continual and only happens once in a while. I would recommend this laptop. The price is good for what you get. If you have another $400 to spend I would go with a slightly better laptop. I had to come within a certain budget with certain specs. All in all I am very happy with this laptop. I'm usually on it working for 14hrs every day so it can handle a lot! I've had it for 3 months now so apart from those minor annoyances I would say that I am happy with my purchase.

  I ordered this for my doctoral research purpose. This laptop has a good processor and a considerable memory. The drawback of this laptop is that once I had left it in sleep mode keeping the charger on and  It heated so badly that it almost stopped working. If you are using this laptop for running long scripts in python, matlab or R, you may need to wait a bit more to get the result. For rest of the purpose, this laptop works good.

  I was hoping that this ASUS laptop would be a pleasant upgrade to a 6 year old ASUS ROG laptop. Unfortunately, right out of the box this laptop immediately started overheating on startup. When I opened up an internet browser, or tried using the file explorer, this laptop froze several times. Seems like plain bad luck, but this is really disappointing since I've had an ASUS for several years, and it never had problems like this.

  The build is excellent, it looks and feels great. The screen is easily the best laptop screen I‚Äôve ever used and the color accuracy is great (I didn‚Äôt even need to use my screen calibrator, it is that good). The design is sleek, feels high quality and generally a pleasure to use. Performance is excellent with a caveat - the laptop is very hot. There are two fan vents on the bottom plate and the are BLOCKED OFF with two thin pieces of plastic. Asus apparently has said this is to divert heat from the keyboard however this severely restricts airflow inside the case and causes such high temperatures that the keyboard still gets how and causes fan use even when idling and heavy fan use as well as 90+ degree temps while gaming or doing anything intensive. There is a fix but it will void your warranty and that is to simply remove the bottom plate and take off the thin flimsy vent blocks. This alone drastically improves performance since with the vent blocks the system will throttle due to the high temperatures. There is another thing that will help but it takes going into the registry to change the behavior of the cpu boost and enable Efficient Aggressive boost mode. Info on that can be found on Reddit if you don‚Äôt know how to do it.So with that said, after those changes it is an excellent laptop with great performance considering how light and thin it is. I am very happy with it now but how many stars should be removed for such an idiotic decision to block the fan vents, and to not actually have the option for a still powerful but more efficient boost mode? It‚Äôs a deal breaker imo considering the high temps with the fan vents blocks in place but I like the laptop so much otherwise that I just took off one star for the questionable design decision since it is a simple remedy. If I wasn‚Äôt on the tech savvy side, wasn‚Äôt comfortable going inside the case (and knowing how to edit the registry, though just removing the vent blocks is enough to lower temps drastically) I would likely not be happy with this laptop because it ran so hot that more than a couple seconds touching it would have burned me. After the changes though it runs 10-20 degrees lower at all times and doesn‚Äôt throttle at all...a shame they couldn‚Äôt ship the laptop in this state because it is so good but I know a large amount of users will never find this info or will not be comfortable making these changes themselves. My only other complaint is no fn lock so all of the fn keys are more inconvenient to access...seems like an oversight there.If you are willing to take the time to address the above issues yourself then this is an easy decision to buy. If not then think carefully about the temperature issues because you will have them if leaving the laptop stock.

  Extremely  impressed with the quality of this laptop.  Very solid but yet lightweight and thin profile.  Performance has been excellent so far with quiet and powerful graphics .  My first AMD based laptop and very impressed with the Ryzen 9 4000 speed and low power consumption, prolonging battery performance.  Just an FYI, this model has 8GB soldered on the motherboard at 3200MHZ and Samsung SODIMM DDR4 8GB RAM 3200MHZ in the single ram expansion slot.  If you want more than 16GB total ram,  you have to replace the 8GB ram with a larger one purchased separately,  The keyboard and lighting (only white background color) is excellent and heavy duty.  You can feel the quality.  The screen refresh speed and colors are amazing.  Highly recommended for upper medium gaming performance use and everyday fun.

  The only thing I was surprised about is the memory configuration. It has 8gb soldered to the MB and a 8gb memory card in the socket.  I added a 16gb card and now have 24gb total.  I checked with Asus, and verified it will take a 32gb card for a total of 40gb Ram.  Everything thing else is exactly as expected, and the specs are far better than any other $1300 laptop available at the time of purchase.  Note: 2021 models have 16gb soldered to the MB and the memory slot is open.

  Asus really did it this time with this brand new ASUS ZENBOOK 15 4K edition comes with dedicated graphics GTX 1650 Nvidia.15.6 inch UHD + 178 WideView Nano edge display (4096X2160) So picture quality is really good and colors are vibrant. I believe screen NITS brightness is 330 to 350 but honestly description doesn't say and no reviews out yet for this high end model of the Zenbook 15.Performance is outstanding it's a multitasking power house honestly. The 10th gen I7-1051OU handles tasks like it's nothing. I could be watching youtube than at the same time pull up an excel spreadsheet file and power point all on one screen than jump into adobe pro and render a photo or video. It is literally night and day compared to my old Coffee lake MSI. These 10th gens run relatively cool so this laptop under heavy load can get hot like 92 degrees HOT ! However at 3.2 ghtz the CPU backs down on these Comet lakes to a cooler temp around 2.6 to 2.8 ghtz. It really is something you need to see for yourself.Hows gaming? actually very good utilizing the GTX 1650 Nvidia Graphics card for lighter titles you can edasily get away with 38 to 65 FPS on high settings FHD. In Children of Morta I was playing full 4K 60 FPS. Trials of Mana 4K was around 38 to 42 FPS FULL UHD of course you will need to be plugged into ASUS 120 watt power adapter don't expect to see these results on battery lol.Now lets discuss screen pad 2.0 ya know the mouse pad with 5.8 inch touch screen?Ok this is a hit or miss here you either really like it or you don't. For me personally I don't use it I believe after some software tweaks and updates from ASUS the pad may be more useable but as for now No I really dont see the need for it.I watched netflix on it the other day while working on my excel SS for work so that was kind of cool I guess. But besides the calculator I don't really see a definitive use for it. Its basically like a show your friends type technology.The top 5 best PARTS about this new 10th Gen ASUS ZENBOOK 4K edition has to be well#1 The 4K IPS screen.#2 The Comet lake 10th Gen I7-1051OU 4 core 8 thread processor#3 The Nvidia GTX 1650 discreet graphics card.#4 the keyboard very easy to type on I happen to like and use everyday the number pad I for one am glad it's there. The back lighting is just ok to me not very bright and some keys I notice do not light up at all. High brightness on the keyboard is just weird to me. I think ASUS should have taken a different approach to this keyboard lighting entirely but hey it gets the job done.#5 How thin and light the LAPTOP is to carry around really this thing is light like 4.2 pounds for a 15 inch laptop wow that is amazing.So in conclusion do I recommend this laptop?yes absolutely I do however I would save your money and if you want 4K it will cost you round $200 more for the blue and gold edition just get the silver icy lake like I did and instead of $1399 you pay $1199 ha ha your choice but I think the Icy lake silver IMO is the way to go and plus will save you some money.Bottom Line: If you want a fast performing multitasking laptop with some light to medium gaming on the side than this is the laptop for you.On a side note before making this purchase for the Zenbook 15 I did look and research the ASUS G14 laptop with the AMD 4900HS in it and the HEAT?? is what helped me make my decision to buy this one. The thermals were way to high for my comfort. Hope this review helps in your purchase decision for this Ultrabook high performance Laptop.

  I purchased the brand new Asus Zenbook 15 after a week of research and reading customer reviews.  The majority of complaints I read had to do with the touch pad.  Its a pretty novel feature that I turned off because I didn't see it's usefulness.After using the Zenbook at home for the first week, I was completely impressed with its performance.  Unfortunately, the left hinge holding the screen broke coming detached from the screen when I opened it.  I've seen this in other laptops.  Usually due to manufacturers making the hinges too stiff or designers just trying to save weight.  Regardless of my opinion, I reached out to ASUS to get an RMA number and they informed me that they would repair the hinge but since I didn't purchase the ""extended warranty"", I would have to pay for the repairs.  Even though the defective hinge that broke my display happened by OPENING THE SCREEN, Asus would only repair it if I payed them!  Needless to say, I didn't send them my laptop to get repaired.  The pics I share are after a couple months of using a laptop with a broken hinge being held together with Gorilla tape.  Broken hinge led to cracking of the display/hinge on the right.  I just can't bring myself to pay a manufacturer for repairing a basic function.  If a door broke on a brand new car just by opening it, how many people would be willing to pay for that repair.It pains me to share this review because I only buy Asus and the laptop is no longer usable.  My last 5 computer builds contained mostly Asus components (motherboards, power supplies, video cards, drives).  Since Asus feels that an extended warranty purchsase is necessary to cover such abusive acts as opening the lid of their laptop, I'm not such a fan of Asus anymore.

  This laptop is exactly what I expected it to be. However, as two other reviews have mentioned, there is an issue with internet connectivity.My device will randomly disconnect from the internet sometime during its usage about 4/5 times that I power it on. It struggles to reconnect to the network. I then have to manually reconnect it and almost always, within the hour, it will disconnect again.My laptop is 14 days old at this point in time, with this issue appearing on day 2. I have used it primarily for gaming thus far, so It has definitely been a nuisance.I plan on returning this, and getting the same laptop as a replacement. Hopefully it is just an unlikely bug.Update (7/14/2020):It has been a little over a week and one month now that I have had this laptop. I did not end up sending it back. After more in-depth troubleshooting, the solution ended up being a network reset. I had to go to my settings and select ""Network Reset"". Windows automatically uninstalled and reinstalled my network-related drivers, and I have had no issues for the last 4 weeks.For anyone else who happens to have this issue, that is my suggestion. Great laptop. It's unfortunate that network bug is there, but I am very happy with this overall! It is great for a productivity/entertainment laptop!Update (12/7/2020):The conneciton issue has returned and been very bad the last few days, a network reset didn't do anything.

  go ahead and get this laptop for VR if you want to have a headache, driver's that don't work, a conversion cord from thunderbolt to Displayport which drastically effects VR quality. This laptop im sure is fine for gaming, but to advertise it as VR ready is a complete lie. Could not use with my Valve Index.

  I love the laptop, It's beautiful but many features were half baked. Asus is terrible at providing up to date drivers so if you have an issue, microsoft will fix it before Asus will ever get a chance to.Since Asus uses customized hardware, you aren't able to use the intel drivers, and depend on asus to fix driver issues.Big  rabbit hole!Most of the cool features of this laptop only work on Windows. Along with mousepad tracking issues, you will notice random interrupts, even when using Windows.Update 07/20/2019:After dealing with ASUS, I regret this purchase.ASUS customer service was unhelpful at best, clearly didn't take the time to address the concerns on my email.They also said that many of the features and drivers (such as Alexa voice functionally, or even their software update utility ""My Asus"") do not work with a fresh Windows 10 installation (a image without ASUS modifications), then offered to provide (FOR PURCHASE) a recovery medium in case I needed to re-image the computer.

  So, I will preface this with saying, I have built computers and have been using Windows since XP. While I'm no computer expert, I have a fair share of knowledge and know my way around the device.That being said, while this is a beautiful computer and the functionality and design is as promised: sleek, cool, etc., given the issues I've had technically with my device, these extraneous details come across now as merely gimmicky. I purchased the laptop, swapping it out for my gaming laptop, as I now travel for work and needed something lighter and with much better battery life. However, even turning all of the settings down and close all other applications, the longest I've gotten the battery to last while using just Word is just under 4 hours, only an hour longer than my old gaming laptop. Dissapointing certainly, but not a deal-breaker.About two weeks after purchase, I arrived at work and began using the laptop for extended hours which is where many of my issues began to arise. At no point would I have more than 9 applications running, or 5 windows open (active applications). And yet, after perhaps 2-3 hours, performance would drop drasticaly. CPU usage never exceed 55% and yet the processing speed of the device would make it unusable. The applications I use for my work; Microsoft Office, Edge, Creative Commons; none have particularly heavy drains on the CPU or memory (save the browser of course, but if it can't run a browser then..). Throughout a work day, I may have to power down my computer twice and let it sit for a few minutes to cool down. This comes as odd given the fan which actually keeps the computer relatively cool. This was mildly irritating but I was stubborn so I looked for solutions.Then, recently about 4 days ago, the CPU seemed to give out entirely. To avoid having to reset my entire pc while abroad, I've had to all but suspend all start-up applications and boot-up and then close all necessary applications. Due to my modifications, the machine runs about similarly to how I described above. However, the start-up process I have to go through (especially when I went out of my way to purchase a computer with a SSD) is just annoying lol. What irks me is that this deterioration comes ""conveniently"" 3 days after my return policy expires. Not really making any accusations here, but sheesh, frustrating.All of this being said. If you're looking for a cool looking computer and all you do is write, and watch videos for short bursts of time, I guess I can recommend this computer. However, as they advertise it as a 'light' work computer, I must put the emphasis on the 'light' part. It cannot really handle any tasks that need much computing power and can't handle any tasks for extended periods of time. For that reason, as I swamp through the process of warranty redemption, I can't personally recommend this particular machine.(I acknowledge though that my device may be an exception though).

  My model is the cobalt blue, i7-8565U with 16GB of RAM and UHD 4K Touch monitor.  I've been using this laptop as my daily driver (web development, some graphics work) and it absolutely rocks and is well worth the price.The SSD I received in mine was a Samsung 981 NVMe, and is blazing fast.The two thunderbolt connections are full 4-lane PCIe.Highly recommended, unless you need any gaming functionality - the graphics are integrated with the CPU (Intel UHD 620) and while it is capable of running older games, anything new will require running an eGPU, which I haven't tested.Build quality is great. The keyboard has a good amount of play to it, and combined with the slight angle to the laptop base while open it makes for a pleasant typing experience.Battery life is around average, but it's about what can be expected for such a slim (and it is SLIM!) laptop like this one.I haven't had any issues with the trackpad which has been reported by some users, but it's likely due to more recent drivers fixing the issue.UHD 4K monitor is beautiful and bright, with good contrast. It has touch but I don't use it, so I can't comment on that.The model I chose came with a small dock that includes a basic USB port, a USB-C 3.1, and an HDMI port. Enough to add a couple of peripherals, but you'll likely want to go with a larger dock if you have more things to connect.Overall I am 100% happy with my purchase.No bloatware other than a couple of Asus utilities, but those can be ignored and probably removed if not needed.

  I got tired of my slow xps13 and I'm glad I found this Asus. It wakes up from sleep instantaneously(the other one was slow, wheel spinning for a few seconds ugh). It's a stunning looking laptop too. very light but sturdy. Build quality is exceptional. The screen is technically not super bright compared to others in the category but in this case I only use brightness level at about 50% because the display is very very clear and accurate. So far it runs cool. I didn't experience hot bottom with light/normal use(web, youtube, playing music, a few chrome tabs). Under heavy load it does get hot but that's expected for such a thin laptop made of aluminum. But one thing it does though, the temperature goes back to normal very fast after it finishes the heavy task.

  Well, got my brand new laptop on the 16th. Actually received it earlier than expected, kudos to Amazon for that. Unboxing experience is pretty satisfying, the computer is very well packed and it even lifts up when you take ot out of the box it comes in. Came with the stylus, a charger and two dongles.Fist of all, buid quality is premium, you can see and feel that it is well made and sturdy, hinges work as advertised and you indeed can open the lid with just one hand.After turning it on and configuring it, all went well, did the normal updates that all laptops require out of the box, installed chrome and went on my way to start backing up my data and rearanging folders.Here comes the first issue I found. I have a Logitech MX Ergo, pretty nice trackball mouse that I have enjoyed for the last six months or so and worked flawlessly with my previous Acer laptop, I went and installed it on the Asus and things started to happen. Bluetooth conectivity is bad. The mouse disconnects after just a few seconds being still. I mean 3 to 5 seconds, this is so annoying, everytime you move the mouse it lags. It drives me crazy.I have at least three days trying to fix this and nothing. Updated the BIOS to version 303, reinstalled all drivers, power management options are very limited in this version of Windows, so nothing seems to fix it. The MyAsus app is pretty mu h useless, all disgnostics say no issues found. My best guess is that bluetooth tries somehow to save power and goes to sleep, but there is no way to override this.I did tried the mouse in two other computers and it works fine. So I am sure its this laptop. My bluetooth headphones don't work very well either if they are paired both to the computer and phone, because lf this I decided to use the dongle for the headphones and discovered that it has a hissing noise, when connected through the usb c port, both ports. This does not happen when connected trhough the same dongle to my Pixel 4, so laptop again.Lets talk battery life, 10 hours, its a lie. I can understand they tend to  overrate this times, but in my case if I get 5 hours I am lucky, and this is only using Lightroom and a Sandisk Extreme SSD drive connected through usb c. Not sure if this battery is faulty, to be honest.Laptop gets a bit hot, but nothing too serious in my opinion, its understandable being so thin and small.Overall, these are the things that have bothered me about this laptop so far.Now for the good. THE SCREEN! is amazing. Even as little as it is, quality is superb, colors are very true, is super bright and sharp. I love the 4K resolution, it allows to use very small icons so you have a lot of space when working, I love this. I am currently using it with 175% zoom, and its great. Tried going smaller but it was too small. Sound on this is very good also, surprisingly good.Another thing that I liked a lot is the trackpad and the numeric keyboard function, very usefull once you set your brain to use it. Haven't used the stylus as much, I don't care about it too much. I wanted a 2 in 1 because I travel a lot and its light and can be used as a tablet for entertainment and browsing, which is great when you are on an airport. And the power allows me to handle data and peocessing for work without having to own another bigger more powerful comouter.And last but not least, this laptop is fast, paired withmy SSD file transfer are in the order of 700MB/s which is great, coming from an HHD averaging 20 to 50 MB/s, so very useful when working with phlto and vkdeo editing.This review might be a bit longer. I will try and update about the bluetooth issues and usage all together.UPDATE:So, I was watching a video last nigjt and saw this thin greenish line at the bottom of the screen, at first I thought it was from the video itself but no, is the screen. It has a fault. I did not see it at first but when I lowered the screen brightness it was very noticeable. I thought that it appeared later on, but I did took a picture lf the laptop when new out of the box and the stripre is there. So it came like this from the factory.I will have to send it for a repair. I am very upset because of this. This is a brand new very premium laptop.

  I am a computer user for over 20 years, using both Mac and Windows, my current laptop is a Surface pro 4 I bought 4 years ago and a 10 year old Imac, that still works. I needed a more powerful machine to use Zbrush 3D, this one was reccomended to me by Intel for that purpose. I liked the looks, that it has a touchscreen with pencil, good memory,  Plenty of space etc.It arrived on Tuesday and since the moment I turned on, the screen was ‚Äúwashed‚Äù on one side ( see attached photo) ,And it was superhot. I knew that it may get fixed with an update, so I did the whole windows update and Bios update from Asus site, that resolved those problems.Then, it could not connect to the internet, or connects sometimes and disconects etc...annoying. I tried to play the tech support myself and got to the point that it connects but when I put it to sleep, it will not connect automatically even if ‚Äúconnect automatically‚Äù is on, I was willing to live with that, but then the laptop started to shut off by itself several times, I had already installed zbrush and gotten some of my personal info in it, the only solution was to ‚Äú re-install windows‚Äù , I did just that, it worked for 2 days until it got some updates today and now I got the ‚Äúblue screen of death‚Äù (photo attached), it re-started 3 times and told me to use the asus diagnostic tool which I did and it came out as ‚Äúwarning: cannot detect HDD‚Äù !!!  Wow... (photo attached).I end this 5 day ordeal by sending the laptop back to Amazon for a refund, it is a shame because I had a 22 ‚Äú art tablet coming today that I was planning on using with this computer for my 3D Zbrush sculpting.I am not sure if Asus or Microsoft are to blame for this bad product, but I will have to buy a new Imac ( Will change my zbrush license to move it to Mac).I will stay away from Microsoft products for now (Surface is not perfect, but I learned to live to its issues, like screen freezes etc). and unfortunately will have to pay more for a Mac, but peace of mind and getting work done is priceless. Thank you for reading and best wishes for 2021.

  This machine is alright except for the CPU idle noise. It creates obvious buzzing noise whenever the CPU change its' clock speed, which happens all the time. I actually found a temporary fix, that I could set the CPU clock to a certain speed. However, this method drains the battery. I really regret that I got this laptop, and I'd like to get a refund if it is possible, and there is no damage in the unit at all. I am a Computer Science major student, and I have to use my laptop outside the whole day, but the battery doesn't last more than 3 hours with the 60% CPU clock with normal use. If you are old enough and your ears don't function you might be satisfied with this machine, but if you are a student, you will definitely be annoyed and disappointed by the noise.

  So far I am loving my new laptop. Laptop came brand new and with no smudges. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of one thing. The only thing I don't like is the static noise. Normally, new laptops shouldn't make a static noise. It is a small nuisance and has me weary. I could have gone with any other laptop at a much cheaper price. Instead I decided to pay extra for a high quality brand. The static does irritate and frustrate me since this is a higher brand with higher cost, which means higher expexctations out of everything. I am using this for college and do not need any other extra noise or distractions. Even if I wasn't using this for college, the static is still unexceptable. Other than the static it seems to be working fine. If anyone knows how to resolve the static noise, please tell me. Thanks.

  Bought this for my boss, he requested the maroon color & is very pleased with it. 2 days after buying it he dropped it & cracked the screen, I called Amazon to find out how I could get it repaired & I expected to to pay for the repair but was very happy to find out that ASUS gives a one time uh oh repair , great! It did take about a month to complete the repair but it was free, Amazon even paid for the shipping. I love shopping at Amazon !

  My fianc√© wanted this because it was ‚Äúa cute little red(sort of) laptop‚Äù!  Lol.  I‚Äôll give her that but not for any serious laptop users.  She could have had a $500 unit easily for what she does.  And just a 256GB drive??  She will regret that one day.  Otherwise, for what it is, it‚Äôs very nice, small and thin.  After I bought it at 1,053 a week later it dropped in price to $899.  I spoke to 4 different levels of management before I got the difference refunded.  (Don‚Äôt deal with overseas support, call during US hours).  Anyway, your paying for decent specs, small size and attractiveness.  It‚Äôs worth the price if this is what your looking for and you don‚Äôt do more than business stuff with it.

  This is a great light weight laptop with a head-turner design and color. The keyboard and touch-pad are nice and the design of the tilted keyboard is pretty useful. I do pretty much only coding on PhD level in engineering with this laptop and it has been pretty good so far (almost two months now). battery life is good and i also like the sleeve and the USB C converters that came with the laptop.

  UPDATE MARCH 2021:Well, the laptop officially crashed. Really disappointed in this company. I always heard great things and this laptop stopped functioning. No, I did not damage it. Applications would randomly stop and crash, the computer itself would glitch and black out. I did nothing but use this laptop for school work. Trackpad stopped responding and fingerprint scanner would no longer read. Recycled it.UPDATE JANUARY 2020:My laptop has quite a bit of issues. My startup doesn't always allow me to log in and my keyboard doesn't respond when I want to brighten my screen or turn the back lit keyboard on. It's rather annoying. It won't work until I restart my computer or shut it off entirely. This laptop has grown into more issues. I can't sign in half the time, it glitches, my brightness doesn't work anymore (even with following Microsoft's advice of the device manager). I don't understand when I don't do anything. I don't eat or drink on my laptop, I have never dropped it or any other damage implicated. Disappointed in this progress of ownership.ORIGINAL:I sold all my Apple products and switched over to WINDOWS. I choose this laptop because friend recommended ASUS for easy simple use. It really is easy for someone who grew up on Apple. I love how lightweight it is and the purpose it has. I only bought this for nursing school, being able to research and write papers and study on Khan Academy. So far, the battery life is horrible, lasted longer on the MAC I had. I have been using the internet all day to study and it's almost dead. I understand it dying for heavy use with multiple applications open ... but not just for the internet.

  Very nice laptop. Light, very good quality build, runs long on one charge, no complains.Contrary to other reviewers, I don't see this laptop running hot, at least not during browsing, emailing,and this kind of light activities.The only complain I might have -  the layout of the keyboard - especially power button, is awkward.PgDn,PgUp buttons are up in the 'function' keys row. Power button is in the upper-right corner - easily to me mistaken for 'backspace'.Also some of the keys (2 or 3 of them), when pressed, do not feel right. No click, and certain friction present.So far I was unable to find out how to downgrade this laptop to Win7.Win10 is just awful, but that's not the laptop fault. I wish Asus can release drivers for Win7...

  I am coming from the DELL XPS 13 9370 that unfortunately, the screen broke. To start with, the bezels on the dell is smaller at three of the edges, save the bottom. The XPS would last all day on a charge, at least for me, doing what I would consider regular stuff. This barely makes six hours in comparison. The fan would remain on most of the time while doing light stuff, web browsing, Kindle, watching Netflix etc. The Dell XPS would hardly ever switch on doing the same stuff. I've used the MyAsus application and set the fan to silent. It does not help, as far as I can see. Downloaded the latest bios update and flashed, still works the same way.The keypad is good, no problems there. The touchpad with the fingerprint scanner there in the corner is just an annoyance period, can't tell you how many times my finger slipped down there. It also feels kind of loose, noisy like. If I keep my finger and hold the pad on one corner, no problems, its silent.The screen is good and has good contrast. Looks better than the XPS screen by a small but noticeable margin. The build quality is good but I think DELL does a better job. The quality and volume of the speakers falls way short of the XPS and it rattles if you adjust the spectrum to higher levels to compensate. It stays generally cool but would rather the fan not be on all the time. While writing this review and without anything running in the background, the fan never turned off. This would definitely reduce the serviceable lifespan and I'm sure, reduce run time. I tend to take care of my stuff and have them for a long time hence why I usually invest in the premium stuff. I cannot recommend this and for the price, I would invest on a Dell XPS, beautifully made and just works without major problems out of the box.

  This thing looks a lot smaller than you'd think, until you open it up and see that big beautiful screen with almost zero bezel. It's well built, and I get compliments on it all the time. The only thing you can upgrade is the SSD, just remember to get an SSD that's single sided like a Samsung 970 (double sided ones don't fit). The processor is fast, uses little power, and does everything I need it to do. The Nvidia graphics are great if you're playing light esports titles or need it for creative work (think Adobe), but not for the heavy stuff. But that's not the point of this laptop, it's all about portability, quality, and versatility. I prefer it's construction and screen to the Dell XPS 13, not much else really compares to it. Overall it's a great laptop, but not without it's quirks...The only thing that is slightly annoying with Asus, and I've noticed this with their laptops in general, is the touchpad is a little small and can feel a little lose, making a light click when you touch it before you press down. It's not like that on all their machines, but QA lets some slip through the cracks. Eventually you get used to it and it doesn't matter, but if you're OCD, that one detail might drive you nuts. Also, the battery is pretty small at 50wh and the screen, though beautiful, doesn't get very dim at night. It would also be nice if it were a touchscreen, but beggars can't be choosers.Overall, it's a really solid machine and I highly recommend it for road warriors who want an ultrabook that can do light gaming, graphic design, or meetings, and look beautiful doing it.

  The screen and the build quality is excellent except the trackpad. It is loose and rattles when touching. i could not be sure it is a problem but after a few research i saw that this is seen on cheap laptops. but this is worth 1500+ and this is a premium class. Not worth the price

  So this is kind of an ""initial impressions"" review (I'll try to come back in a few months and update the review based on a longer experience).Things I really like:  the amazing light weight; the beautiful, bright, screen; long battery life; fast boot time via the SSD; built-in USB port; i7 core processor is fast; discrete NVIDIA video chip (bottom of the line, but still rare in a laptop this thin and light) and dedicated video memory; the supplied carrying case; fast charge time; and most of all, the sturdy, rugged chassis.The key features to me are the extremely light weight and the very high quality, CNC-machined, uni-body aluminum chassis.Things that are OK:  sound quality and volume; nonvolatile storage capacity; trackpad; keyboard; reasonably small amount of bloatware; dongle for HDMI and other connectionsThings I don't like:  power charger (cable should be longer); no Thunderbolt support; no ability to upgrade RAMThings I wish it had but understand why it doesn't . . . numeric keypad; dedicated Home and End keys; larger palm rest in front of keyboard.I have a bunch of laptops from very basic no-frills models, to heavy-duty gaming laptops with high end NVIDIA chips and lots of video memory.  I bought this laptop so I could work while traveling without lugging around any more weight than necessary.  ""Work"" for me means connecting to my office network, running basic MS Office apps (Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint) and doing Internet searches.  No video production or processing.  No heavy gaming.  Not sure whether this laptop would really be suited to such heavy-duty use.So far, this laptop really fills the bill for what I need.Overall, I love this laptop. I think we're going to be together for a long, long, time.8/26/20 UPDATE:  I said that I would try to come back in a few months and update this review based on a longer experience.  It has been several months now, and I still love this computer!  My other laptops all have 16 GB of memory and I was not sure that the 8 GB in this machine would be adequate.  So far, I have not noticed any issues with that.  Again, I mostly use this laptop for MS Office Apps, email and Internet.  Not real heavy duty.  On the other hand, the build quality of this very lightweight laptop IS heavy duty.  Solid as a bank vault.  The screen is small, but oh so bright.  This has quickly become my favorite laptop.  Highly recommended!

  TL;DR - This laptop is great for its price, and you aren't gonna find much better. The screen is OK, the battery life is OK, and the thermals/fan noise is OK, however everything else is very solid and the i7-7700hq and 1060 (Even though it has 3gb of vram) are more than enough for running games at 1080p 60fps and should still be able to hold out for 3-4 years. I definitely recommend it.The Asus FX502VM-AS73 (wow thats a mouthful) was, when i first looked at it, a great deal for some great hardware. Thankfully, I just recieved mine yesterday and everything was in a good working condition and there was no damage to the packaging or the laptop itself. I did buy from amazon warehouse, but it was listed as Used-Like New and in its original, pristine packaging. Luckily that was true, and I found no dead pixels on the screen, no mousepad issues, or any other problems. It's as if it just came off the shelf and they accidentally opened it or something. However, not everything is perfect with this laptop, so i'll start with the negatives first and work my way to the positivesCONS: - The screen is OK. I read a lot of reviews on amazon and saw that people said  the screen was horrible, that it had horrible viewing angles and colors, and was very laggy in general. However, I find none of these claims to really be 100% true. Yes, the screen is not the highest of quality, and is nothing like their GL502VM laptop, but it definitely is still good. The contrast ratio is not that great at 300:1, and I would have been willing to pay a little more to get something better, but they needed to cut some corners, and im glad that they did with the screen, instead of downgrading to weaker hardware. The 1080p is great though, and I still had a moment of awe when I was playing GTA V, and was chilling on my yacht looking at the sunset (I was bored, ok). It didn't look low quality at all, and for a moment i thought I was playing on a much better screen, so the screen is definitely lacking, but it's nothing to be worried about; you'll still have a great experience.- The mousepad sucks. It's very difficult to press both buttons at the same time (almost impossible) and it is way too sensitive right out of the box. However, I use a mouse way more than i do with the mousepad, and only really use it when im out and about. So im not too concerned with it-The webcam sucks. Looks like its 480p. I wouldnt use it for anything other than a skype call with a best friend who doesn't really care about the crappy quality of your camera. Dont use it, please.-The arrow keys on the keyboard are way too thin in my opinion. Plus they aren't really separated from the rest of the keyboard, so it's really easy to be hitting the numpad or special keys instead of the actual arrow keys. There seems to be some space on the chassis for a little bit wider keys, or some separation, so im not so sure as to why they chose to do what they did.-The speakers aren't that great. They are good for casual things. Gaming is fine with them. I did actually like the stereo positioning of them much more than my old MSI laptop. It felt way more immersive, but there is practically no bass, so explosions and such were kind of lacking in ""boom"". I was listening to music and watching some videos and I wasn't appalled by the quality, so they will surely suffice for those kinds of things. However, If you are doing some kind of content creation, whether it be with music or videos, I would obviously ditch the laptop speakers and get some real speakers.NEUTRAL:-The battery life is what you'd expect for a gaming laptop. I was getting about 3 hours on casual internet surfing, and an hour while playing GTA V. I'm not sure why some people dont understand that gaming laptops do require way more wattage than a macbook or ultrabook, and fault gaming laptops for having weak batteries. Its a fact of life right now, and it'll probably be years before we start seeing gaming laptops that can run for more than 10 hours on battery life. I usually don't game when i'm not at home, and i leave it plugged in when i am home, so this really isnt much of a problem for me.-Temperatures are OK. I would say im a little surprised by the average temps with this machine, in such a small chassis. The old laptop i had was a MSI gp60-1053 leopard pro, and my god that thing was a hulk. Keep in mind that laptop had a 950m and a dual core i5-4210h. With such low specs you would have thought it could be in a slim design and stay cool, but no, oh my god that thing got hot. Usually cpu temps were in the 90's and GPU temps in the mid 80's. However, this thing, which probably has like a 500% performance increase (I haven't actually compared the two yet so obviously that's made up) has decent temps while averaging mid 80's on the CPU and mid 70's on the GPU when i was playing GTA V for 2 hours with no thermal throttling when looking at MSI afterburner. However, it still does get hot. I dont really play any games in my lap, because I just find it uncomfortable to be using a mouse on a couch or my bed, so usually the laptop will always be on my desk when i game. However, when i am moving around, it really doesnt get annoyingly hot like some people have stated in their reviews. It gets warm, but not too warm, and unless you are wearing some heavy clothing, you shouldn't really notice it if you are watching some videos or surfing the web. (BE WARNED, IF YOU USE MSI AFTERBURNER, DONT TRY TO OVERCLOCK. 99% OF LAPTOPS AREN'T MADE TO OVERCLOCK. DO1N'T GET COCKY)-Connectivity is good. 3 usb 3.1, 1 mini display port, 1 hdmi port, 1 SD card reader (which has average speeds in 80mb/s) ethernet port (Which has a interesting design where there is a flap you have to push down in order to fit the cable in, which is a big hassle and takes longer than it should) a kensington lock, and finally only one audio/microphone in jack, which could be a problem to those who have two separate for their headphones and micCONS:- The size is great. At .9 inches and 4.9lbs, this thing is a beast for it's size. It's amazing that they are able to fit such powerful hardware into a chassis this small. Im not really sure how the Max-q 1060 laptops are going to play out though, especially when it comes to laptops like these. I feel the 20% decrease in performance to achieve low thermals a small design in the max-q laptops is not really worth it. When you consider shortening it to like .7 inches, and dropping the weight to around 3 or 4 lbs, I dont find the compromise in performance to be a good trade off. I would much rather carry around 1 or 2 more lbs, just to get my moneys worth and have a fully functional laptop 1060.- On the topic of the 1060, this card is amazing. I do have a desktop with 2 970's in SLI, and while it is nowhere near as powerful as my desktop, it still blows everything out of the water. The main reason why i got this laptop was because I wanted something mobile i could take to college, so I could game on it when im not too busy with college work, but also use it in the classroom, but not have to lug around an 8 lb msi Apache laptop. The only game that I have completely tested is GTA V, but I have every setting on very high with msaa 2x on, and im getting around 50-60fps. I decided to turn down reflection quality, grass quality, and particles quality to high, and I got a jump to a solid 60fps consistently, without it looking not as good as the very high preset. I also tested unigine valley, and got 62.7FPS on the extreme HD preset, which is pretty good in my opinion, when you think about the hardware required to get a solid framerate on those benchmarks. Also, the GL502vm is basically the exact same as the fx502vm-as73, with the exception of a 1060 6GB, and a 120hz g-sync panel. First off, a 1060 will rarely use all 6gb, because it simply isnt powerful enough to, and also, 1080p gaming rarely goes above 3gb's. Unless you plan on hooking this laptop up to a 1440p monitor, the 3gb version is the way to go, and will save you $300 if you are on a budget. (It got 11721 on 3Dmark firestrike).-The intel i7-7700hq is a monster. While it only has a 8-10% increase over the 6700hq, It still is an increase, and the price jump from a 6th gen i7 to a 7th gen i7 is really not that much, maybe $20 to $30 when i look at some of the models. The 4 cores and 8 threads have killed everything i've thrown at it, and is soooo much faster than my old 2 core 4 thread i5 on my previous laptop. It scored 750cb in cinebench r15 on the multithreaded workload, and a 140cb on the single threaded workload.- The keyboard is also very nice. It has a nice, tactile feel and nothing (besides the arrow keys) is too squished to be really annoying. The red backlight keys is a nice touch, but i would have liked to seen some aspect of RGB in this day and age of RGB everything, especially when we are already playing a $1100 premium. The keyboard does get warm, but only in the middle. The WASD key and arrow keys stay cool, even while in an intense load. However, typing something while just coming off of playing an intense game, or running countless benchmarks in the background for some reason, typing becomes a little uncomfortable with the hotter keys in the middle- The storage is good. a 128gb ssd is snappy and responsive. Boots in an average of 4 seconds. You can also upgrade it with another m.2 ssd to increase storage, or get a faster samsung m.2. The 1tb sshd is also good for your steam library and general workload. Nothing much to say about it really.In general, I think that pretty much covers everything. There were some corners cut to keep this thing under $1200, but im glad they didnt sacrifice the hardware, which really makes this laptop so compelling. If you are like me, and dont feel like spending $1500+ on a laptop, especially when you dropped $2000 on a desktop, this is a great option to save some money.

  WORKS FANTASTICALLY...For a month.This can play any game, new or old. PUBG? Smooth as butter. Overwatch? 100+ frames. DOOM 2016? No problem!Do you have 3D modeling programs to run? This bad boy can handle it.Just make sure to get as much enjoyment out of it as you can, because you only have 30 days to use it! The screen will not turn on and you'll have to send it back to ASUS headquarters for 3 weeks so they can tinker with it. If you're lucky, they'll send it back after you beg them. Just remind them to pack the power cable too, otherwise they'll forget it and you'll have to spend 5 hours on the phone trying to get it back. Maybe 5 more hours and they'll agree to ship my property back to me hahaAlso, the screen kinda has bad viewing angles. Just think about it before you drop $1100 on this machine.

  First one I ordered caught fire at the charging port during the first week. Amazon replaced. Second one now shuts down at random with battery charged as well as being connected to AC power. Amazon's return policy is 30 days. ASUS warranty is replacement only, will not refund my money despite this being an obvious lemon. I purchased this laptop to use for on site video editing - so now I'm stuck with a useless laptop I can't rely on to take to any job and I'm $1000 in the hole.

  I have to admit that this is my fourth ASUS gaming laptop purchase. They have been doing a really great job with gaming laptops for at least 5 years and I have purchased every iteration and enjoyed them all. This one, by far, had been the best experience I have had. The previous models I could play the latest games with some side effects, like having to lower some of the settings to get by because I was using a laptop. This one however is the most powerful and can keep up with concurrent desktops. The best part is, I can take this computer with me when I travel and visit friends to show them sick plays on the games I play. Although the sick plays are mostly by other people who I just happen to be near...I now can pick whoever I want first in Overwatch. I routinely beat my friends with 800 pound desktop machines into lobbies. That said just be aware that the ssd is small and you will be doing some game swapping until you buy that extra ssd for hdd #2. I did that already and getting the bottom off the laptop was not difficult and should not be too hard even for a beginner if said beginner takes his or her time and keeps track of the screws.With this laptop I play Overwatch on Epic settings without missing a beat, but of course I switch it to low when I am try harding. Total War Warhammer II on max settings runs just fine even in big battles. I am trying to think of other games that would show how powerful this little guy is but trust me as of December 2017 this will run the latest and greatest games at high settings with no issues.

  The laptop is starting to massively overheat after half an hour of gaming, have already had games crash on me in-game from overheating.. Had to buy an extra cooling pad just to try to cool it down while gaming and it still does not justice to the heat.. The battery life sucks on it, don't even get 2 hours of just browsing the web if it's not plugged in... I LOVED this laptop for the first 7 months of its life, now I'm just more and more frustrated with it and looking at getting a desktop so I don't have to game on this anymore... I'm hoping this came with a 1 year manufacturer warranty so I can try to see if it's something internally wrong with the system, but for anyone buying I suggest you buy a warranty

  This is a beautiful system on paper, but when I started to set it up and it went through the dialog for setting up Windows, it got to the point where it asked for network setup.  I clicked on the network, but it then went to a screen with a pulldown list and nothing on it.  I couldn't go back, so eventually I selected 'didn't have Internet"" to get the setup later.  When it finally started up, there was no network adapters or drivers set up so I couldn't connect to the Internet.  I couldn't find any way to restart the dialog, so I did a reset of the PC to reinstall Windows.  I did the reset and the dialog restarted, but it got to selecting my area (the US), and at that input it went into a ""just a moment"" loop, and it takes a very long (one minute) loop between steps.  I finally got to the ""lets connect you to a network"" step, but if offers me no network choices to connect to.  I had to connect via Ethernet to go on.  It did a bunch of windows and Asus updates.  I'm still trying to get wifi to work but I may have to return it.**Edit:  Asus support went through a long diagnosis and correction process and told me that the WLAN adapter was faulty in the system.  I initiated a return through Amazon.  Will update when that process completes.**Edit:  I returned the laptop, but the seller withheld a restocking fee despite the fact that the item was DOA.  When I objected, they then said that I had failed to return the USB dongle that came with the unit.  I returned EVERYTHING that came with it, including even the foam keyboard protector and the plastic wrap the laptop came in.  I've protested their actions to Amazon.**Edit:  Amazon made good on the refund of the restocking fee.  My advice to those who buy this unit is to watch carefully during Windows setup.  Once you've gotten past the language and keyboard piece, it will move on to set up a network connection.  If this stage doesn't work, meaning you don't get any wireless network setup options, power down and request a return of the unit.  if the WLAN adapter isn't found at this point, it's never going to be.

  I really wanted to try to dual screen so I got this, just newly realsed zen duo with the 16gb. I was zippy fast and I loved it, but had to return because the right click button on the touch pad did not work. 2 finger click did work but the physical right button one uses with one's thumb itself did not work.  Im hoping it was just my unit and not a defect with other people. The 8gb version was out for a few months longer and non of the reviews show other people with this issue.

  Unfortunately I had to return this laptop.  Here's why:The machine I received will not charge the battery.The first day I received it, I charged it all day.After more than 8 hours of charging, I unplugged it, and took it into my den to use while I watched TV.  I noticed that the battery indicated 100% charge several hours after I had unplugged it, and did not give that much thought except to think wow, this machine has a pretty strong battery.Sometime after that, the machine suddenly died.I plugged it in, and the next morning noticed that it had not charged, and the battery icon had an ""X"" in it.  Clicking on the battery icon, it showed ""Battery not Present"".  Picture of this attached.  Mind you, I had only received the laptop the day before this.I contacted ASUS by chat, and they had me do some stuff -- screen shot of what I did is attached.  This allowed the battery to charge back up, but exactly the same thing happened again, that is, once the battery ran down, the battery would not charge, and the battery indicated 100% until it ran down.I contacted ASUS again, and this time they had me restore the OS using Windows Recovery - Restore this PC.  This again allowed the battery to charge, but again it indicated 100% until it ran down, then indicated the battery was not present and will not charge.As long as the laptop is connected to the power supply, it works fine.  Very fast, good display, etc.Obviously there is something wrong with it, so I returned it.0 stars for the laptop, but ASUS service was easy to get in touch with and did what they could.  And Amazon made the return very easy.0 stars for Amazon packing.  They just put the box the laptop came in into another box with no packing material except a piece of crumpled up paper.  The box the laptop in was free to bounce around in this box, although it was not damaged that I could see.  I have to wonder if the packing at the Amazon fulfillment center is completely done by robots?  Perhaps the time and money saved is greater than than the shipping damage.

  UPDATE: 06/18/20 - The beast continues to perform without missing a beat! I have since maxed out the RAM to 32 GB (2 x 16 GB RAM) and it has no problem running any games at max settings! Currently playng COD Modern Warfare/Warzone without any issues.LOVE LOVE LOVE ASUS!!!My next upgrade down the road? Beef up the graphics car, although with this much RAM I won't need to for a long time.Pros:Very happy overall with this laptop. Excellent performance & built well. Comfortable and responsive keyboard. Keys highly visible in darkness with the red back-lit feature. The display resolution, color, clarity, and brilliance is amazing! This baby can handle existing games at highest settings as well as many of the new titles that are out/will be out. Can't wait to see how it handles Sea of Thieves next month, but based on the recommended game settings from the publisher, it looks like it will handle the game very well at medium to high settings.Cons (Not a big deal though):1. No light indicator to let you know if your Caps, Num or Scroll locks are on or off.2. While gaming, the fan gets pretty loud after a while. Not really an issue if you wear a headset, but keep your left hand away from the exhaust vent. That air blowing out is HOT!Lastly, this is a complaint about Amazon regarding their shipping department. Would it KILL Amazon to use some padding?The laptop arrived in an Amazon box - Which contained the laptop in it's original packaging and a little bit of brown paper. I opened it to find it damaged (Not sure if it was from shipping or from the Manufacturer when packing). Sent it back for a replacement. 2 days later the replacement arrived.....Same kind of Amazon box with the product inside, only this time there was NO PACKING MATERIAL AT ALL. It was just the product box by itself.....Seriously Amazon?Luckily, the replacement was undamaged. As of this review, it's been up and running for 3 and a half days now without problems.First 2 photos are the first laptop that was damaged on arrival. The rest are of the replacement.

  Purchased the 17"" GTX 1050 ti version and cracked it open to upgrade to an NVME system drive and 16Gb of Ram. As you can see, the laptop doesn't match the advertised pictures with dual fans and heatsinks. This machine, before replacing the thermal compound, was throttling constantly under load while gaming and GPU benchmarking. After replacing the thermal paste, even with Asus Gaming app running fans at 80% constantly (a number generally associated with longevity of fan bearings) I'm still seeing CPU temps of 90¬∞+ on medium load games like Warframe. Because of the layout, all of the heat is being transferred over the top of the GPU and the system is consistently warmer than I would have expected considering I was expecting a dual fan layout and this is one of the reasons I purchased the laptop.Heat is just the tip of the iceberg, though. After adding 8Gb of memory and a 250Gb NVME drive and installing Windows on the new drive is where the nightmare began. The picture in the description lists this as an FX503, the label identifies as FX73VE but dxdiag reports this as a ROG gaming laptop. So finding the right driviers was a bit of a nightmare and I still believe as of writing this that the display is either 60hz or it's not being recognized as 120hz, which is how it's advertised, again.For $800 this isn't a bad machine with about $200 and an hour of time thrown at it. Out  of the box it has plenty of I/O, decent upgradability, a good processor and a decent GPU. However, with stock cooling, mechanical HDD, and 1050 ti don't expect this to perform at a 5 star level. As others have said, spend $300-400 more on something with more memory, SSD, GTX 1060, and better cooling.

  Purchased at Best Buy in January for $1550. Has a lovely 4k screen of a very best quality and worked great. Until I got my pin logon wrong too many times from cleaning it a few days ago. I tried to reset it to factory as instructed by ASUS, but there's no bootable image sector on the hard drive so it says to contact ASUS for assistance. I sent them a photo of the screen and they referred me to purchase a USB bootable image for  $50. Doesn't a new PC purchase include a copy of windows either on a bootable partition and then you can get a USB recovery stick for no cost if needed? I had the same issue with an Acer gaming laptop two years I bought new and they did it right, sent me a USB bootable image in the mail. I spent hours on text chat via Twitter and Facebook only to get to a dead end for there's no telephone customer service nor tech support. They actually replied, We hope you enjoy having your problem solved now. I  replied, no, I still have a, 'bricked,' fairly new $1500 gaming laptop which should at least be bootable with a generic Windows USB I can make on my other PC, but it won't allow that as ASUS intentionally disabled that feature. This is to ensure everyone, even those very seasoned on PC's, to have to use Geeksquad or ASUS repair services at great cost. During the text chats, they told me they could not send a bootable USB, and then two hours later they referred to a site that sells them. ASUS, I'm building my next PC from scratch. Shame for I wanted a portable 4k laptop instead of full tower requiring AC power all the time.

  Four years ago, I had purchased a Lenovo Yoga 900, and it has already heavily worn out. I decided to do some research and found this laptop. While I love this model of Asus Zenbook for many reasons, I would recommend going with a different model of the Zenbook. I'll go through my general pros and cons of this model of the computer and my recommendation. If you don't want to read my explanation, you can just see the aspect in all caps.PROS:BUILD QUALITY: the computer has an excellent build quality in terms of its all-aluminum body, and the keyboard has the perfect amount of travel, especially compared to the Yoga, which sacrificed the keyboard for thinness. The screen is excellent for a1080p, and the thin bezels are very lovely. The ergonomic lifting hinge is pretty nice though you don't notice it until you aren't typing on another laptop keyboard. The ScreenPad works well, but I have more to say in the cons. this is my first computer with the iris scanner, and it is the greatest thing!INTERFACE: it has Windows 10 64-bit; there isn't that much bloatware from Asus on the computer. The MyAsus app on the computer which can update the BIOS on the computer and have some nice customizations to the laptop. The app includes options like partially charging the battery if you're leaving the computer plugged in often to protect the battery life, fan function, screen color customizations, diagnostic checks, warranty info, and manuals for the laptop.INNER SPECS: While inner specs are subjective to use, this laptop specs are pretty good for a business laptop or for a college student who plays light games (that is me) should guarantee that this laptop will run reliably for a good while. There is a lot of hubbub around the Intel i7 10 gen with the clocking speeds, but the results are relatively similar to the older generations, and if its an issue, this laptop has options for other generations. This laptop also has the ultrabook (thin laptop) version of the i7 inside.BATTERY: the battery on this laptop holds out for a good while if you're writing a paper or watching youtube videos, and while the charger isn't USB C, it charges the laptop pretty dang fast.FREE CASE: this model also comes with a free case, which is great for protecting this laptop in bags. It's not a fancy case, but it does the job.CONS:SCREEENPAD: The ScreenPad is overrated. There I said it. Once the new toy factor wore off, I turned it off to save battery life. While it sounds like a cool idea in concept, it isn't that useful. Lucky for you, they have a model of this laptop without the ScreenPad and a regular trackpad. I haven't had any issues with the ScreenPad; it just isn't justifiable for paying more.KEYBOARD: while the keyboard feels great for long periods of writing, the only problem I have noticed is the slight slanting of the backspace key. Maybe it's just my typing; I don't know. luckily this computer comes with a 2-year warrantyFINGERPRINTS: this computer is a fingerprint magnet, which isn't the end of the world, but just so you know.Conclusion: Overall, as I had said before, I would highly recommend you get a model of the Asus Zenbook 13,14 or 15 in, just not this one specifically. Get a model that doesn't have the Screenpad. Don't make the same mistake I made in being enticed by the ScreenPad and save your hard-earned coin to purchase the 4-year warranty offer for this computer by amazon our through Asus on the MyAsus app.

  This is essentially a very good laptop at a good price. Having discreet video in something very light weight and thin is a blessing, and the 6 core 10th Generation i7 and 16 gig of RAM makes this laptop fly at multitasking. I really thought the idea behind the multi-function touchpad was pretty cool at first, but it can be a little annoying because it really wants to be something other than just a touchpad even when that's all I want it to be. I have to keep switching it back because coming too close to the bottom keeps switching it to one of the other functions. At my desk, though, with a mouse and keyboard and multiple monitors, this is an excellent laptop that handles everything I want it to do.

  At the time of this review I've had this laptop for about 5 days. So far, this laptop has exceeded my expectations, and reminded me how much I missed having a laptop. It's not a touch screen but it does have a touch screen (more on that later), and it's only 1080p which is why I rated screen quality only a 4 out of 5. It is a nice screen though, and the lack of bezel is outstanding. I was originally looking at the 13"" version and had made up my mind. In the time that I took to decide it had sold out. So, I went to the 14"" as the backup plan, and I‚Äôm so glad it worked out this way! I had been comparing measurements with the Apple Mac Book because of their reputation for portability.  The lack of bezel has allowed the 14‚Äù laptop to be the same or smaller in every dimension. The fact that the overall size of this is roughly the same as a 13"" MacBook but I get a 14"" display is really something I am happy with, despite the lower resolution.The aluminum frame, lack of bezel, backlit keyboard, screen pad in addition to the 10th generation i7u processor, 16GB of RAM, and the 512GB SSD (upgradeable to 1TB). Give this laptop a premium feel from top to bottom. I do wish that this laptop was at least 1440p though.The touch pad has been both annoying and impressive. I‚Äôve gotten the settings mostly dialed in and usually keep it off when on battery power. In many of the ways that matter it just behaves as simply second monitor. I have found it works great for chat windows, Spotify, and picture heavy tutorials, especially when you use an external mouse. That really is a cool little productivity feature even if it has limited usefulness. My biggest complaint with it is that icons are not standard desktop icons so right click functionality doesn‚Äôt work and to setup an icon to return to the app rather than just the current app instance on the screen you have to go through a special process with contextual popups on the main screen. There is a learning curve, but, in general, I think they are on to something here.The battery life indicator is super inaccurate always saying I only have 2 or 4 hours of battery left even when my battery is at 90%. I think that‚Äôs a Windows issue though, not an issue with the PC configuration. The battery has lasted entire workdays a couple times now. I have no complaints.The choice for a legacy USB 2.0 port instead of a Thunderbolt 3 port or at least a USB 3.1 A port is baffling to me. Sure, it has become the default for my wireless mouse‚Äôs dongle, but I‚Äôm already looking at Bluetooth mice. Who wants to ruin this slim profile with a dongle?

  Up to now, I have a good impression of this laptop. I use Linux mostly, so I installed Linux (mint) successfully, but it was not able to get dual boot without to erase the windows partition and modifying the bios value. Anyways it works and looks fantastic. It has the right size to work and bring it with you everywhere.

  Update:After using this system for about 3 months I can definitely tell you the screenpad is a gimmick. Id rather them include a Thunderbolt 3 port instead of the screenpad tbh. Overall though, it's holding up incredibly well performance wise (Can run some games Like Arkham Knight and Halo MCC as well as some 1080p video editing). Definitely would still recommend.Original:A powerful system with a great design, lightweight, and surprisingly good sound. Screen isn't too bright tho for outdoor usage but it's still an excellent panel. The second screen is a bit gimmicky but points for innovation. Overall it's a very capable and solid all-rounder that can last through an entire day's work üí™.An easy 5 stars

  After having the Computer for 2 days this is my verdict, if anything extreme changes I'll of course be editing this review.Monitor first impressions:Asus did an excellent job with price to performance here. The monitor is bright but not overly saturated and the colours are nice a vivid. Make sure to keep the laptop plugged in if your looking for the best in eye candy.Regarding Ram:The single stick of ram is enough of operating multiple low grade tasks at once but I recommend installing a second stick of ram if you plan on doing some heavy end multitasking with demanding software. With that said the installation process of the ram was difficult due to the bottom panel to the laptop not being module based so you have to expose the entire motherboard for installation. Putting the panel back was difficult due to the fact that the bottom panel was slightly larger and so screwing everything back in place was difficult.Keyboard:The Keyboard has very nice switches and is higher end then a few others I've tried in the mid tier class such as the Dell G5, HP, and Lenovo Legion. I'm very pleased with the keyboard thus far and will update if I run into any issues.Battery Longevity:The battery typically lasts a little under 5 hours while operating at a half battery saving capacity under low work loads (browsing & downloading). With that said the computer does get hot rather fast if you are working longer than 2 hours at low to moderate processing power. Lastly expect no more than 1 1/2 hours while working the computer at max CPU capacity and it'll get hot fast. (Fix: try to keep this laptop plugged in when ever possible).Laptop Fans & Heat:The fans kick on relatively fast when first booting up the machine, the laptops fans do get moderately loud and over time at medium to high work load the laptop will get uncomfortably hot. (Fix: get a laptop stand fan stand *a good one is about $35 when not on sale). Haven't had issues since I got a medium grade laptop fan standFor Perfamance refer to the Benchmark as it's proven to be accurate thusfar.Consensus:You get a powerful laptop with a remarkable monitor to boot. Upgrading ram was a pain but that could have been an oddity on mine. The Keyboard feels like I'm really getting a mid to high tier laptop experience. You should strongly consider getting a device to cool down and promote airflow for the laptop if you expect to be putting the laptop through the ringer with demanding software and with that said getting another stick of ram for duel channel utilisation helps windows run even smoother while multitasking. I would recommend this laptop to a friend who was looking for a price to performance computer for business, software editing, and mid tier to almost high tier gaming. I expect to use this laptop for at least the next 3 years and expect not much in loss of Perfamance to Time Quality.

  Pros:Smoothest experience I've had with a laptop screen. The fluidity is insane and I couldn't ask for a higher refresh rateBeautiful design and quality. Honestly, the grayish winter blue is far more beautiful than the traditional black.Great performance. I've had it for 3 months now and can say that it hasn't failed me in the performance department yet.Best anti-glare screen I've used so far.Has great battery life when optimized. Upwards to 5 1/2 hours which is good for a gaming laptopConsCan get very hot. You can burn your skin on this thing. It worries me how hot this thing can get. Upwards to 86 degrees celsius before it starts to cool itself down. Despite this, it hasn't seen a decrease in performance so...The fans can be very loud. That's just the laptop doing what it needs to do though. The sound is not overbearing or anything.The speakers are below par when it comes to other speakers in the price range.Overall, I've been enjoying a hell of a lot! Great purchase would recommend.

  This machine is incredible if you are willing to spend the money. As can be seen in nearly all other reviews here on Amazon, it has great performance, decent battery life, and good build quality. Besides no biometrics such as Windows Hello, or a fingerprint reader, I don't see any other major downsides stopping anyone from buying it. All around, it is a solid purchase, and (in my opinion) is worth every penny.

  Very small and lightweight. Runs so smooth and very quiet. Even with fans at 100% still very quiet for a gaming pc. Always been a asus rog fan and always will be. Very well built and durable feels tough but still so light. And I‚Äôm very impressed with the size very easy to throw into a backpack and take with you. In battery saver mode the battery has lasted me a couple hours doing work. Then plug it in and turn on a game.

  I love this laptop. Blue is my favorite color. It's inspiring to look at everytime; however, Asus went cheap on the inside and bottom, using cheaper plastic instead of the brushed metal you see on the lid. The hinges are also cheap-looking, but hey-- functionally, they work a MILLION times better than that trash you call Lenovo.Price-performance-wise, get the Zephyrus G14. But if you want a beautiful blue laptop, then this is the one.The speakers were cheap compared to my HP laptop unfortunately, and that alone made me consider returning the laptop at first for the whole first month, but I got used to it. The trackpad is kind of rough on the fingers too tbh, they could've used a much sleeker material... but it is what it is.The 240HZ display is of course beautiful with gaming, the Nvidia 1660ti running most any game in the highest settings without a hiccup.The fans get really loud on Turbo (highest setting), so you might want an external speaker for the sound or headphones. Running normal processes you can just use Silent Mode or Performance Mode where the fans aren't so loud.For how big the screen is, it's super lightweight. I love it. Very portable, too. The charger is kinda big, but eh you get used to it.You get charged a premium for the blue color, but tbh I wouldn't have bought this laptop if it weren't for that blue color. There were literally a ton of other better price-performance options. But I'm happy this one aligns with my design sense. I just wish that ASUS put the same love toward the interior of the laptop at least... Feels cheap on the inside when compared to the outer look.So-- should you get this laptop? Only if you want a blue laptop.Otherwise, go search the market for better options.

  So I went to go add another name m.2 ssd into my a15, it's advertised as having an additional m.2 slot, which in fact doesn't.

  After looking at most of the gaming laptops available for $800, this is by far the best mainly for the 512 gig HD which is twice as large as all of the other laptops in this price range. After playing many games and having multiple programs running (multitabbed Chrome, VLC playing movies, whilst also playing games which I shall list shortly), I find that only having 8 gigs of ram (and of course the 4 gigs of video ram), this laptop has very little stuttering/lag while switching between said programs. I was pleasantly surprised at how great it performs with only 8 gigs, that I might not even bother with getting it up to 16 at some future date.The only downside to this laptop that I find after nearly 4 weeks of use is the battery life, because playing a game with only a battery would at best give me an hour and a half of uptime. But honestly, who buys a gaming laptop expecting to play games without it being plugged in you know what I mean? If you need battery life, look elsewhere, but for everything else, this is a great bargain for around 800 US.Below is my list of games and the performance I got with this laptop with mostly max settings:Elite Dangerous - 80+ fpsRome Total War 2 - 100+ fpsNo Man's Sky - 100+ fpsStar Wars The Old Republic (on station with hundreds of players) 120+ fpsCivilization 6 (DX12) 70+ fpsPlayer Unknown Battleground 100+fpsI have to say the 1650 GPU combined with the outstanding Ryzen gives magnificent gaming for such a good price. For 1080p gaming you really don't need anything better. As far as plugging this into a 4k tv/monitor, I wouldn't know, but I plan on doing it in the future if for anything to play some more forgivable games and I will update this review for when I do. But for now, I highly recommend this laptop.

  First and foremost, the listing shows dual m.2 drive slots, and this is NOT the case.  This is a single m.2 slot laptop so like others I ordered the extra drive to put in it, and it is unusable unless you have a way to mirror the software from one stick to another.Other than that, the screen is bright and the anti-glare is great.  Speed for the Ryzen 5 is solid, but you definitely want to upgrade the ram to 16GB almost immediately if you want to do anything besides browse the web and light duty stuff.  Even to play something small or older you will want the extra ram (~$50).Not a lot of bloatware on the laptop either.  Comes with McAfee which is easy enough to take out, along with the trial of Office 365.  Both removable with a couple clicks.

  I honestly think this laptop is a great starter laptop despite only having it for a week I think it's great for light gamers. Maybe not so much for extreme gamers but you get what you pay for it is also good for video editing and live to streaming for beginners too. The laptop was recommended by a friend and amazon live streamer so give him a shout out to David @ Utechpia.com and tell him Exploring With Pudgy sent you.

  This model does not have the additional SSD port that's advertised. It does have the SATA SSD slot for 2.5"". The speakers are not very loud at all. In fact, my Pixel 4a 5g is many times louder and it's just a cell phone. After taking the back off to add ram and sata ssd I noticed the bottom cover clips do not snap all the way in place by the rear exhaust openings even after putting screws in. Other than those things it seems to be decent for the money compared to what's currently available.

  I will be updating this review whenever is needed.I ordered it from Colombia and only took 4 business days to be here, something I appreciate. The combination of SSD, 12Gb, Mx250 and i7 8th is perfect for me. The system is so fast that I can work with Photoshop while running many other programs without any problem or lag. Gaming has been a plus on this device, always using medium-high quality for heavy games, and the most important is that you dont have heating issues as most thin laptops have. The feeling and texture of this laptop feels premium, thin and metallic, the typing feels good and screenpad is big enough even bigger than in most laptops so its always nice to use it even when I am used to a wireless mouse. Oh the screen! It's not 4k but honestly I am very happy with this one, the black-mate finish is nice for keeping your screen private at public places and trust me it doesnt get dirt as fasts as others types of screens, I've used the laptop at Coffee shops with low bright using battery savig mode without any problem.Battery! I know is not a big battery, but just use the battery saving mode whenever you leave home or the plug charger, it gives you 5 hours and I am sure you will not need the best performance while using battery so that is what I do, perfect for college and work.Theres only 1 cons so far, the screenpad 2.0 software still needs to be updated and filled with many other popular apps since asus apps don't have too many options for it. In any case, you can always move any window from the screen to the screenpad so that is always helpful and gives you thousands of possibilities.I wish I could explain you more or give you a better review but english is not my first language and I am doing what I can :)

  When u first get it make a system image unto a usb drive. Take off back cover and you can remove the main hardrive and replace it with Intel 660p M.2 2280 2TB NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) SSDPEKNW020T8X1. Boot windows unto that and u have a hardrive with 2 terabytes space and awesome graphics. If u booted system image correctly it should use that. Just remember to take the old hardrive out of the heat sleeve and place the intel one inside of it before screwing it in (dont mess with the gum like heat resistant pad either.Memory can be replaced forCrucial 16GB Single DDR4 2666 MT/s (PC4-21300) DR X8 SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT16G4SFD8266 or something bigger and faster if u can find DDR4 3100 which is even faster. This yeilds 20 gb of Ram.There should be one more slot empty, for that fosa Module Adapter for Optane Memory Module 16GB PCIe NVMe M.2 2280 3D Xpoint(32GB) should work at boosting memory even more.Games such as GW2 play very well. I don;t know how other titles would fare. Performance is quite fast, and one can overlook the price of the laptop and pricey upgrades for how it will overall run.There is on thing u lose from doing such and that the apps buttons on the touchpad which is a useless gimmick for a gamer anyways. And this is only if u replace the hardrive (again if u do, put replacement in the same sleeve u took old ssd drive out of) This is important to not let it get hot.Unparking Cpus, and of course softare like Driver booster will quickly have all the updates the components need. I love this laptop!

  So here are a few complaints on ASUS and this laptop.1. ASUS customer support is oblivious when it comes to product specification (I asked on Amazon product Q&A, Asus Chat Support, Asus E-Mail Support) and all three provide different (or no) specifications.2. This laptop is quite noisy. Just opening Chrome turns the fan on as if I'm playing some light game.3. It is NOT upgradable to 16GB. Some reviewers here are bold enough to state it is, until I bought one and a 16GB DDR4 Corsair RAM and installed it and it refused to start up.4. Not sure if this is the laptop, the OS it ships with or just Windows. I had to face ridiculous issues like the laptop going to sleep way too early (5 mins, even though I set sleep to Never), sound being extremely tiny (which appears to be fixed now.. not sure if it's temporary). Note that the laptop is working fine now.5. Navigation buttons are tiny. Need getting used to.6. Keys are white, backlights are white. Figure that out. But since the backlights can be switched off, I'm fine with this.The Good Stuff1. It is powerful. For me i5-8265U is good enough. Mind you I came from i5-2300M, so it's a considerable jump.2. ScreenPad is good, but I ended up turning it off and using it as a conventional trackpad.3. Battery is okay? Around 8 hrs of browsing, or 4.5hrs of Android Studio with emulator (disclaimer: I did not use it all until it reaches 0. I simply averaged the battery estimate Windows provides).The Little Things that Matter (Don't judge me why I think they matter)1. NumPad (7 and 1) can be used as Home and End buttons, which is helpful for developers.2. There is an Fn button for Screen Clipping!The Rest1. Sound is okay at best.2. It gets pretty hot around key 0, -, =.3. I find key travel pleasing.4. (Not an expert) screen quality is acceptable for me.5. Silver body is easily scratchable. I left a lot of scratches when trying to pry open this laptop to install the 16GB RAM that resulted in vain.

  This little laptop, far slimmer than my previous gaming laptop, packs an impressive set of hardware that allows me to run games like Doom Eternal at maximum settings and still get well over 100 fps.  A very nice surprise was the incredible quality of the built-in speakers.  They pack an impressive amount of bass that I have not heard come from laptop speakers before.  All my music and movies sound absolutely incredible!  To be completely honest, there is nothing that I don't like about this machine.  It has everything I need plus some, and I have had a bunch of fun with it!  Excellent product, highly recommended!

  June 17, 2019: ASUS support tells me that I must send the machine for additional test/repairs. UNACCEPTABLE. The tech I worked with over a month ago told me that if the problem returned my machine would be replaced.  I will not send this back in. The only acceptable resolution is replacement. I've lost literally months while this machine went back and forth to the ASUS repair facility and I'm still stuck with brick.  I will never buy another ASUS computer. This is literally the worst computer purchase I've ever made and I've been using these things since the late 1980s.June 13, 2019: THIS COMPUTER LITERALLY CAME BACK FROM THE REPAIR FACILITY FOR THE SECOND TIME LESS THAN A WEEK AGO and the issues have returned AGAIN. I'll never buy another ASUS product. This is garbage, the brand is garbage and I just want my machine replaced or money returned. This is absurd. If I could give this machine a negative rating I would...I've brought my rating down to one star. You can see my original review after my update.Update:The problem with the fans grew worse. I tried updating all the drivers and this failed to fix the problem. I contacted support and spent about thirty minutes walking through the issue with them. They issued and RMA and I sent the computer out for a warranty repair. My computer was out for about three weeks and when it was returned to me, the problem was alleviated, but only for about a week, at which time the fans gradually spun up more and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time.  Right now, the fans have literally been running, and they are VERY LOUD for the past two hours. I'll close the laptop and the fans will spin down, but within half an hour, they spin up again. The computer actually woke me up last night when the fans kicked in (with the laptop closed).I spoke to support again, and this time the agent told me the behavior was normal. Okay, right.In addition, this computer's track pad is the worst I've ever had.  It's almost unusable.I regret purchasing this machine. It is absolutely the worst computer purchase I've ever made.OriginalI bought this computer primarily for a mobile DAW. In general, it supports everything I do in terms of audio recording and editing. However, there's a couple caveats I feel I must share with others. 1. The fans are running for no apparent reason. They are tremendously loud and in fact they've been running since I turned on the computer 5 minutes ago. I've disabled all but the essential startup items and currently I am running only Chrome. No other applications are running. The computer isn't even warm. It's really annoying. I was one version behind on the BIOS, so I flashed it with the latest. No change. 2. The track pad isn't great. Sometimes it's weirdly sensitive and mistakes a scroll for a click. Other times scrolling is difficult (it will scroll smoothly and suddenly stumbles requiring that I move the cursor to the side and try again. If that doesn't work I just go to the scroll bar and go from there.So while the computer is suited to my needs, it's drawbacks are very frustrating. I'm considering sending it back.

  i bought the rtx2070 512m2 16gb. I would give it 4.7 stars if i could. its a great laptop but its not perfect.If you plan on playing games you really need to buy an extra stick of memory with the 16gb model. Games will run mediocre without it but ur frame rates will increase 90-110% when you add the 2nd channel (depending on the game). Shadow of the tomb raider averaged 50fps with med-high settings with 1 channel, it jumped to over 90 fps with ultra high settings. Resident evil 2 remake went from 60-85 to 105-144 (cus vsync probably) on highest settings.It's great for work. The 144hz panel makes everything look smooth. I got lucky, my panel only has a little light bleed in the corners and can only be seen when the screen goes completely dark.Fans are loud. Use headphones. The speakers are pretty good, u need to turn it up really loud to over power the fans.  Panel is not gsync.. but 144hz so doesn't really matter.update: Worked great for about 3 weeks. Then the graphics card decided to disconnect itself from the computer. Couldn't find it in bios. My guess is high temps probably loosened a solder joint. I still like the computer so i ordered a replacement.

  The pros:1. Beautiful screen2. Solid build3. Easy to upgrade (ram or storage)4. The speaker sounds great5. Easy to monitoring the basic information by software and control the fans and colour of the keyboard (Armoury Crate)The cons1. Touch pad not big enough2. Fans maybe too loud when overboost mode3. Blue screen issues (I think it‚Äôs just a individual problem but it‚Äôs happened when I play game)When I playing game, this laptop provide a beautiful display and good sound quality to me to enjoy. Unfortunately, my laptop seem have something wrong (software or hardware problem), it always blue screen when playing game and I try to fix it (e.g. update the driver or windows) by finding the solution on internet but the situation still happen. Another problem is after I install GeForce Experience, it might have a weird colour dots randomly appear and the laptop might going to freeze or blue screen.I returned this product and it delivered to return center over a weeks but I still waiting for my refund. Unlucky and Disappointed experience I shops on amazon!

  The good: Initially pleased with product at unboxing.  Was pleased with minimal bloatware (except McAffee which comes preloaded and pushy). Device has a cool appearance. Easy to change backlit keyboard colors etc and overall solid construction. Snappy responses for basic apps.The Meh: It is a large, heavy laptop. At the outer edge of what I consider portable. But fine for my purposes which don't require constant movement. Screen quality is very average.The Bad: On the 3rd startup the network adapter failed to appear. Device basically showed that no wifi card was installed. 2 hours of troubleshooting and ASUS support recommended I return it. Also, while it was working I ran some basic diagnostics and performance. While CPU appeared fast, graphics and overall performance did not equal the sum of the parts as I expected. Perhaps if I had it longer I could have tweaked.

  This is a good laptop, but there are some flaws. I like the hardware, the laptop is solid, the cooling is good. I don‚Äôt regret buying this in anyway.Here are the flaws:The cord going from the power brick to the computer is very short, barely goes from the plug on the computer to the floor. Nothing worse than it hanging off the floor Delma table that is a little higher than normal. They should have added 2 feet to the cord.All the inputs are on the left side. They should have added one USB to the right side, especially for gaming mouses.They should have had a USB C port, no excuses for a laptop of this price and parts to not have it. It should have had it.The final issue is a software issue. That stupid MyASUS is a horrible program and asks to update every 10 minutes and despite clicking Update it won‚Äôt. Going to the Windows App Store and updating won‚Äôt solve it either. Total garbage. Just delete it and manually update everything yourself.

  Laptop battery was 0% when arrived, Downloaded steam, started Halo: Reach. ran good for a few minutes fan started getting loud and crashed. Now it just crashes every time a game is started. Reach runs perfect on my Desktop...

(Viewing angle and contrast is awful)Cons:Besides it crashes now every time a game is playedLaptop build quality is cheap plastic made to look like metal.RGB keyboard is only one zone and is brighter on some keys.Fan is very loud on normal setting, at silent it is still audible and the FPS tanks.Very limited I/O and cheap looking screen. Very cheap speakers no subwoofer and no bass on stereo speakers.HDMI only so you're capped at 60FPS at 4k. what a shame.Huge 1.5"" Chin under the screen.Unacceptable camera. any phone from 10 years ago looks better.Mcafee spyware preinstalled.

  Had unit for 2 months, began making loud noises internally. Of course I was past the 30 day return window. Currently fighting with asus to make this right. Laptop sounds like a wood chipper at idle/general windows tasks. Runs games a short period of time and then crashes. Dissapoonted, hoping for a refund so I can purchase a more quality product .Update: ASUS offered very little other then restoring laptop and clear this, delete that, when it was obviously a hardware failure. I replaced the Faulty CPU fan myself for 25.00 and 20 minutes of time. Far less frustrating than dealing with terrible customer service.

  The WIFI continually cuts out on this device which requires the adapter to be reset before it can be used again. After months with this issue,  I sent it in for a RMA where they ""Tightened the WIFI cable"" an updated the BIOS which did absolutely nothing to address my issue. So far, I'm out $50 for the box and shipping and have absolutely nothing to show for it. I asked for support via email and its been two weeks and all they have asked is what is my wifi driver version and Windows 10 version. It's 3-4 days in-between generic email responses that ask questions I have already answered multiple times.This is the absolute worst customer service I have experienced with a laptop company and will never recommend anyone to buy ASUS products now or in the future.

  I used to think Asus was a decent company but this is the second under performer I have purchased from them.It is an unreliable piece of trash. Windows 10 is buggy as hell and stupid crap is constantly breaking. Now I can't get the headphones to work. Yesterday it was the mousepad. And this is a brand new laptop.Last Asus I'm buying. I want my money back.Update... USB peripherals no longer being recognized... tried to restart the computer... stuck at restarting screen...Now Windows locks up if the laptop is unplugged with the monitor closed.And as if that wasn't the worst part they market this as a gaming laptop.. but it can't even cool itself and you regularly experience frame rate drops EVERY time the temp spikes and I'm sitting in front of the air conditioner.Update: After 5 months and about 29 days of ownership this laptop overheats so fast it has become useless. Thanks for nothing ASUS.Update: Still disputing ASUS after sending them a screenshot of their own software clocking the CPU temp at 100¬∞ Celcius. ""Roll back drivers. Flash BIOS."" They have me running in circles and jumping through hoops but my CPU is still 100¬∞ Celcius.Update: Pop open laptop. Find fans clogged. Y'all my 10+ year old Panasonic CF-31 is an actual Mil-Spec laptop... it doesn't have these issues. Turn to page 21 of ""Improving Fan System Performance"" by the Department of Energy and it reads ""A consequence of backward-incline blade orientation is a low angle of impingement with the airstream. This promotes the accumulation of particulates on the fan blades, which can create performance problems.""Try harder ASUS.Update: ASUS had to swap out a lot of internals. From the looks of things I (and other experienced technicians I showed the unit to once it was back in my custody) came to the conclusion that at least the motherboard and CPU were swapped out. ASUS tried to keep the NVMe storage from before... this wasn't helpful. It corrupted the Windows 10 install. The only thing that finally brought it back was a total factory reset, new Win10 install, and finally, after all this time, a minimally functioning laptop. It's October. This laptop was ordered in February. Shop elsewhere people.Update 2020/10/28:So after LITERALLY months of back and forth I called out Asus on actually NAMING the third party lab that certified their components as ""Mil-Spec"". They DID say they forwarded the pictures of the fan blades covered in dust along with my Department of Energy fan design citation to "" our technical product manager and R&D for a follow-up"". I received this last email on October 20th, 2020 at 6:30 PM EST. They said they would get back to me in 1-2 business days. It's been over a week and nothing. I never heard who that third part Mil-Spec certifying lab was so I can only conclude that like Ford releasing known bad transmissions, it only ever passed ""internal tests"".Allegedly I was speaking to ""Robert T. - Service Department for ASUS Office of the CEO""I don't know what else to say. Their quality has tanked over the years and they spend all their time gas-lighting customers instead of actually trying to fix their product. Save yourselves the headache. Shop anywhere else.Update 2021/06/09: Laptop is back to spiking to over 100 degrees Celsius and down throttling itself to cool down. This is already after no less than two RMA level repair jobs. Stacked with another family member who is a systems engineer for Disney having mobo overheating issues on their desktop with an ASUS motherboard I'd say the engineering or quality control has really gone downhill. I've confirmed overheating issues with Asus' own software AND with NZXT just to make sure and both report down throttling when the CPU breaks 100 degrees Celsius.

  I waited on a buying a new laptop/notebook until an i7 11th Gen in a 15.6 inch model was available (waiting 2 months even though my current laptop is on its last leg).  This model seems to sell out as soon as they come in stock as it is currently only 1 of a few 15.6 inch models with the i7 11th Gen processor.Of note, the specs on this model state 3 USBs (2 at 2.0 A and 1 at 3.2 A) along with a SD and MSD card reader.  You actually only get the SD card reader slot, but you do get 1 Thunderbolt 4 USB C port as well.  That is a pretty big option to not list.  The HP Pavilion 15 cost $100 more, compares in spec, but does not have the Thunderbolt 4 port.  I am charging my smartphone off of the laptop as we speak using the Thunderbolt 4 port and at full charging speed.  I haven't tested the Thunderbolt 4 to digital display yet.  The USB C on the HP does not provide power and is not as fast as the Thunderbolt 4 port.Of note, this is not a gaming laptop.  The new Iris integrated graphics are stellar for for almost everything you need except for graphics heavy gaming.  But expect to be able to log on in under a second, turn on from a full power down in just a few seconds, connect to wireless devices in mere seconds, and charge very quickly.  Oh, you can let the laptop automatically throttle the CPU or manually switch from Whisper to Balanced to Performance modes via FN+F.As far as the i7 11th Gen processor, this laptop not EVO certified.  At the time of this review, there are no 15.6"" notebooks with an i7 that are rated EVO (BestBuy listed a Dell 15.6"" as EVO, but research showed it was an error on the BestBuy website).  With this unit's current speed, I honestly couldn't imagine an EVO rated laptop being noticeably faster.I prefer 15.6 inch laptops because I need the numeric pad for my activities.  I could go with a 14 inch laptop and then buy a plug in numeric pad, but I don't find that convenient.  One of my older laptops is a Sony Vaio i7 at 17inch.  I found that size cumbersome when traveling with it.  You get the same keyboard on both, but on a 15.6 inch, the non-alpha keys are smaller and grouped more tightly.  That is an acceptable trade off.  Yes you get more screen with a 17"", but if you have a home office, you are most likely working with multiple displays.  For me, I have a dual 22"" monitor set up.  The laptop monitor just becomes a task screen.Cons- A silver keyboard with backlighting can be tough to see the letters/number/symbols in normal day light.  You may want to opt for the Black model with the black keys.  Comparing to the HP Pavilion 15 model, the keys are easier to see, but not by leaps and bounds.  If you are not a hunt and peck typist, this is not show stopper.  If you are, definitely choose the black keyboard model.- This model does not have an RJ45 port for wired network connectivity.  If you have a home office, you know plugging in as opposed to being wireless is typically more stable.  I know that a docking station will easily fix this, but that is besides the point.  This having the latest WiFi 6 is great, but one may need to upgrade their wireless router or Mesh devices to fully see the benefits.I would actually rate this a 4.5 star due to the cons. Amazon doesn't do half stars, so I rounded up.  I was going to round down, but know this will get some 1 star reviews over issues that can easily be resolved, or by reviewers who score it lower because of something trivial.

  Keyboard is poorly lit with some atrocious laser engraving. Very plastic-like feeling without any significant feedback.Screen is not IPS. Everything looks washed out.Bloatware galore. I would suggest fresh install of your favorite OS.One extra star because the color scheme looks easy on the eyes and it has thunderport.I returned it the same day I received it. The pictures on the website is really selling it. If you get a chance to use it at a local store, play with it before ordering it. You'll most likely regret the purchase as soon as you stroke few keys.

  So far so good!! I bought it for photo editing and general use. Processor is fast, and with the 16 gig of memory, it handles multiple open programs with ease!Starts out with Windows 10 Home edition, and besides the Mcafee software (I was able to delete with no problem), it doesnt have much bloatware at all!!!Screen is bright enough (it has the option to turn it down in display settings), and the colors are pretty vivid.Has all the ports I'd expect and more.I do wish the keyboard backlight was a little brighter. The keys are hard to see unless i look directly from above.Have only been using for a day, but so far I'm liking it!!

  No Storage Device present after first start. it was a gift for my goddaughter ,and it was terrible to see her disappointment in her eyes... the package with the laptop was thrown over the fence ,possibly the laptop was damaged during delivery. Nevertheless, the seller was responsible for the package, and he is the one I give feedback to as a frustrated customer.

  Greetings,I purchased this laptop a few months ago. It has the i7 6 core mobile processor(10750H i believe) 2070 maxQ GPU with the 240 Hertz screen. I have built multiple computers and have some decent experience in overclocking, undervolting, and many of Asus's products. I am familiar with their bios. However, I am running into a huge problem with this laptop and I can't figure out what is causing it. I think it has something to do with my undervolt of -60 mlvolts.The Problem:The computer sometimes when i leave it idle and come back. It will have a BSOD. Upon restarting the laptop the fans are off and the clocks are locked at .78ghz. Looking at the fan profiles on Asus Armory Crate it doesn't matter what i set it at. The fans are locked at 0RPM no matter if im on manual, performance, or turbo. I've played with power settings and everything I can. The computer is insanely slow during this time and practically unuseable. My theory is that there was a new BIOS update that completely ruined the fan start up/set sequence during boot. In conjunction with the fan software?Second & third instances: Sometimes I would turn on my computer after a long night of the computer being completely shut down. Same thing happens where processor clocks are locked at .78ghz on task manager and fans are completely off. The solution i found was to restart the computer repeatedly until the fan miraculously comes back on and i get a boost back to 4.3ghz. I think there was one time where I went into the bios and it had reverted my undervolt. Usually from my overclocking and undervolting experience the computer just BSOD's when pushed during Cinebench R20. I will try to keep the computer at stock and see if the problem persists.Update: i can confirm it is the undervolt that is causing it. Its strange because i can benchmark the laptop fine, even at -80mv(the highest voltage you can undervolt it at). I can run cinebench r20 with the undervolt and it will run perfectly fine. Its only when i leave the computer idle afk from the computer for a few hours and come back when i come back with all the fans dead and cpu clocks stuck at .78 ghz. Overall i am going to adjust this review to 3 stars because if you dont care about undervolting then this computer works flawlessly. However, these intel chips are hot and id love to get as much boost and lower temps as possible.When i first purchased the laptop i went ahead and did a bios update prompted by the asus update software.Update: i ended up returning it because it started artifacting and glitching. Also the gaming performance is really disappointing. Id recommend for everyone to wait for the 30 series mobile gpus.

  I'm a hobby gamer and I wanted something spiffy. I chose this one because the RTX 2060S was only a bit less $$$ on the other models I liked so I figured why not go for it. I don't want to have a separate desktop and laptop either so that's what makes this especially worth the money to me.Tl;dr this laptop is butter smooth, well rounded, and a good bang for your buck as far as parts and technical specs. Screen is lacking in shine and feels kind of dull. Triple A games will have your fans running pretty loudly but the CPU keeps a moderate temp in exchange. Feels good to hold. No 10-key.I put my recommendation for the cost to value, however, It's overkill for the games I use it for atm (see below) and I paid extra for the compact design, so if thats you you might be better off going for an RTX 2060 in the Asus TUF or ROG Strix.Expanded review:Pros: It plays Apex, Overwatch, Assassin's Creed Oddessy, and Cyberpunk 2077 all on ultra settings. No hiccups, smooth, good overclock control. Oddessy is a heavy game and it reported and average of 65fps where Overwatch would do around 120fps. I didn't check what Cyberpunk sat fps wise at but it looked to be in the 60 range as well. Where other computers might lag this one just screams it's fans on and keeps preforming. While playing I often had a browser running too and could tab back and forth with no lag and minimal impact to my framerate for having other programs up. I went for this unit for the hardware updates from my previous and I got what I wanted out of that, as well as a slimmer and lighter form factor. I expect this unit to remain technologically relevant for high demand games for a good long time, too. CPU stays cool (70c or so) on most of the mentioned games which is good for it's health. Physically the whole laptop feels sturdy when closed and if you like understated design this nice in that way. Eventually I'll be getting a new monitor to make the most of the power of this unit but tbqh it's dang powerful for its size and portability.Cons include: Wow oh wow can this thing get loud. On higher settings you'll definitely want headphones but with them you're basically set. I was running Cyberpunk on the quiet fan mode as I didn't want to have headphones and it preformed subjectively the same as having it on performance mode, and was appropriately quiet for playing without headphones. Screen leaves a lot to be desired. I may not have my settings down pat yet, I've had the unit for only a couple days, but the lack of streamlining for setup is a major drawback on top of the fact that the screen doesn't feel vivid enough as far as color and shine. Those who are used to things like retina display will find this falling short. Plugged into an external monitor it's hard to beat but that arguably puts the cost for a setup up a few hundred. Insofar as build the screen physically has a lot of flex to it and out of the box brightness disparities in the backlight. The lack of a numpad is a small bummer, as well as the key backlights can only be set to one color or a rotation of a few colors. The build also does not scream ""I'm a $1500 laptop!"". Understated, to say the least, with a completely plastic chassis in this model. Charger is plugged in on the left. Theres only one USB port on the left and the HDMI which might corner me into buying a wireless mouse since the other two USB ports are on the right.

  Awesome for gaming but it gets loud when you play videogames.Battery life is average ( around 4 or 5  hours surfing web or nothing to heavy, while gaming high end games it last around 1 -1:30 hours)The only downside Is that mine comes with the extra slot screw dent so I couldn't upgrade the extra memory, but taking that apart, is an awesome machine.

  Overall this laptop is great and you cant beat its value. The screen is nice and smooth, there aren't any dead pixels and the color is consistent throughout the screen. The keyboard is easy enough to use, the travel is fine for my hands. It does feel squishy (if that makes any sense) if you are used to using a mechanical keyboard. This is a single zone rgb keyboard, it only displays one color at a time. I really wish it was multi zone rgb keyboard so it could have that cool rainbow wave effect. The led lights under the laptop are really cool, they are 5 zone rgb lights and can be customized using Asus's Aura creator. I tried it for a little bit and it would maybe take me a couple of hours to get it the way I want it so i just left it alone. I wish they had a preset effect where the bottom rgb lights would have that wave effect. The laptop is very fast and smooth to use. There isn't a usb c port, which i wish it had. There isn't a webcam either, but I dont usually use one anyway. The weight is okay for a 17inch laptop, I have in one place and barely move it around so not a big deal for me. The biggest con to this laptop is the battery life, it lasts me less than 3 hours. But If you're looking for a laptop with high specs and are able to play games with that doesn't break the bank, this is a good option.

  I'm not a gamer, I bought this because it has a huge screen, good for my advertising work.  The app that comes with it to control the pulsing back-lit keyboard sure comes in handy -- I turned off the pulsing colors and made all 4 color zones white, voila, kicking work computer!  It makes cool start up sounds (gamer stuff), so when I start working on this laptop, it's an exciting start!  It's thick and heavy, not a super portable work laptop, I use it to do work at home, the screen is huge, so I can see spreadsheets etc with ease.  Laptop is SMOKING FAST!  I am very HAPPY with my purchase!

  Before I changed to this Laptop, I was using a HP Core i5 with 12Gb RAM and 128 GB SSD, and works faster than this, it's a shame because I was waiting for a better perfomance, first 2 days even the Google Chrome goes to black screen with any reason. Only I felt a better experience whit video renderizing, but nothing else. By the way, Asus it's not providing technical support now and I couldn't register the product also beause the web site doesn't works properly, it's a shame from this brand

  Have had this laptop for about three months now and so far so good. I don't love the screen since it is an LCD as opposed to LED and not as vibrant as my past laptop. I have played around with the settings and the white doesn't look as white as I would prefer (has a yellow tint to it) but other than that it is AMAZING. Works incredibly fast and smooth. Also, keep in mind that it doesn't have built-in webcam if you're looking for that.

  Well, the laptop is visually beautiful, the materials feel and look great, the sound is not amazing but its pretty good, some people complaint about the keyboard but actually I really liked it (except the arrow keys), the screen was something that surprised me because the black depth is really good. So that would be 5 stars no doubt. My complaints are: 1. I know its not a gamming laptop, not even close, but it has problems with light games, sure this is not importante for the mayority of users for this kind of product and I'm fine with that, just think is important to share that experience, even with Asphalt 9 some times it lags.My mayor complaint is the 42Wh 3-cell lithium-polymer battery, I do not understand how in 2020 there are laptops with 4 hours of battery life, yesterday using chrome, firefox and spotify it lasted 3:40 hrs. For this kind of products that the end user needs to be on the move I think they should pay more attention to this feature.Finally... screenpad is really cool but not that useful, is a feature mostly to show off with friends but c'mon.. its a smartphone screen on the laptop hahaha. Hope this review is useful and sorry if my english has problems but its not my native language.

  The product is good, easy to carry, and nice build materials, only one problem, There is only one slot for ram which was only 4GB that lead me to find out that the other 4GB ram is used via M.2.my second point is about storage, if u want to add more storage buy a M.2 ssd, because there is no space to put a normal ssd inside the laptop. ONLY M.2 space (marked with red rectangle)overall, nice product, a bit overpriced.

  Nice piece of equipment here.  Good for a starting gamer but I purchased for business.  I'm an older lady and the touchpad frustrates me.  To be the default mouse should be the main screen not the pad but I'm sure my thought process is faulty.  I purchased a wireless mouse and that took care of it.  It just isn't something I'm used to yet but carries a nice range of extras.  It comes basic since everything seems to be in the ""clouds"" these days.  Don't like that either but we boomers tend to be critical that way....privacy and all, you know.  It IS a nice little system and I don't believe you'd be disappointed.

  This is a solid laptop, but mine seemed to have issues with the pen support.  When writing a sentence with the Asus pen or Bamboo Ink, it would occasionally miss one of the lines I would write, meaning it would miss a letter or part of a letter.  Since I tried two different pens, it seemed to be an issue with the digitizer itself in the screen.  Since I need to use this laptop for handwriting, I had to return it.Otherwise the computer is great, if you either don't need to pen functionality or yours doesn't have the same issues mine had, it is a solid computer.  Screen was very colorful, it has a very fast 8th gen U series i7, big battery, very thin and light. The most impressive thing to me were the speakers.  Wow, best sounding laptop speakers I have ever heard.  I genuinely think this is a great machine if you aren't too worried about the pen very much... Unfortunately that is a very important component to me.  Since the other review on Amazon also mentioned pen issues, I decided I'm going to go to a new product.

  Had this for a month. Great value at $850, very thin, but well made. I have the i5-8250U model and it's very fast indeed, it would be the minority who would need the power of the i7 model. Much cheaper than the HP or Lenovo ""equivalents"". Quiet in operation, can't even really hear the fan even when it does spin up.Get the CableMatters USB-C to 3xUSB3 + gigabit ethernet adapter for $20 if you need ethernet connectivity when at home or office. Otherwise the WiFi adapter in this model is very fast. I get speeds upwards of 200Mbit/sec (25MB/sec) copying a large file across my network. I got a bluetooth mouse as well so that I wouldn't have to spoil the edge of the laptop with a bump out from even a micro-USB receiver from that kind of mouse.Others have complained about the fingerprint reader, I haven't had an issue with it at all, very fast and no issues reading my prints. The touchpad is very smooth and responsive. If multiple users have their fingerprints registered, you don't have to click on the user's name before scanning finger, just put anyone's finger on the reader and it will match it with that person's login and you will see the desktop in less than a couple of seconds. More of a ""Windows 10 Hello"" feature than a feature of this specific laptop, but I thought it was worth mentioning.For a while I have wanted a keyboard that is backlit and this one is good and gives you three levels of brightness.One thing you MUST do is get the SSD version. I don't know why anyone would build a really nice spec machine like this and cripple it with a slow spinny hard drive. Get the SSD version and you will not be disappointed.Battery life is good, it will go for 6-8 hours with the screen at medium brightness and performing non CPU-intensive tasks, just browsing and MS-Office won't tax this thing at all.

  I bought the UA version since I'm not using any heavy computing software, I just needed a slim, good battery life, easy to pack 2 in 1 with pen support for med school. The laptop looks and feels nice...I would prefer an actual aluminum finish over the grey metallic one present, but otherwise, it is nice looking and definitely slim and light. The battery lasts a long time, I haven't actually measured it, but I fully charged it, unplugged it, and it has been going strong for hours and I'm still only at ~60%. My biggest problem is the pen/stylus functionality...the pen is quite nice, especially considering it is included in the price...but unfortunately it doesn't work very well with the laptop. It doesn't recognize the first few strokes of the pen, at best, it will recognize the first half of a stroke (which is actually worse than not recognizing it at all since I then have to erase the errant stroke and start again rather than just repeat the stroke; ie half a D is worse than no D at all). I wasted about an hour with Asus customer service to see if they had a solution, but all they suggested was a factory reset (it's brand new...seemed pointless) and optimizing the BIOS, neither of which helped. Since I bought it mainly for note-taking with the pen, it will have to go back.

  My laptop looks so sleek and chic. Very portable easy to flip for comfortability. I realize that sometimes the touch screen function can be annoying when you want to touch the screen without doing anything, but i think there are settings to change that while you work in laptop mode.

Have been using it almost daily for University and my job as a photographer (due screen quality of colors - They are pretty good tho, nice balance and accuracy) , have been carrying it upside down, from here to there, in my backpack with my bunch of books and no problems. Maybe on the outside, one or two scratches in the aluminum body, but nothing to worry about.Sincerely not used to stand the computer in the tent mode or even the tablet mode except for when I'm chilling watching a movie or something like that. It's a pretty solid computer, I hope it's durable too.Battery life maybe it's not as good as expected, but with one full charge it will last a full day with intermittent usage, maybe 6-7 hrs of continuous use.I love it! Haven't had any problems with upgrades. No dead pixels in the screen at this time. Not frozen, not even once.Now, when it comes to overheating, I can say it gets warm when over throttling, I was rendering a video, pretty good performance tho: (60fps - 1080p - almost 15 mins of duration in only 30 mins using Sony Vegas, but it did got a lot warmer.

  I purchased this computes after replacing a hard drive and on/off switch in a Dell.  I have had the Asus computer for about 2 months and use it multiple hours per day.  Very pleased with the computer.  The key pad adequately spaced.  The battery life is excellent.  The quality seems much better than the Dell.  The Dell Inspriron battery heat was a problem when actually having the computer in lap.  Asus does not seem to have this problem.  Long term Dell customer that has converted to Asus.

  Today I got the replaced laptop for the 2nd time, however, it turned out as defective as the other 2.The problem with the first one is that one side of the RGB lightbar stopped working after a week of use, accompanying noisy electric buzzing sound when I move the mouse (NO MATTER USE EXTERNAL MOUSE OR TRACKPAD). A week after that, I got the replaced one. However, it came in with an open box  (Seal was broken), then I became really suspicious about it and ran several tests, only to find that the screen was defective. Except for the IPS glow that is common for the IPS panel, there were BACKLIGHT BLEEDS. Then, I requested the replacement with a fluke mind. In the end, I got the 3rd one, which was nothing but a copy of the 2nd one (Pre-opened Box and Light bleed screen).When I contact ASUS customer service, they always told me to dive into some software settings (DEVICE MANAGEMENT,  even BIOS) as if I can fix the defective screen through system settings.With that being said, I'm reluctant to draw a conclusion, hope you don't encounter this kind of issue when you consider this laptop.

Un aspecto a tener en cuenta es que este modelo no tiene c√°mara, por lo cual para conferencias se debe comprar una c√°mara aparte.

  The computer is excellent!! However the USB sockets on the left side are a bit too close to the bottom plate so that it's hard to get a USB cable to plug in with th PC on a flat (non-elevated ) surface.Addendum: The writing for the instruction book is incredibly tiny, I needed glasses AND a magni fying glass to read the writing. I have 20/20 vision with glassses. ASUS needs to make the writing more legible as not everyone is blessed with better than 20/20 vision.

  Overall very happy. Fantastic laptop as robust and powerful as my desktop once I upgraded. I maxed out the ram and added two additional Samsung 980 SSDs.  ""Yes but can it run Cyberpunk"". Ha. I have not attempted to use ray tracing but yes, fully maxed out setting on Cyberpunk without a hitch. My ONLY complaints about the laptop are 1.  it is LOUD (fans). When it is gaming the fans ramp up to max speed and wow are they loud. My desktop and previous laptop were whisper quiet even under full load but this... Wow. Jet engine loud. And 2. The speakers are actually pretty crappy. Even at 100% it is difficult to hear. My last laptop was superb speaker wise so I had high expectations there.  Oh, and not a complaint but if you are gaming make sure you do have it plugged in. It doesn't perform very well not plugged in when gaming.... But I expected that, my last laptop was the same.  Not an issue.

  This is a great gaming Laptop and value.  The look, feel and hardware are all impressive. There is not much bloatware installed upon arrival.  The fan is a bit loud as with any gaming laptop and I suggest you also get a good cooling pad/stand.

  Finally received this laptop after one wrong item. The first impression was the built quality and aesthetic looks of the PC. I had a big disappointment when I heard the speakers and weird sounds they make but after 5-10 mins they turn to normal and now they are fair for me.PROS:- Built quality- Very high performance- Budget-friendly compared to other RTX laptops- Portability- Thermals (Didn't notice thermal throttling while playing games for a couple hours)Cons:- AMAZON, IT IS NOT RTX 2070 IT IS RTX 2070 MAX-Q- Fan noise (understandably)- Touchpad, you can't find it cool after using a MacBook right?

  ¬†The ROG Zephyrus M Thin and Portable Gaming Laptop by ASUS is my first 100% gaming laptop and while I'll admit to being blown away by this machine, this doesn't mean I won't note a few issues about it. First, regarding its speed ‚Äì it's incredibly fast booting up and in shutting down even when Windows 10 wants to install updates during reboots. I have never had a machine handles updates more quickly. While downloading some Steam Valve games over WI-Fi, for instance, I noted speeds that were close to what I've gotten over a hard-wired Ethernet connection. The speed of games I play reached 65 mbps, nearly twice the 35 mbps I got with them on every other computer I've tried. I had it connected at 5Ghz to obtain these speeds, I didn`t bother with 2.4Ghz because I have too many other streaming devices latched onto that signal of my router already.When it comes to installing software and/or loading programs and multi-tasking the Zeph M is very smooth and responsive, switching between applications seamlessly. The i7-9750h makes this possible with its Hexacore processing and speeds from 2.6-4.5Ghz. This capability is doubtlessly due to the 16 gigs of ddr4 ram and the Ge-force RTX 2070 graphics with Max-Q design. The card had 8 gigs of its own ram (DDR6), enabling me to set my games' resolution with a 240Hz 3ms refresh rate: sharp, detailed and the smoothest that I've ever seen my Resident Evil 5 run. This computer also has the strongest onboard graphics Intel 630 to switch to if you want to consume less power but still play games without much loss in quality.There is a 1TB SSD inside that syncs nicely with the above mentioned speed and seamlessness, with rapid boot times and shut downs. The audio is incredible with a surreal 3-D feel about it, though this effect is evident only in a very quiet room. A minor short-coming with this audio, however, is that the maximum volume on stock apps (and on Windows 10 master volume controls) is not very loud against constant background noise. If that requirement is met, it`s like a mini theater in your lap.There are a few cons that need mention: It comes with an average amount of bloat, and some of its more personalized software was a disappointment due to the fact that many were free trials, something that I didn't catch until after I'd installed them. This makes such programs seem more like additional bloatware to me. Also, this laptop does not come with a camera; the pre-installed Skype program is aggressive enough to remind you that you either need install a camera or uninstall Skype. There is no SD card slot. Many devices really on them these days and they are very fairly standard even in relatively inexpensive machines. Nor is there a CD/DVD reader/writer either, though this is less surprising given that such devices can been seen as dated tech by now. I suspect that this particular omission may also have been taken to keep this laptop as thin and sleek as it is. By way of compensation, there are three standard USB and one USB-C ports. Ethernet, headphone, HDMI, and a mic ports make up the rest of the inputs.The system does consume large amounts of energy so the battery comes off a little disappointing. Even while it was plugged in it would only max out at 96 percent charge, at which I was worried it was defective but after shutting it down and charging it would reach 100%. It can also become very hot and the internal fan is rather noisy. A few tweaks will alleviate some of these issues and the software that comes with it can help you customize different profiles for this.Now the best part for me that grabbed my attention was the design. It's thin 15.6 inch perfection in a titanium brushed lid and a very nice illuminated red logo. The keys are large, flat and smooth, very quiet to the touch. The keyboard comes with an Aura feature, which illuminates the keys in a rainbow of color, pattern, pulses, etc. All the keys are well lit and easy to understand when it comes to media keys and icons for specialized keys. You can customize your very own light show on your keyboard. There is no number keypad, but who cares ? It's pretty enough to forgive that. These features sacrifice battery power so I'd suggest employing them only while the machine is connected to its power supply. I must say that this is a very impressive system and if you can afford it, I'd say go for it ... you will not be disappointed by its performance.

  ¬†When I received I was amazed how slim and thin, light weight the lap top was.Here‚Äôs some Pros and Cons about this laptop below,** Pros ** - Excellent screen quality: 240hz is great for a laptop- The keyboard is solid with next to no flex- Sound is amazing for how slim the laptop is: Laptop is very lightweight and slim for the hardware its packing- Fans do get loud in turbo but they do not detract from gaming** Cons **- Minor bloatware on the systemUpdate:  Bloatware is super annoying- Asus software is buggy- Wish the screen was biggerI would want to give 4.5 out of 5 star because of the Bloatware and the Asus software. Overall, this Laptop is still worth getting for how light weight, slim it is. Also, the screen quality is phenomenal when you play games with the Laptop. I would recommend this Great quality Laptop

Seriously, please stop wasting people's time and do not send anything until it is 100% solid. If we are spending almost 2k on a laptop, it must be rock solid, period. I will wait for the replacement and update my review. Update : after more than 2 weeks and several phone calls, still waiting for a refund.

  Ordered this and one of the fan bearings was bad. It was loud at idle and actually kinda shook the laptop a little bit. Talked to asus customer support to confirm and once they did i returned it. Got a second one of these and the fans were fine this time, but the second one had overheating and frame rate issues. I think they forgot to thermal paste the cpu. It was overheating and even old games like Diablo 3 weren't even coming close to max frame rate. Pretty sure the laptop was tanking frames to lower heat levels, but at times it would crash anyways. Had to return the second one too. Grateful amazon has a good return policy. Not buying asus products in the future.

  Likes:+ Great Screen+ LONG battery life+ Can warm up your house if you cant afford heatCons:- CPU temp immediatley goes to 80 degrees celsius while gaming even while I have it sitting on a laptop cooler.- Nvidia software caps FPS at 30 by default for some reason, which was annoying to figure out- Gets so hot (when its not connected to third party cooling station) that it shuts off after only a few minutes.

  I don't have any major complaints about the laptop. It runs well so far and looks great. Just be aware that if you are expecting a backlit keyboard, it's not on this version of the 510. The Asus page for this model doesn't advertise this difference, and it's a little disappointing since the Amazon product picture clearly shows the keyboard having the ability to control the keyboard brightness with the icons printed on the f3 and f4 keys. My laptop came with no such icons on those keys.

  So far the new laptop has been good. As other‚Äôs mentioned super fast start and closing due to the SST processor. I am having issues with the monitor as it just seems blurry to me.

  For this price point, this is the best laptop I've ever owned ... and that includes Macs, HPs and Dells. I had a budget to adhere to and somehow found this ASUS laptop.

  I recently decided to replace my four year old desktop system with a laptop.Given that this was going to be my main computer, I needed a machine that had a good amount of grunt for video conversion and other processor intensive tasks. This machine has the new Haswell i7-4700HQ processor, which has impressive performance with relatively good power consumption.I am an occasional but enthusiastic gamer, so I needed reasonably good graphics - enough to run Civ V, Simcity, Skyrim and whatever is released next at mid settings. Obviously GPU is always a trade off between price, performance and power consumption, but I think the GT750M strikes a reasonable balance between the three. You will have to make your own call, though. If you want more performance, look at the¬†

  I read all the reviews here before buying this computer.  This is all the upgrades I did to make it the best computer I ever had.1.) Network Card - the ASUS one gave me only 3 bars in the room of the house that I enjoy.  My work laptop (Leveno X220) was much better. This ( Intel 7260HMW IEEE 802.11ac Mini PCI Express Bluetooth 4.0 - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Combo Adapter ) card fixed things... though like others write, the bluetooth doesn't work.  I am still downloading drivers trying to fix it.  If anyone comes up with a solution, let me know. Cost: $30Installing the card is easy - pop the cover - search around for a similar card and replace it.  It is in plain view with two wires connecting the card.2.) Upgrade the memory to 16M.  I do photo stitching which takes up tons of memory... and I used (Kingston Technology HyperX Plug n Play 16 GB Kit (2x8 GB) 1600MHz DDR3 PC3-12800 Non-ECC CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Notebook Memory KHX16LS9P1K2/16) memory.  Installing was also easy if you are careful.  Anyone need 8 gigs of memory? Cost: $1753) Replace the slow hard drive with a SSD - mine is (Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Single Unit Version Internal Solid State Drive MZ-7TE250BW) Cost: $150  This by far is the best upgrade for speed!  The drive comes with software (good software that is easy to use) to migrate your OS from the slow hard drive to the SSD - and very nice directions.  (I like Samsung so much I was tempted to buy their computer - but I like ASUS.)4.) Get a caddy to replace the cd-rom.  Anyone need a cd rom?  Cost:  $12  (NEW SATA 2nd HDD caddy for 9.5mm Universal CD/DVD-ROM ACER BENQ HP DELL ASUS)  You will need to take the bezel off the cd-rom and pop it on your caddy so your ASUS  keeps the case looking like it has a CD.  You can see a multitude of videos on putting the caddy & HDD into your computer... it is easy.  Be sure to completely put it all in or the HDD will not work... i.e. all the screws straps and such.5.) You need a set of tools to take the back off.  Cost: $7 (Tool Repair Kit Precision Screw Driver Set Torx + Flat Head + Safe Plying Prying Pry Tool for Motorola Verizon Sprint ATT Cingular Razor and More)  It was a quality kit - but  I marked my 5 size with a sharpie because they all look a like to me... unless you have good eyes to see the sizes stamped on the shank of the drivers.6.) Last, I got a case or the thing because it's cheap and stuff in my backpack gets messed up easily.  This case fits like a glove and is very nice. (AmazonBasics 15 to 15.6-inch Laptop Sleeve) Cost: $12.What do I like about the laptop that makes it the best laptop ever?* The keyboard is so nice, I will not buy a wireless keyboard for it as I do all my laptops.  (I like the feel)* The display is crisp and beautiful.  The crispness is enough that I am not saying, ""Awe!  It's so damn small!!""* The speakers are good enough for listening to music - kind of like a mid-range cheap radio.  Clear but you are no going to crank it up and have a dance party.  I like them.* It is super fast on boot - processing - internet.* USB3.0 is very nice!* I hardly use the touch screen.Downside?* It's big and heavy... but I'm not taking it backpacking and I'm not the type that hangs out in public places with my computer.*The bluetooth isn't working because of that damn Intel card* Windows 8.1 is annoying - but I'm learning to get around the things that annoy me ( the ""charms"" and Microsoft trying to force you to use their products)  I think complaints against Windows 8 is over-rated and from people too lazy to figure out how to navigate around the ""training wheels"" and marketing efforts of Microsoft.

  Amazing laptop. Thank god I chose this pc over dell xps 13. I see lot of people complaining about trackpad on 14 inch model but it is pefect on this model. If you are looking for portable, fast performance, and great specs. This is for you.

  I was extremely unhappy with speed of a laptop that I purchased a year ago from Dell that was $1,000+  I  asked my son to find me a computer that was fast and I could have a lot of tabs open at once. He researched and we ordered this one. I LOVE IT!!!! FAST, light weight and quiet! Its perfect for when I need to be on the road or in a meeting.

  This laptop is the size of a legal pad!  As soon as you get it started and connected to the internet, carve out 30-45 minutes for updates.  After that, you'll love it!A SSD is mandatory for me.  My career requires me to multitask on a lot of applications.  A good graphics card is also mandatory.I bought this on Prime Day fo $850 and earned 6% back  on my Amazon Card.  However the everyday price is still cheaper then the yellow box store.This computer is quick.  I wanted a Mac Air but missed out on the Prime Day sale for it. This PC Laptop is close enough.

  I purchased this Zenbook to upgrade from my Asus Vivobook E200HA. The Zen will be used as my work computer in my home office. I haven't started to work from home yet so I can't comment on how it handles work tasks. So far it has been a great little laptop while doing typical web browsing, word processing. I installed bluestacks to see if it could handle some light gaming of my favorite cell phone games and it did well. However battery life is seriously compromised when doing so and it heat up quickly, the fans stayed on. In Zens defense, this is not a gaming laptop, and I am by no means a gamer. I just wanted to see if it was capable.I'm seeing 7-10 hours of battery life on average. Nothing close to the 14hrs that are advertised. The trackpad is slick and responsive. Way more to than the Vivo.The one thing I don't like is the right side shift key is super small. I end up hiting the enter key by accident. It's not a huge deal breaker to tick off a star, but annoying.Will update once the Zen gets some work hours under its belt. For now I am happy with this Prime Day purchase.Update 8/17/2019A couple or weeks of work under it's belt and the Zen performs well. Unfortunately, the small shift key and overall squished feeling keyboard led me to return it. I was constantly hitting the enter key in error and the arrow keys lost all functionality for me being crammed where they were.I went though two Zenbook 14"". The first was purchased through a 3rd party and was obviously an open box or refurb, despite not making that clear in their ad. Fingerprints all over the top of the case and it was missing the Ethernet adapter. I got the black screen of death while trying to update windows 10. I had it less than 8 hours and back into the box it went and returned. Pictures I added to this review are of the returned 14"" side by side with the 13"".I then purchased the Zen 14"" with screenpad and better graphics card....typing on it now...made sure not to purchase from 3rd party.  Third time is a charm ! It came brand new, no fingerprints with all accessories. It may only be nominally bigger but it's a world of difference to me. Difference in cost was $322.06. May not be worth it to some but it was to me. I am completely happy with my Zen 14. Don't think I'll really use the screenpad function but it looks cool.You won't be disappointed in the performance of the Zenbooks. I'm keeping my review at five stars as the laptop performed as it is supposed to. I was not able to get used to the keyboard.

  Nice bright and colorful display, even better then my 15.6"" gamer that weighs in and 7.3lb. This is even better at 2.7lb, checked on my digital kitchen scale. Fast, bright, cool, what else is there. I like the 3D IR camera, don't even have to log in. Looks very well made, wish had more USB, but has full size HDMI, not mini like many ultra-lights have. Have already run for about 7hrs on 1st charge, getting low, but still running.Wish I could give it 6 stars.

  The specs of this laptop were good and it has a good battery. It is incredibly small--in an odd rectangular shape, resulting in its uncomfortable keyboard layout because the keys are smashed together to accomplish this small size. It's cool that a num pad is built into the track pad, but even just the few seconds to turn on the num pad is enough for you to ignore it to just reach for the number keys instead. Also the track pad is too smooth imo, resulting in sliding across further than intended. The screen/resolution looked just a little odd to me. The screen would sometimes flicker in a way that was concerning, I was thinking something was wrong with it. Mine came with a very bad trackpad (the button part of it)--every 1/8 presses on the right button (representing a right click) would be registered as a left click or not at all! This was so frustrating, resulting in opening apps I didn't intend to. This bad trackpad is unacceptable for everyday use, so it really doesn't matter if everything else is great if the trackpad sucks, hence my bad review.

  Really enjoying the ASUS Zen book 13.  The facial recognition is a nice touch for a fast and smooth sign in.  The computer is very sleek and does everything I need it to do for work.  It is also incredibly sturdy for such a light weight device.  I have had issues with my former laptop overheating so I appreciate that this computer was designed to provide some lift to help with airflow and to prevent it from overheating.  Overall it is a great computer for those who are on the move and need to be able to work from anywhere.

  Disappointing laptop. Poorly designed. Cheap feeling keyboard. The backlights for the keys arent even large enough to properly light up many of the keys. No webcam (that wasn't a feature in 2021 that I ever expected I needed to check for). Horrible housing design. You have to take the entire bottom of the laptop off with about a dozen varying sized screws to access ram or hard drive slots. They also added ribbon cables to the bottom of the case that need unhooked before you can remove the bottom. The speakers are atrocious. Full volume is similar to very low volume (maybe 15 of 100%) on my other laptop. This is a huge negative if you enjoy youtube or community created content where recording levels are often less than ideal. Way too many idiotic features to list. Very disappointed in the purchase. I expected better from an ASUS laptop at this price point. Not even remotely the quality you can get with many laptops much lower in cost than this one.  Total trash. I would recommend finding a better model and probably even better yet another manufacturer. This is the last ASUS I will ever buy.

  The audio jack stopped working. I only purchased this laptop 3-4 moths ago. To make a long story short, Asus support had me do everything from reinstalling drivers to factory resetting the laptop and nothing worked. The only option they gave me is to send it in for a minimum of 2 weeks plus shipping. Not really an option as I use this for school and work as well. So I'm stuck with a broken laptop and there is nothing I can do about it as Asus has exactly ZERO authorized repair centers. I cant even return it at this point.As far as performance goes, the laptop's thermals are straight garbage and throttles under moderate load. Dont get baited by the specs

  Wow. Where do I begin? Everything was great for a month, until the motherboard crashed (would no longer charge or turn on) and I had to do an RMA. After buying nothing but Asus where PC and components are concerned for 14 years, I will never purchase again. If you're even considering buying an Asus product, PLEASE do yourself a favor and read the following.1 month into ownership as stated above, motherboard crashed. The laptop is used entirely at a desk, not moved around, not eaten around, and of course no drinks nearby, just to establish the fact that it's used less than intended, so this alone is a bad sign.This laptop was purchased (as seen on this page) with 2TB in RAID 0, one of the primary reasons I purchased it, speed and not having 2 separate 1 TB drives. This is important.3 weeks after RMA, I got it back. FedEx delivered it in box that was 3/4ths of the way untaped. Bizarre. But hey, I got it back. Turn it on, and one of the FIRST things I notice, is that Windows is no longer activated. Not great but ok...Next, I find that the MyAsus app keeps shutting down. And then I can't install Adobe creative cloud as it keeps encountering an error. Now, I can't install even Google Chrome, same issue. Wtf.Here's where it becomes a true nightmare. I pull up My PC. No longer do I have a single 2tb drive. I now have 2 TB, partitioned into 3 drives. 2 physical m.2 drives... partitioned into 3 drives.45 minutes of hold later, I'm on the phone with the RMA center. First thing I mentioned is the Raid not existing and being 3 drives. And what do they tell me? ""None of our laptops have Raid."" So I send them a link to this laptop ON THE ASUS website, where of course ALL of the Strix notebooks are Raid 0. They then backpedal, and tell me MY notebook didn't have Raid 0. They then try and convince me it originally had 3 hard drives. Which is why the repairs ended up with me having 3 drives. Which of course was not the case, they just partitioned one of the hard drives to make it LOOK like I had 3 hard drives.Next I spoke with a manager, who for 2 hours argued that my Notebook was not sold with 2TB in Raid 0. They said I must have purchased from a reseller on Amazon who created the Raid. I explained it was purchased directly from the Asus Store on Amazon, which they then told me didn't exist. They kept telling me my serial number was not one that had Raid0, that instead it came with 3 different hard drives. Finally, I explained I have the original box, which shows my serial number, shows 1tb+1tb SSD in Raid 0, AND the shipping label...is directly from Asus in CA. This finally got them to escalate my case. So instead of issuing another RMA to fix the litany of issues created by the 1st RMA, I now have a nearly $3k paperweight, and I have to wait 3 days to even hear back.TL;DR- this laptop from Asus directly came back to me completely unusable. Can't install ANY apps, Asus pre-installed apps force close, doesn't have Raid 0, and they insisted there are 3 hard drives, when in fact they just partitioned one hard drive into 2 sections so that it looks like 3 hard drives.To make it worse, while this was in RMA, I bought the 17 inch, which set me back $3400. I'm returning it of course, and will go spend my money at MSI or Aorus.So from a 14 year avid supporter of Asus products, I can't stress enough, DO NOT BUY ASUS. They have changed dramatically the last 3 years and with a high likelihood of failure, their warranty means nothing as the RMAed product is much worse than the original. I wish I would have seen something like this prior to purchase, so hopefully it saves someone else.

  TLDR: This laptop is such an amazing product, thermals are fine with high end games and the keyboard isn't hot!! such raw power in small laptop compare to bulky ones from MSI or Alienware aream51.I had an Asus ROG Zephyrus M and I tested my friends laptops (Lenovo Legion 2019 and Alienware m15 R2), these 3 laptops are good but the thermal aren't great making it impossible to play for hours at max ""power"" of the laptop, also the keyboard is really hot while playing.With my last ROG I had to undervolted it a lot to stop thermal throttle when playing games like APEX/COD Warzone (high end games).I was losing hope on high end gaming laptops, specially with RTX since I tested an Asus laptop with a GTX 1660 ant thermal are way better.Then this laptop got on sale and I like a lot Asus ROG so I decided to sell my Zephyrus and try this out.I can play games like CSGO/Valorant with CPU/GPU thermals about 68-72 degree Celsius and games like APEX/COD Warzone at 77-79 (sometimes it goes to 80 for a bit) degree Celsius. That's freaking amazing!!!!!The FPS in every game is about 110 to a bit less than 300 with everything in very high/ultra and all enabled.

  I've had for only 24 hours. Today it wouldn't turn on. I kept hitting power, and pressing keys and mouse. Nothing. It was plugged in and had one light on indicating it had power. Then I pressed and held the power button for a long time, forcing a hard power off. After that, it turned on. So it was obviously hung up.  Another thing is, the owners manual says you should unplug it when it's turned off. How many people are gonna do that? Do people unplug their tv's when they're turned off. That's stupid!Had it 10 days now. Fixed the update bios problem. I just started installing  fs 2200, which is what I bought it for. It's  very hot now, almost too hot to touch under the display. My ambient temperature  is close to the 95f which is the maximum your'e  supposed to operate it at.  Boots to windows in 10 seconds. I ran a couple of games. It runs prepare 3d at a high frame rate. The fan noise isn't  that bad, because here in the Philippines,  you need to run a fan to cool yourself down anyway.

  Over the years I have owned nearly a dozen laptops. Virgin to laptops, I am not. lolIf you find this review useful, please mark it helpful!I will start by saying I am very happy with the build and materials here! The metal used here is SOLID! No flimsy aluminum like the Macbooks tend to use. No rubber, plastic rubbish like Dell tries to get by with. The metal is very rigid and strong. I had an MSI before and it got dinged by a slight-hit in the front. I describe its metal as hollow. I would say the material here is as solid as what they use for the Surface Books.I especially like how solid the back of screen-lid is. The inner-area of the screen (the screen itself) is plasticky but I'm definitely not too worried about something happening to my screen while I have it in my backpack.The keyboard-area is very nice, fingerprint-resistant and will have you looking very-good when you pull it out at a meetup. All the design-elements are very classy and impressive.Of course, one of the #1 reasons I was adamantly set on getting this laptop or something like it was because I really wanted as 4k-display because I do use alot of Adobe tools. I wanted something that could provide me with a lot of screen real-estate on the go! I also know how important AdobeRGB is going to be for video production going-forward and the screen here definitely does not disappoint! It's brightness and vibrance has a way of making the screen feel even bigger than it actually is. My screen has no flaws or issues whatsoever! Extremely pleased to have it!The specs of course are amazing. I'd be hard-pressed to strain this fast 32GB of ram. It's just great! If you want to get the full-speed out of it, go to the provided ProArt app by Asus and switch it to Rendering mode. When the fans kick up to their full-rate you will definitely hear them rev up!Ports are also a big-deal for me and I am fairly satisfied with the ports here. A full-size SD-card slot and USB-C charging would have been nice but overall I have more than enough ports and options.The speakers here are also surprisingly good! Capable of some very deep, rich and heavy-bass and pretty well-balanced!The battery-life has also been good for a system with a dedicated-GPU pushing a 4k screen at all times.Here are some of the quirks with it that you won't know about unless you actually have one in front of you: 1) The weight-distribution is back-heavy, so when you pick it up you should definitely grab it from the back. This has been making me feel like I have to be a little careful with how I carry and pick it up. 2) The trackpad works very-well but in 2020, it would be nice if they offered something a little wider like HP and MSI often include to better-match the aspect-ratio of the screen. 3) The keys on the keyboard are well-spaced and arranged but they could stand to be offer a little more give. Maybe just a little-bit more squishy. 4) Some people would take issue with it not having the webcam but personally I could careless! The webcams thrown into most laptops are usually crap anyway! I cover them up right away for the privacy-assurance. If you need to do video-conferencing, get a real-webcam like a C920 and plug it in when you need it!Overall, I'm very happy to have this baby! I have had many laptops I was never compelled to write a review for but I did write one for this which suggest that I must have some strong-feelings about having it!There are a lot of things you buy these days that just feel like generic, throwaway items you use just to get-by with. This laptop doesn't feel like that for me. Its not perfect but I will say that it is a very-good product that I intend to keep for as long as it decides to stay with me! The specs, the performance and build-quality are definitely a win and a great value for the money! :-)

  My largest purchase on Amazon, and one I regret. If Possibly, I would return ( I have about 3 days left in the window ) Unfortantly, it's been at the Asus Service repair place for the past 47 and counting. I would not recommend, and I will never purchase this brand again. I already had problems with them not supplying me with the free 3 months worth of adobe cloud, but then with in 2 weeks of on and off usage I got the blue screen of death. Figured, it's brand new, I'm under the warrenty it would be quicker to just get it fixed and back before Christmas so I could use for work. They ended up needing to replace hard drive after I called for another update ( on the 47th day ) they informed me they ran into another issue with the battery. Something they don't typically see until year 3 or 4 of heavy usage. I was told when they ran the battery test ( typically takes 20mins ) they couldn't even complete it before it failed. It was draining that quick. So now, they are having to order a new battery.I'm now expecting to be with out this a good 60+ days at this rate. This was bought for work!!!!!! This is absolutely the worst experience and will not do it again and I seriously advise you to look else where. The trouble this has caused for my business is unreal.... I honestly should get my money back. This is an issue on there end, that I am having to deal with on mine.If 0 Stars were possible I would; should be compensated - it's the right thing.

  From opening the box to opening the laptop. Really nice quality build. Super fast. Runs Adobe Creative Suite really well. I choose this over the MacBook Pro and I don‚Äôt regret it at all. More memory and the same processing. After a few weeks of use.  Well bad news. For some reason the computer with heavy use with photoshop kept randomly shutting down completely. Goes dark and reboots sometimes. I thought maybe software. Reinstalled and kept doing this. Decided to return.

  We bought this laptop to rent out to students at a university computer lab.  It happens to have better specs than our regular lab desktops, which is saying a lot.  According to our testing, this laptop handles the GPU and CPU bound tasks very well, handling CAD programs like SolidWorks without issue.  There are a couple of drawbacks though.  The trackpad was noted as being too sensetive, often being activated by the users palm while typing, and the unit has no webcam.  Ultimately, we decided to return this laptop in favor of a different model, (mostly because of the webcam) but that's mostly our fault for not checking before purchase.  Otherwise, I would be happy to own this machine personally.

  I was really excited to get this laptop! It was amazing, at first. I had this laptop for TWO weeks before the problems started. My keyboard completely stopped working (I have to mentioned, the laptop did not fall, or get damaged in any way). I treated this laptop like a fragile little baby, seeing as how expensive it was. So I after trying every fix I could find, I had to send it in for repairs. And now repairs has my laptop longer than I had the privelege of having it. Turns out the keyboard needs replacing. I don't know if I received a bad product or what exactly happened. But I'm hoping to give a better review when I get my laptop back, hopefully in the near future. While it was working, it was a great laptop. So there's that.*EDIT* Turns out the motherboard also needs replacing, yeah no, I'm returning this laptop.

  This is a beautiful machine with a wonderful specs and price... but didn't work... when I turn on go to BIOS Menu... and nothing else. Maybe a problem with HD... or whatever. I try to fix with the support of Asus... bad idea... contact to the seller... bad idea. Nothing more to do... I will return.UPDATE Jan-2020The computer was the Christmas present for my daughter. For that reason I did not know that I was failing until after Christmas. When I tried to make the return I couldn't do it anymore. Because the technical support of Nexipc and Asus is very little useful I decided to review the problem myself and found that it was the damaged hard drive. I decided to change it and when I opened the machine I found a SATA disk, according to the decal of doubtful origin, of an unknown brand and that is contrary to the specifications of the purchase that indicate that it would have a PCIe Nvme SSD. What annoyance this has caused me! I got scammed! The worst purchase on Amazon you have made. Place a Samsung Evo SSD that has worked perfectly. I did a new installation of Windows 10 64 bit, but I had 3 days of stumbling in trying to install the Asus software. Even installing the MyAsus application, I have had problems when updating. It stays in the process without advancing. What a disappointment this purchase has been.

  I really like this laptop, even though I just got it. Huge difference compared to my previous one, everything boots up in a jiffy! I love the customizable settings for hardcore gameplay and just a regular day to day work computer. It's considerably inexpensive for what you're getting and is completely worth purchasing if you're on a budget.

  Needed about 15-20 updates.  Not uncommon for any PC.  Been playing  Overwatch  at max settings, just raise the laptop an inch off the desk to drop heat. Noise and fan speeds are like any other gaming laptop.Bought it for my son for school , he will enjoy this piece of hardware.  Here's the scores on Passmark Performance Test.

  So I bought the 15.6 inch model 16GB of ram GTX 1650 and advertised with 1tb pcie nvme SSD storage for $1,225. When I hopped into the BIOS just to make sure I got what I paid for it actually had a standard SATA SSD which would be fine but I paid extra for the pcie because it's a much faster storage. I've since returned it and I bought the 17.3 in with the 512 gig pcie storage and that one did come as advertised. Everything about the laptop is good screens great keyboard feels great battery life is good I get about 3 to 4 hours doing standard PLC programming.so in summary it's a great laptop for the money but just make sure you check that you're getting what you payed for.

  I bought this device with such a incredible spec like this. I expected it to be strong. However, after a couple days using it, I have to buy a cooling pad because the keyboard is so hot; I felt like my hands were on a oven. I did expect the laptop will be hot, but I only played auto chess in dota 2 and league of legend which do not require much work from GPU and CPU.Nonetheless, I did expect the laptop to be hot and being said that I bought a cooling pad--a really good one--Thermaltake Massive 20 RGB Steel Mesh Panel Single 200mm Fan. And you know what the keyboard is still super hot.And last but not least, I tried to return it, and I have to pay around $500 for the returning fee despite of the fact that I only used it for a week just in order to test the thermal while playing game. This is such a scam, to be honest.Overall, this seller option is just horrible, 7 days use and have to pay for the returning fee up to $500.

  The laptop is designed very well, smaller and lighter than most 17"" gaming laptops. I have only used it for a couple weeks, but I like it a lot, The front shifted keyboard is different and allows for your body to be back further from the screen for better ergonomic posture (just need a deeper desk surface.)  The track pad (although I don't typically use them) is located on the right side out of the way of your hands while typing, it also functions as a numerical pad with the switch of a button, (There are some issues with the number pad not taking my finger inputs, having to re-tap the pad, but otherwise functions okay) I use the number pad a lot in my business with spreadsheets. It could use a larger SSD card than the 1 TB SSD card installed, (I bought a portable 2TB USB drive to support my work and file storage)  Lots of USB ports available and with a Hub it works great. One drawback is it does not have a LAN port to hard connect to my network, Just Wi-Fi (work around is I bought a Multi USB hub with a network hub and connect that way.) Keyboard is very functional and keys clicks are firm and responsive. (I had a previous ASUS G75VX.TS72 gaming (very large and heavy 16.375"" x 12.5"" x 2"" 9.9 lbs.) and loved it and I replaced it with this one due to my experience with ASUS laptops in the past.  This laptop is lighter and smaller by a inches but maintains the large 17"" screen that I use for my architectural design business (15.7"" x 10.7"" x 0.7 and 5.73 lbs."") Battery lasts a pretty long time for the type of computer but have not been out of my office with it remotely as of yet.  But I've run it unplugged and get about a couple hours on the battery.ASUS produces very great HIGH QUALITY laptops and I have been very pleased, I recommend this product. (I suggest you try to see one in person first and try it out, as the design is different than most laptops, I bought it sight unseen, but am happy with my purchase.)PROS: High quality, powerful, and ergonomic, great design and layout.CONS: No LAN port for hard network connection, Number pad integrated into trackpad is a little cumbersome and not accurate all the time taking finger inputs.

  Only played maybe 4 hours on it.  COD: Modern Warfare.  It runs at super high FPS with mostly everything turned up.  My only gripe is I wish I bought the 17 inch version.  Playing games on a 15 inch screen is a strain on the eyes.  No knock on the rig, that is on me.  I will update my review after some more hours of use.  For the person saying it gets too hot I would say that my fans work great and it doesn't get very hot.UPDATE: It must be made clear by Amazon.  This a 2080 Super Max Q version, not the 2080 Super.  I am not happy about this false advertising.  When I reported it to amazon they simply said they will put in a ticket to fix it.  I bought this product expecting what was listed.

  Everything about this laptop is pretty awesome. It has good keys for typing, nice screen, and an awesome graphics card/processor. The bad side is that the laptop stopped charging just two weeks after I received it. This laptop lived on a cooler while I had it and temps never went about 76c. The laptop has been out for repairs by asus for more than a month now which is unfortunate. Gaming was good and so were the FPS, but be aware that I‚Äôve seen this problem arise elsewhere with newer asus gaming laptops. If you need a dependable laptop I would look elsewhere or be prepared for a potential rma.-update-The fix by the way was a new motherboard which for a laptop may as well be the entire thing! Never had that happen in all my years of owning 5+ laptops, anyways‚Ä¶I received the laptop back from asus and I immediately noticed that the temps were extremely high 98c+. I contacted asus and they told me that it definitely was repasted with liquid metal. I was quite upset at this point and did not trust asus. I opened the laptop up and guess what, regular thermal paste was slathered all over everything! I promptly cleaned it up and repasted it  with thermal grizzly conductonaut in order to bring temps back down to the normal 75-85c  which I had expected to begin with. I would have had to rma it a second time for a few weeks to a month to get the issue resolved. Bottom line is if this laptop goes out on you just return it. Also the power brick gets extremely hot like 130 degrees F while playing games so unless you cool that with a fan chances are it‚Äôs not going to last! I like this laptop but my friend who got the Alienware r17 with the 3080 has had no issues at all and has it running 24/7.  Spend a bit more and get the Alienware trust me.

  The positives: for $1800 great value. 5900HX plus full 130 watts RTX 3070. Perform similar to my desktop gtx 1080ti at 1440p, but 1080p is little behind. I think maybe it‚Äôs the cpu. My desktop 9900k is still faster. The 5900hx average at 4.3 GHz during gaming.  CPU temperatures max peak is 90 degrees and average around 80 or lower. Gpu average 78. Elevate the laptop and temps will lower 3 more degrees. Screen is bright and colorful. The chassis is smaller which made it looked like a 15‚Äù laptop. The fan is not as loud and the chassis is warm but not hot when gaming.The negatives: nvidia Optimus with no mux switch. Depends on the game, expect a performance hit. The only way to bypass Optimus is use an external monitor with usb-c to DisplayPort cable. Built in hdmi port is also lock with Optimus. No Kensington lock hole. No web cam. RGB bar.The reason I returned it. After a couple weeks of light usage and gaming. I started to notice the gpu frequency randomly won‚Äôt go higher than 800 mHz. I did some investigation and found that almost 90% of the time when I first boot up the laptop. All games and benchmark the gpu frequency is lower than 800mhz and the power of the gpu was only below 60 watts. It requires a reboot, not a shut down, to fix the problem. I check bios, windows power management, asus fan settings and everything was normal or no settings available to fix the problem. Please see the picture.I could settle with this laptop with the above negatives. At the time of writing, the value of this laptop is unbeatable. But the above problem is just unacceptable. I would still recommend this laptop, but make sure you test out everything.

  The hardware in the laptop itself is as expected and great. The RTX 3060 In this is the Max-P higher wattage variety. Straight out of the box it benchmarks well, and will play games without much issue*My main gripe with this was related to gaming. Admittedly I jumped into buying this a bit negligently. This model includes the 144hz 1080p LCD. It's not color accurate and it has a painstaking 25ms input delay!Being sensitive to ghosting, I cannot keep this machine.Just do your research before purchasing. The 165hz and 300hz models exhibit much better color accuracy AND 1ms input lag.FINAL NOTE:The backlight bleed is horrible on my particular machine. See my attached images.

  I've been testing this laptop out for a few days now, and overall it's been great. My usage for this is 70% regular computer work (business, light Photoshop, web browsing, etc.) and 30% gaming when I travel as I have a full size gaming rig at home.I bought the  FX505DU, which has the 3750H and the 1660ti.I like the form factor and aesthetics of the device, it doesn't have much flex or ""creakiness"" to it, and it looks great sitting on a desk.The RGB keyboard is a great touch, but wouldn't allow me to change the color until I downloaded an extra piece of software. It cycles through all the colors by default. Other than that everything worked right out of the box and the performance has been very good. The 1660ti is a beast and has destroyed anything and everything I've thrown at it in 1080p.The 3750H cpu has been good as well, though as expected with Ryzen in some CPU intensive games it gets more than it can handle.Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great example. I can play at ultra at 1080p with a locked 30FPS framerate, but if I attempt to get a steady 60fps on any settings, including the lowest, there's just too much going on and it can't do it, even with plenty of GPU headroom. Athens just melts it. Having said that Athens pushes my desktop 9900k, so I don't consider it a negative, just something to keep in mind if you're wanting 1080p60 on everything.The only other games I've tested so far are:The Witcher 3: Steady 60fps on ultra (had to dial back one setting, ""foliage"" to high, and no hairworks). Great experience.Doom 2016: All ultra locked 60 fps using less than 50% of the GPU and CPU. This title can play at 100fps, but it gets too choppy in some high intensity spots, so I lock it to 60 for a smoother experience.Thermals are great, GPU never exceeded 71c at 100% usage, no throttling that i was aware of. Make sure fans are on Turbo, which can be done with a touch of a button on the keyboard, which is awesome.The noise levels during normal usage are fairly quiet, and I appreciate that it has a silent fan setting that can dial things back in case you don't want to let everyone in the classroom or office know you're rocking a gaming rig.Noise levels during gaming were loud, but I've certainly heard much worse from other gaming laptops. I also appreciate that the top of the laptop doesn't get hot, even after prolonged gaming sessions, so you can rest your hands on the keyboard without discomfort.The screen is decent, nothing amazing, but perfectly serviceable, especially considering the price. The 120hz refresh rate is nice for regular usage, but in gaming I've found that the CPU can't get many games past 80-90fps before hitting it's limit, so I've been staying with a locked 60.Also be aware this screen doesn't have any type of adaptive refresh rate (Freesync/Gysnc) so make sure to use Vsync and a frame rate limiter if you want locked frame rates as very few newer games can hit the native 120.This model comes with 2 drives, an SSD and a mechanical hdd. I replaced the hdd with a Samsung Evo ssd, and it took about 5 minutes. The entire bottom comes off the machine after removing all the bottom screws and carefully popping the bottom panel off. I recommend using a plastic separator tool to avoid damage, the tabs were a bit too snug to pop off with just fingers. You also have access to the fans and ram in case you ever need to service and/or clean the dust out.Other than McAfee there isn't much bloatware and the preloaded Asus apps work fairly well.The keyboard and track pad are both comfy and work well. The track pad may turn some people off because it doesn't have separate left/right buttons, but it's large and responsive which is all that I look for.Overall I'm very satisfied with this laptop. It looks great, performs very well, especially considering the price, and feels very durable. My one criticism is the lack of adaptive refresh rate tech, but at this price point that's wishful thinking.Great laptop, definitely recommended.

  I purchased the model with the Ryzen 7 3750H CPU and GTX 1660Ti graphics card. The laptop overall is very fast. The NVME OS drive was able to transfer at over 950 MB/s. Not as great as a Samsung NVME, but still better than a SATA SSD. The secondary D: drive was 1tb, and it's performance was abysmal. It would only write to the drive at 40 MB/s. The dual fans werent overwhelmingly loud when gaming, however they are still running at over 2500 rpm even when the system is idling. Farcry 5 was able to run at over 60 fps on max settings.The reason why I ended up returning this laptop is because of the terrible battery life. I understand that if I'm gaming or using a moderate amount of CPU that the battery life would be terrible. I turned all settings to maximum battery life, both in the asus software, and in the control panel's power settings. I dimmed the display to minimum, and set the refresh rate to 48hz. I used device manager and disabled the GTX1660. The keyboard LEDs were turned off. Wifi was on and connected by itself to a mobile hotspot. The laptop was idling with no apps open and just sitting at the desktop. It was using the minimum amount of power that I could set it at. The battery lasted 1 hour, 15 minutes from 100 percent to 5 percent.Using a kill-a-watt, this laptop was using 50 watts while idling. This is why the laptop's battery was unable to keep up. While playing Farcry 5, the kill-a-watt showed the laptop was using 130 watts.  This is basically a desktop computer with a built in UPS. I would have loved to keep the laptop, but needed to have a low power mode last at least 2-3 hours.

  I bought the metallic 1660ti version and ive had it for a week so far, here is my thoughts:Pro's:1. Noise: It stays pretty cool and quiet even in its loudest mode called turbo. Balanced is completely silent and still decently fast.2. Display: Although small the display is pretty sharp and a nice 120hz. I do wish it had GSync but overall you cant get everything for this great of a price.3. Speed: This thing is quite the monster, its fast with the 1660ti. Im quite impressed by it.Cons:1. Silent mode: There is a mode called silent mode, In my opinion I think that mode is unusable. Its too slow for me. I bet it is good when you are trying to save battery life.2. Now that leads into the next con, battery life. It seems it only lasts around 1 and a half hours even in balanced mode. Maybe im wrong about that but it seems very short.Edit:This has been fixed since this review. ASUS was very quick to bugfix it and I am impressed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. Sleep mode: Sometimes when I close the laptop and try to open it back up the display doesnt start up again. I can still hear the error sound when I type but there is no display, seems like a small bug. I have to usually hard reboot to start it again. I contacted support and they seemed very responsive though. Hope it gets fixed.

  Solid design, super-thin and light. Keyboard feels good. Like the fingerprint login security. Also great connectivity especially for the size. A couple things--1) Win10 comes installed on the 1Tb drive (at least mine did). Had to quickly dupe to SSD and reformat HDD for data only. After doing so, performance skyrocketed, 2) need to load the ATK driver from ASUS to get backlit keyboard to work. Both of the above I consider minor and would pick this platform over the last two (Dell & HP) laptops I have used in my business.

  I was looking for an upgrade from my old 2012 Asus Laptop (which just finally crapped out on me) and this one quickly became a top contender after hours of research. I've got a few pros and cons below.PROS:- The 802.11ac wireless connection really makes a difference. Internet is unbelievably speedy, which makes a huge difference for me since I use lots of heavy web applications for my work.- Applications running on the computer are even faster. Even Premiere Pro runs smoother and easier than it does on my desktop. Keep in mind, my desktop has 12 GBs of RAM, but it's still running on an i5 processor.  With an i7 8th generation processor, this laptop is outstripping everything and can run multiple intensive operations at a time. I often run into problems on my work computer (a Dell) with my web applications crashing when I run too many at a time. Not a problem on this guy.- Battery Life. Battery Life is incredible. Best I've ever seen on any machine. I gave it a full charge at roughly 1PM Sunday, used it for 2 to 3 hours (setting it up, downloading applications, logging into my email), used it on Monday for 5 to 6 hours (doing heavy work), and now I've used it today, Tuesday for over 2 hours, and it just got down to 25% battery capacity. My older laptop would've needed a charge after the first two hours on Sunday. There's a slider in Windows that lets you toggle Battery Saver VS Performance, and that's super handy when on-the-go.- Keyboard. I do lots of typing, and the keyboard feels nice and spaced out. My older Asus laptop had a ""crunched keys"" feeling to it, but this feels really comfortable. I'm not really a keyboard scientist or anything, but I experienced no problems typing on this guy.- Size. The 15.6 screen is really nice, and it gives the entire laptop a bigger, better size than most Asus laptops. My old one was much smaller, and I often paid the price. This one is bigger, lighter, and thinner. Imagine that.- Setup. There was almost no bloatware on this guy other than some of the Asus stuff. It's really refreshing.CONS- Nothing, really. I'll update this review if anything comes up. Not a huge fan of Windows or Cortana, but what are ya gonna do.- I heard the internal fan pick up when using Premiere Pro, but it's pretty quiet and didn't bother me at all. Normally it's nearly silent.- When running for 4-5 hours, it can get a little warm on the bottom. Normally it's perfectly cool.SUMMARYFor the price, easily the best laptop I've ever experienced. This is a MacBook Pro hiding underneath an Asus label and an $800 pricetag.

  This system is amazing, the speed is unmatched in both the processer capabilities and the download speed. The Nano edge display is the best quality laptop screen I've experienced so far. Really an outstanding computer. The only reason it is not a five star is the Battery and charging system. Unlike my other laptops I cannot take the battery out myself, and the cable for charging is not a usb interchangeable one. the wall plugin is big, gets very hot when its both charging the battery and in use at the same time, and as well the battery use alone will not even last six hours of normal use much less 8 as stated, and I have no apps at all on this system and even deleted the ones that came with it so I have no excess internal use. In anycase I am happy with the purchase and will even look to buy another if possible

  I bought this laptop to use for editing video, performing normal office tasks (email and writing code) and video encoding (handbrake) - it does the latter fairly well but the former not so much.  I can't knock a star off for that because the lower power i7 doesn't seem to be the right CPU to use for video editing, my expectations were just too high.What I am taking a star off for is really two things: poor quality and volume of the audio system and the lackluster battery life.  I've used the laptop for a couple hours this morning, mostly watching YT videos, and it's down to 44%, which is a far cry from the supposed ""Full workday freedom"" that is claimed right here on a sticker on the laptop.  If you read the reviews though, you'll see this is a common thread and a noted weakness of the model, so it was fighting an uphill battle from the start.The speakers are pretty terrible, both in terms of volume and quality - and I'm not expecting MacBook Pro type of sound either.  But even with the machine volume at 100% AND YT volume at 100% I could not hear the laptop above my kids playing quietly with their toys.  I know that sounds unrealistic but it's quite true.  If you're going to hook these up to some external speakers then it's a non-issue.I'll be returning mine, but if your needs are lighter than mine then you'll be fine.  We use Dell machines with the same internals at work all day long and they are great for working spreadsheets, writing code and heavy office usage.  Just keep it to those things and you'll be happy.  As long as you use external speakers, or headphones and keep this plugged in or use it sparingly with the battery you'll probably be fine.

  I purchased this as a portable desktop machine (easily moved to another apartment in the winter). I upgraded the Solid State Disk (SSD) from 128 to 512 GB and attached a separate monitor and keyboard/mouse. Everything worked well until I closed the lid and stored it behind the monitor with its not cooling bottom edge resting on a couple of supports. Then it began overheating and shutting down under heavy use at night.I think this is due to the cooling design that exchanges air from behind the keyboard (under the screen hinge) rather from the bottom. When used as a traditional laptop, the screen would be open, not closed, and not partially restricting the air flow.  My heavy use is in the night when I run several cpu intensive jobs that heavily use the SSD.Has anyone else had an overheating issue?In any case, I would not recommend this as a portable desktop replacement. Get a model that is less thin and has more traditional cooling.

  First of all, I purchased this ASUS Q427FL yesterday at a competitor to Amazon. I'm sorry Amazon, the offer was just too good. Anyway, Amazon doesn't carry it in their warehouses at this time - only third-party marketplace units seem to be available here. But at some point it may arrive in their warehouses, so when it does hopefully this helps.This is a high-quality 2-in-1 laptop. It carries the 10th generation i7, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD drive. There is a micro SD card slot, USB-C, USB 3.0, and HDMI. At just below $1,000 the unit is a steal. I've been shopping for two weeks and all I've seen at this price point is 7th or 8th generation CPU units, and most of those cost a few hundred more. I'm still waiting for the catch (and I will certainly update this review if I discover a big negative I overlooked). It's basically the size of a 13"" laptop and very light, but they stuffed a 14"" screen into it with miniscule bezels. The hinges are nice and solid, but not overly stiff. The unit folds back around so it can be used as a tablet. I haven't had a 2-in-1 before, but it looks convenient, and it folds smoothly. I'm used to a giant 17"" Dell XPS laptop - my 11-year old  warrior predecessor to this, so this feels like a toy in comparison and I'll need to get used to it. The touchpad is surprisingly similar in responsiveness and feel to the old Dell, and the keyboard is sturdy. It is not a separate snap-in skirt type keyboard - its base is part of the full deck with the action installed from underneath. I'm not sure if that is good or bad - with the Dell when I experienced a keyboard failure it was removable right from the top. But the trade off is the sturdiness and the polished look. The key response has a solid springiness. It's backlit and the deck is a gorgeous dark brushed aluminum. The dark color would not have been my choice, but I hadn't seen this model in grey or silver, and I wasn't going to reject it over color. I'm thinking the dark color might show scratches and wear more than a light colored laptop would. Oh well. It looks great while it's new.I've seen very little hype over this model. It looks like it was manufactured in August 2019, but only a few select retailers are selling it at this time (January 2020). Scarcity usually drives up the price, but not in this case. It took me a few days to pull the trigger because at this price level I was sure there was a catch. So far I haven't found one. What I found was a genuine bargain. It's an inexpensive (relatively), powerful, versatile piece of tech!Edit: Be aware that this unit does not have a finger print scanner. It has a facial recognition unlock option which seems to work pretty well. Not as secure as a finger print reader, so if this is important to you, you'll need to keep looking. It's the only ""catch"" I've found, but this isn't vital for my purposes. Still gets 5-starts from me. Love this thing!

  Disclaimer: I bought this laptop from bestbuy but I'm going to leave a review here for those who are looking to buy this laptop.Build quality: This laptop is solidly built. The aluminum materials ASUS used makes this laptop light yet strong and durable so you don't have to worry about taking this laptop outside. I've only owned this laptop for a month now and so far there hasn't been any scratches yet.Though I was concerned about the Hinge, it proved to be durable this far. It still closes and opens firmly.The screen also has no scratches so far. I'm not sure what material they used for the screen but it's pretty durable.My only complaint is the exhaust port is located between the hinges of the laptop. When in clamshell mode, the exhaust port is pointing straight at the bottom bezel of the screen. Even though the screen is durable I don't know if long term exposure to the hot air coming from the exhaust port could damage it. This laptops  can get especially hot when using intensive programs such as gaming. However it's not to the point where it's unusable when placing it on your lap.Performance: It still surprises me that this laptop hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves. It has one of the better performance than the other laptops within this price range.It can launch programs pretty fast and can handle multiple tabs open while also having other programs open on the background. I usually have spotify, Microsoft excel,  and chrome with 8 tabs open when I work.This laptop can also load web pages pretty fast.The MX250 GPU and the i7 definitely performs when it comes to gaming. I was able to run witcher 3 on mostly med-high settings at 35-42 fps with 35 being the lowest. Going from high-ultra will drop the fps down to 26-32 fps.Resident evil 3(demo) runs at 32-37 fps with rare drops of 27 fps on medium preset.Starcraft 2 can run on high settings at 60fps(Vsync on) and ultra settings at 45-50fps.Ori and The Blind Forest runs on 60fps with vsync turned on.( I haven't experienced any fps drops)Just a little heads up: The laptop will heat up and the fans will get pretty loud when gaming. So far, I haven't experienced any throttling.Overall, this laptop excels in both build quality and performance compared to other ultrabooks in it's price range. Of course, if you solely looking for a gaming laptop, you can probably find a laptop with a better performance for cheaper. I would recommend  this laptop for college students or people who needs mobile workstations. I am not a tech expert but I am just sharing my experience with this laptop.

  Excellent battery life, excellent industrial design. During COVID I've been working from my car some days just for some variety, and the 180 degree hinge and overall durability & battery life have been great while I multi-task in odd places.Performance-wise, I've been running VirtualBox VMs, Office, Firefox/Chrome, Audio mixing tools, and video capture. All fine. Regarding audio, I was pleasantly surprised at the ASIO driver and the bass in the integrated speakers. Not a pro studio setup of course, but for being fully mobile, it's all rather impressive that I can reasonable record and mix audio on the go.Where I remove one star is the GPU. The GPU is quite slow. In fact in 3DMark this GPU is about 10% slower than my three year old Asus Zenbook. That said, I do appreciate that the panel and LCD driver has a 48 hz option (along with 60 hz). 48 hz does help with more consistent FPS (in the ballpark of what this GPU is capable of), however as an example of the GPU performance I must run Overwatch at 50% scaling mode to hit about 48 FPS.  At least it's playable.This is definitely a business & productivity oriented laptop, but excellent at that.  I can't expect to run any GPU-accelerated CGI or ML on this laptop. But the battery life best in class as far as I can tell, and performance for everything else non-GPU related is quite strong.4/5 stars, would probably buy again unless I can find the same with a better GPU, however it seems non-glossy displays with fast GPUs are hard to find these days.

  I bought this laptop to complement my work laptop, i.e., keep my personal stuff separate from my work stuff. I didn't think I would use it all that much, but it's proven to be such an awesome device, that it's now my go-to device. It's so light, it's also become my tablet replacement.For my home office setup, I have two laptops - one for work and this one. These two laptops share a large Dell curved monitor, along with a Logitech keyboard and mouse. This laptop is plugged in via Ethernet. When I want to work on this laptop, I have to manually switch the monitor, keyboard, and mouse to my #1 setup. I then switch to setup #2 when I work on my work laptop. I also have two video lights (each one is attached behind each laptop). My desktop is ""clean"" even though I have a lot going on.It's easy to detach this laptop from my desk setup and take it somewhere else in the house or on the road. It quickly wakes up as soon as you touch the keyboard and/or open the lid. Within seconds, I'm doing whatever I need to do on the laptop. This is so unlike any other device I've had: I usually have to wait anywhere from 30 secs - 2 mins before a device is ready to be used. This laptop has restored my confidence in Windows 10 devices.

  ASUS has been recently coming out with worse and worse ideas and eventually at this point in 2020 it is impossible to buy a good ASUS laptop no matter how much you spend. This particular model has a keyboard so tight it is impossible to write. Also came with disk partition which is completely useless and takes hours to reconfigure. Time for a macbook.The good: the screen as with most ZENBOOK and EXPERTBOOK models.The bad: loud fan, avergage performance, design and ergonomics + PRICE!

  I like Asus laptops, this ExperBook is a small nice solid laptop but was disappointed that this pro laptop performance not that great. It's expensive and high-end pro more for business, but slow, sometimes the track pad does not respond. If wasn't a performance issue, this laptop is very nice looking.

  (CLARIFICATION: This review is specifically for the K570UD-ES76, which includes the i7 processor & 16gigs of RAM.  Don't let the 2 & 3 star reviews fool you: most of those that I've seen are for the i5 processor version, and that's an entirely different computer for all intents and purposes.  Also, the pictures I've included are after 3 months of use; my keyboard has a dust-cover over it.)My first (and only) ever laptop was the ASUS K55A-DB51, so that is technically my only point of reference for comparison.  Considering that the K55A lasted the better part of 5 years, I decided to stick with ASUS upon deciding to get a new laptop.(I should note that my K55A is still perfectly functional: the reason for the upgrade is that 1] 5 years of wear & tear as a college student have taken their toll, and 2] the software can no longer keep up with my work.)Here's the basic comparison:K55A  - i5-3210M  Processor, 8Gb RAM, Intel HD 4000 Graphics, Windows 7.K570UD - i7-8550U Processor, 16Gb RAM, Geforce 1050 GTX Graphics, Windows 10Definitely an upgrade.As of 6/30/2018, it has been two whole days since I received the K570UD, and it is a world of difference in comparison!  I will be judging the laptop overall by Software, Interface & Connection, and Casing & Durability.Software: 4.8 / 5Immediately upon finishing the basic setup I put the software on this laptop to the test, using several games to push the software as hard as I could.  The first thing I fired up was Wargaming's World of Warships (Set to Medium graphic settings w/ 4x anti-aliasing; my K55A could handle it on Low graphics), while simultaneously downloading & Installing about 6 different other games via Steam, while also playing a YouTube playlist in the background.  I had 2 web browsers open (including the one with YouTube) during this time (Google Chrome & Firefox: Sorry Edge, but your predecessor makes it hard for me to trust you).  I ran the machine for a good three hours this way.  During that time I hit 60% memory usage on average with occasional bursts to 100%, but it never slowed my laptop down or interrupted my gameplay.  The GPU usage never went above 78%, so I am confident that I could set the graphics on World of Warships even higher if I wanted to.  The CPU was all over the place, hitting 100% several times every other minute or so, which caused very brief (no more than 1 second) hiccups in gameplay, but I hardly even noticed them.If I did this on my K55A, it would punch me in the face right before it blew up in my face...The fact that I was actually on Power Saving mode (didn't realize that until after this little test) makes this even more impressive to me!I also ran SolidWorks (one of my engineering programs) on a separate (and more realistic of my intended use) test, and it ran flawlessly.Interface & Connection: 3.8 / 5There are two USB ports and an audio-jack on the left side.  The right side has one USB, a USB-C (never used one of those before), an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a Micro-SD slot (as well as the charging port).  Very similar to the layout on the K55A, except its in reverse (On the K55A most of the ports are on the left side vs the right).  This layout actually makes it slightly inconvenient since I'm right-handed, and if I have an Ethernet cable plugged in it gets in the way of my mouse when I use it.  Of course if you're left handed, this shouldn't be a problem, and even then it's not so inconvenient as to be unworkable.  The thumb scanner is easy enough to use if set up properly.Another rather curious issue is the absence of indicator lights for the CAPS Lock, Scroll Lock, and Num-Lock keys.  I don't know why they would exclude them, but it makes it difficult to know if they are on or not.During my little ""test"" there were some minor heating issues near the back of the laptop, but the rest of the keyboard and pad stayed cool throughout the test.Casing & Durability: 4.6 / 5 (Updated)My K55A went through a lot in 5 years, and still runs quite nicely.  That said, I can't vouch for the K570UD's long term durability quite yet.  Since I am a Mechanical Engineer, I can at least give some pointers.The casing over the keyboard appears to be aluminum; the rest is plastic.  The case covering the screen is slightly flexible, but not enough for me to worry.  11 screws secure the bottom cover, and all eleven need to be removed to reach the inside components.  (I kind of miss the K55A setup here: that one has a panel that when removed gives access to all up-gradable components, and only required two screws be removed.)The heating vents are all in the back of the laptop, which I don't mind. (It's actually nice not having a heating vent toasting my left hand anymore).Overall, I'd say it's more durable than my old K55A, so I expect to get a good 3-4 years of use out of it as long as I take care of it.UPDATE - 9/17/18: After three months, I am quite impressed by how well my K570UD has held up.  The only problem I have encountered is that the bezel near the back has developed minor wear, likely from rubbing against the inside of the backpack I carry it in (My backpack has a slot specifically for a laptop).  It's minor enough that I'm not too concerned, but I have now included pictures.Conclusion:I bought this knowing that it was not the ""best of the best"" out there.  I spent a good 3 months researching various laptops before I decided on this one, and even then only after researching the K570UD for a good 2 weeks.  As such, I was aware of what to expect long before I had even bought it, and so far I have yet to encounter anything that I didn't expect.  ASUS likes to strive for excellence, and I think they did so here.My criteria were very simple: I wanted a laptop that was more than capable of handling my school work, and better than my K55A in all specs.  The K570UD is not the best, but it is more than enough to handle anything outside of VR.  If you're like me and looking for an upgrade from an older laptop, then this is a fantastic machine to upgrade to!  If you're a PC gamer and want to play games but you don't really care about 4K graphics, this machine will get the job done!  And if you're a college student that wants a good laptop that can handle hefty programs, then I can also recommend this to you!I cannot recommend this to you if you:Want only the absolute best.Want to take over the world (unless it's a game world, then maybe).Want a laptop that is also a Swiss army knife.  Literally.Are on a budget of under $1,000.Are actually shopping for shoes and you have no idea how you got here.Thus, my rating is 5/5 stars for personal satisfaction, 4.55/5 stars for meeting/exceeding expectations.  I will update this review as I see fit.P.S. A lot of reviews I've seen mentioned dings & pits on the screen.  I had no such issues, so if you encounter that I would suggest you contact customer support or the folks at Amazon, and I'd bet they can sort you out.-UPDATE - 7/19/18: I have encountered an issue that warrants a heads up I believe.  The computer still works great, but I have repeatedly had issues with WiFi connection; whenever my computer wakes up from sleep or hibernation, it seems to have increased difficulty locating or finding connections.  Right-clicking on the WiFi icon and activating the troubleshooter usually fixes this problem (Usually the troubleshooter just resets the WiFi connection/receiver).  Once it does connect, it's smooth sailing and connection all the way, so this is mostly a minor inconvenience.  I haven't determined if this is hardware or software related, so I won't change the score on my review until I determine that.-UPDATE - 9/17/18: Thank you to those who responded in regards to the WiFi issues.  I've confirmed that it's a Windows problem, so my score remains unchanged.  I want to add that most of the issues I had (few as they may be) have been traced to Windows, and not the computer itself. I also added pictures showing my laptop 3 months later.

  Recently, I picked up the i7 version with 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD. I wanted a laptop that could be primarily used for working in Illustrator, Photoshop, and other Adobe CC apps, but could also play some games. It was also important to me that it could be run off a battery for web browsing, email, writing, etc. at places like coffee shops and airports. So far this has been able to do all of those things decently well.The monitor is okay, there is a kind of dot pattern/matrix that you can see if you look closely. I'm not sure if it is from the matte coating, or has something to do with the internal workings of the screen itself, but it doesn't really bother me. In Photoshop it seems workable so far, we'll see when I have to paint in light yellows, blues, pinks. I don't expect it will be that bad. I had an older Dell XPS 15z laptop in the past that had a much stronger pattern that was visible and I was able to do work on it just fine.For gaming, Overwatch worked fine out of the gate at medium settings. However, at High Graphics, the laptop would shut off after about 15 minutes or so. I checked the temps using Open Hardware Monitor and the CPU and GPU were hitting the high 90s C. I ended up lowering the max CPU settings in Power Options to 75%, and setting the graphics in Overwatch to Low and now the CPU is at 65¬∞C and GPU around 69¬∞C peaking out under max load (btw - Overwatch's Low settings still look great). Everything is working well now. Hearthstone and Civ 5 ran great without any modifications necessary. The heating problems are not uncommon for alot of gaming laptops from what I've seen during my research, even some of the bulkier ones. As long as you set things up properly then you should be fine. Which is a bit annoying, but for me isn't the end of the world.I like that this laptop is relatively light and portable. The battery life seems pretty good and will easily last 3-4 hours at a coffee shop or library (if not gaming). It doesn't seem bulky at all to me. Most of the other gaming laptops in this price range that I saw were bulky and not portable. It has the features I wanted, and I'm happy with it. Oh and just to mention: mine had the right i7 8th gen sticker.

  good design, but.......yellowish screen....most importantly, Network adapter has a big problem.The network adapter started to fail keeping wifi connection in 2 weeks after I bought this laptop.I spent a lot of time to fix this problem, including asking Asus Service Center, I followed all the solutions I could try, all failed. I sent this laptop to Asus Service Center 3 times for the repair, and none of these repair were effective more than one week.....Basically I hardly used this laptop even 4 month passed after the purchase.. and I currently sent this laptop to the Asus Service Center  *(This is 4th sending my laptop...). Today I received email that they want me to pay more than $500 dollars to repair. This is total nonsense. 4 months of suffering. If I bought other brand's laptop at this price, I would be very happy.Here is my advice: Don't buy it. If you are unfortunate, you basically cannot use the laptop( I mean wifi...but no doubt that wifi is very very important)If you already decided to buy it, I hope your laptop does not have any problem...

I thought that was making this machine slow and I wanted to erase everything down to a simple windows 10 install with nothing more but had issues with the usb boot disk getting to boot from the bios. After wrestling with windows for 8 hours, I gave up on my dualboot intentions and just erased the whole thing and installed Antergos linux. The trackpad issue remains a problem and really gets in the way of my productivity.After searching and reading more reviews specifically about trackpad performance, it seems that Asus laptops have this issue across all of their Zenbooks going back to 2011. The only fix I've seen suggested is to remove the casing and tape a piece of tinfoil between the battery and trackpad. I think I'd rather just return the laptop and get my $1,500 (included 4 year warranty).There are plenty of other comparable machines at the $1,200 to $1,500 price point. I can get myself a MacBook Air for that price!

  I love this laptop. It's the perfect student laptop for those in engineering or demanding fields. I run virtual machines daily, play light games, and mess around on Reddit and YouTube with this laptop. It's great.However, the trackpad has SERIOUS issues. The trackpad will lag at the worst times and make the cursor jump around like crazy. It works most of the time, but the lag will happen every 5-10 minutes. Get a wireless mouse and save yourself the trouble.If you can deal with a buggy trackpad, this is the perfect laptop for you.UPDATE: There is a fix below in the comments that helps make the trackpad work much better.Also personal fixes I did that helped:* Turned off anything to do with tapping (single, double, multi select taps off)UPDATE 2 - I didn't update this for a while, however there is a firmware update released months ago for the trackpad and now there's no issues, so +1 star for me. Also, for Linux users - I run Ubuntu on this in dual boot and it works great. The numberpad doesn't work though and I doubt it will in the forseeable future.

  I took a big risk buying this machine, based on the critical Amazon reviews regarding the trackpad, but I had a feeling there would be a fix from the manufacturer. My bet paid off! Went to Asus.com to seek solutions, and with a simple firmware update, the jumpiness of the trackpad was gone, and I was left with an otherwise excellent laptop.I've always been a big Asus fan, so when these sleek, new, uniquely hued, machines came out just as I was seeking a replacement for my 6-year-old previous ZenBook, I jumped at the opportunity to buy one. SO very glad I did, because this is such a lovely device. I was a little skeptical of the color and new build, but it has certainly grown on me, and I get compliments frequently.Perhaps the hardest thing to get used to, and maybe a con if you're a big accessories fan, is that with the tiny bezel around the screen, there's no need for much vertical length on the machine, so it's *much* more rectangular than the laptops you might be used to. This means that the sleeve that comes with this laptop is one of the few snug-fitting protective accessories you'll be able to find.I haven't used this machine for much heavy-duty work yet, but I will update this review once I've downloaded and used Adobe Creative Suite on it, and report on its handling of some of these juggernaut programs. That being said, everything I *have* run has been great. The speeds to load are fantastic, and the loaded version of Windows does well on the machine.Some of my favorite features:The backlit keyboard with multiple brightness settingsThe function-lock options (notably absent on past Asus models, which was annoying)The light-up number pad (more a party trick than anything, but is actually pretty useful when I *do* need to take on some number crunching)The battery life - WOW. Charges fully in about 1.5 hours, and I've gotten it to last up to NINE hours on that chargeThe aesthetic - This machine is gorgeous, and nobody is going to deny that. The slim bezels, the overall thin profile, the blue and gold color... its just so dang pretty.I was certainly disappointed with *how* jumpy the touchpad was at first, but with the simple fix and the excellent machine you're left with after, this is a great deal on a lovely machine.PS: I haven't experienced the coil whine so many users here have talked about. I'm on the machine in a silent room now, for instance, and all I can hear is my own typing. *shrug*

  After not even 1 day of usage, the laptop crashed and did not reboot.So far I have spent:- 30 min with an Amazon cust rep who ended up recommending that I buy a new charger- 3 days wait to get the charger. Tried it. No power still.- 2h with another Amazon cust rep who ended up liaising with ASUS US and concluded that I needed to contact ASUS France on the phone number she provided me- 5 minutes today with an ASUS France customer rep, who were rather rude and unhelpful.I am now returning the merchandise to Amazon who are pushing back. What a nightmare. I'll update my rating if the situation ends up being sorted out.

  UPDATE: 4/20/2018I have changed the rating from 4 stars to 1 star.It has been about a year since I purchased this laptop. The laptop worked fine at first. However, as time went on, sometimes the laptop would boot to a black screen. The power LED was on and you could hear the hard drive spinning so it was on but the display remained black. I searched the ASUS forums and saw that other people shared the same issue with this laptop. A hard shut down (hold the power button until it boots off completely) helped to resolve the issue temporarily. The laptop would boot normally after a hard shut down. However, in the past few months, the issue became progressively worse. About a month ago, the laptop would boot the black screen but a hard shut down and reboot no longer worked. The screen remained black. I RMA'd the laptop to ASUS for repair. They replaced the RAM. The same issue persisted. I RMA'd the laptop again. They replaced the motherboard. The same issue persisted.A long story short, ASUS only offered a replacement. I did not choose that and instead spoke with Amazon, who kindly offered me a partial refund on the laptop. The fact that the two RMAs did not resolve the issue and that the issue is not uncommon (one can see on the ASUS forums many people have similar issues) leads me to believe this is a poor and faulty product.I would think carefully if you are deciding whether or not to purchase this laptop.My review below still stands in the scenario the laptop works. However, paying the amount of money for this laptop to essentially have a brick after a year is no good at all.Due to the RMA experience with ASUS and their customer support, I will no longer ever be purchasing ASUS products ever again unless there's a way to avoid having to go to ASUS for support (e.g. Microcenter's purchased warranties).There seems to be a lot of questions and sometimes misinformation floating around about this laptop so I'll answer the most common ones I see from online in this review.Is the display 1920x1080? Yes.Is the display IPS (In-plane switching)? Yes.Is the refresh rate of the display 120 Hz? Yes.Does the display have G-Sync? Yes.What form factor is the SSD? It is M.2.Is the memory dual channel? Yes, it's 2x8 GB.Is the power supply 230 W (probably the most common question for this model)? Yes. See the attached image I took of my GL502VS-DS71 and the power supply it came with.You can see the output is 19.5 V (Volts) and 11.8 A (Ampere). Volts * Ampere = Wattage (W). 19.5 V * 11.8 A = 230.1 W.How hot does the GPU run? From my testing of games, which were The Witcher 3, Overwatch, and Dragon Age: Inquisition, the GTX 1070 hit an average of 77 degrees Celsius with a peak of 81 degrees Celsius during extended gameplay. The ambient temperature in my room during this was about 23 degrees Celsius.How hot does the CPU run? When running the CPU on stock voltage, the CPU hit an average of 87 degrees with a peak of 93 degrees Celsius in the above mentioned games during extended gameplay. When I undervolted the CPU by -140 mV (this can be done either by Intel Extreme Tuning Utility or Throttlestop), the CPU hit an average of 83 degrees Celsius with a peak of 89 degrees Celsius in the above mentioned games during extended gameplay. The ambient temperature in my room during this was about 23 degrees Celsius.Now, the thing that jumps out the most probably is the CPU temperature. Is that safe? Well, according to Intel's website, the T junction for the i7-7700HQ is 100 degrees Celsius. I'll copy and paste Intel's definition of T junction below:""Tjunction Max is the maximum temperature the cores can reach before thermal throttling is activated. Thermal throttling happens when the processor exceeds the maximum temperature. The processor shuts itself off in order to prevent permanent damage. Tjunction Max (Tj Max) is also referred to as TCC Activation Temperature in certain processor datasheets.""Intel also provides the following information on Tjunction, which I'll copy and paste below:""These terms are related to processor temperature for desktop and mobile systems based on Intel¬Æ Processors. To allow optimal system operation and long-term reliability, the processor must not exceed the maximum case temperature specifications as defined by the applicable thermal profile.""So at least according to Intel, these CPU temperatures would be within spec. An average of 87 with a peak of 93 degrees Celsius is cutting it close though. I'd recommend undervolting, which gave me an average of 83 with a peak of 89 degrees Celsius, to give a little more headroom under the T junction. I wouldn't call these temperatures the greatest but considering the form factor of the laptop, they seem okay.Now for some miscellanous information:What color is the keyboard's LEDs and can it be turned off? Red and yes the keyboard's LEDs can be turned off via Fn +F3. The setting will stick with reboots.Does the laptop come loaded with ASUS's software (or bloatware if you prefer to call it that)? Yes and there's plenty of it. It's annoying but every manufacturer does that. Just uninstall it if you don't want it. This is a time to bring up something annoying regarding design decision. ASUS decided to put a key with the ASUS logo where the num lock key usually is (the num lock key is instead a Fn shortcut on the Home key right above). This key is meant to launch ASUS'S Gaming Center. If you uninstall ASUS's Gaming Center, the key is useless.In addition, as far as I can tell from researching online (as of April 2017), no other laptops out there have the specs of this laptop AND an IPS display. The other brands (e.g. MSI, Dell Alienware, or Sager / Clevo) have laptops that can match the GL502VS-DS71's spec for spec EXCEPT they have a TN (Twisted Nematic) panel instead of an IPS panel.I hoped this review helped to inform your decision as to whether or not to purchase this laptop.***Update 5/28/17***I looked into controlling the fan speed of the laptop. It looks like NoteBook FanControl does not have this model yet in their application so it can't control the fan speed. However, I discovered that with the Asus Gaming Center you can control the fan speed. I found that the default auto profile has the fan running at about 3300 RPM during gaming load. I decided to turn the fan speed to max, which is now about 4400 RPM. This has further dropped the temperatures for the CPU/GPU I had above by a few degrees. The downside is now the fan is much louder owing to the faster RPM.I also decided to drop my review to 4 stars considering how the user has to implement these workarounds to bring the CPU to more manageable temperatures.The laptop out of the box with stock settings does run too hot. However, if you're willing to utilize Intel Extreme Tuning Utility or Throttlestop (to undervolt the CPU) and to enable 100% fan speed whenever you're gaming with the ASUS Gaming Center, the temperatures are much better. The issue is that you would have to enable these settings each and every time you want to game. With Intel Extreme Tuning Utility or Throttlestop, you could google how to set them as a basic task to be executed at every log on via the Windows Task Scheduler so you don't have to open them every time. As for the fan speed, you can't set a user defined fan curve via the ASUS Gaming Center unfortunately.The last option (if you're looking to drop temperatures as much as possible) is to undervolt the GPU as well. One example is using MSI Afterburner's voltage curve editor. You can edit the curve so that the GPU sits at 0.800 V only. I chose to forego this option since it would mean your GPU would be running at lower clocks speeds, which results in lowered performance in games.Basically, be aware that if you aren't willing to do the workaround I talked about, this laptop runs a bit too hot. If you are willing to do the workarounds, the temperatures are much more acceptable but the downside of course is that the user has to put in all this effort.

  Updating this review:I've come to the conclusion that currently their is no perfect gaming laptop. I've spent hours researching, and everyone of them has a flaw. Some more then others. I did end up returning this laptop. It's close, but the entire reason why I purchased it was to play games on the couch. The flaws listed below is something I could not live with at this price point.Here are a few examples from my research:-Alienware R3/R4 model has major thermal problems caused by production issues... that are still unresolved, and the company is not standing behind the product.-MSI good cooling with the GT series... but the 15.6'' screen does not have 120hz, and it's thicker.-Acer predator runs cooler, but it's big, and build quality is cheap.-Gigabyte Good build quality, runs hot.- I settled on a Clevo laptop. Seemed to have the best of all systems, with minimal flaws.ASUS:Pros:+Good build quality The aluminum lid is nice, wish the base was aluminum as well. But the plastic does not feel bad, just doesn't have the ""High end feel"" I'd like from this price point.+Runs everything on high, with good FPS+Boots quick, very responsive.+120hz G-Sync makes everything run feel buttery smooth. No screen tears in gaming, and navigating the web feels nice.+Can pass as a professional laptop gaming ""style"" is minimal.Cons:-When open; the screen blocks the exhaust vents; and actually redirects the hot exhaust into the fan intakes.-The normal Num Lock key was moved to a function key on the pause/break key. In place of the old numlock key is an asus ROG proprietary program shortcut. (Come on guys. Really? Leave standard keys alone!)-I've seen the system discharge slowly when plugged-in while running demanding games. For whatever reason Civ 6 is one.-Wish the build was a bit more ""premium"" with a full aluminum chassis, and a 256gb solid state drive.-Keyboard font is terrible, hard to differentiate between some characters.-Keyboard Backlight makes characters hard to see at an angle (red lighting around key is brighter then the key character it self)-Wish the touch pad had dedicated buttons.Temps: when playing BF1 on the table with and without a cooling mat.Without Mat: CPU 97deg, GPU 89deg (both were throttling)With mat: CPU 83deg, GPU 82degThe cooling mat displaced the hot air from the exhaust fans, and let the intake actually pull in cool air. Made a huge difference in temps.Take Aways:The ASUS 502 is a good, but not a perfect laptop. A few bad design choices keep it from making it a top-tier product.The thermal solution seems to work good when fresh cool air is available, but when the open screen directs the heat back into the fan intake, its creates temperature problem during gaming.Make the laptop all aluminum, throw in a 256gb SSD instead of the 128. Cut some better vents into the bottom of the chassis, it would be a perfect system.Bottom Line:Every gaming laptop has flaws currently. With this laptop use a cooling mat when you game, and enjoy. Price vs performance, it's currently hard to beat with the current generation of 1070 laptops.

  So far this laptop has been one of the best laptops I've ever bought. I was searching for something thin and light to carry with me so I could work on the go, but I'm also a gamer so I wanted something I could have a good experience gaming on as well. The problem I kept running into was that a lot of thin laptops with a high end GPU (1070, 1080, etc.) were pairing the GPU with a 4K screen. I didn't want a 4K screen at 15 - 17 inches. I favor framerate and g-sync over resolution; and besides that a 1080p 17 inch screen already boasts a higher pixel density than my 27 inch 1440p g-sync monitor. At 4K I'd have to sacrifice visual options and frame rate for screen resolution. Pairing a 1070 with a 1080p high refresh rate screen was the sweet spot for me.It worked out pretty good. This laptop is under 7 pounds, so super light for me, and is around an inch thick on average. The 512GB SSD loads all my applications for work super fast, and the 1TB HDD is there for larger projects, games, media, etc. The keyboard has a good feel to it, the build of the laptop is sturdy, and the 120hz monitor is nice, clear and responsive. It also has all the connection ports I'd need.While this laptop does everything I need it to do, there is one issue. The CPU gets hot during demanding games (due to two heat pipe shared CPU-GPU cooling system) and causes it to throttle back from its maximum speed. I'd recommend anyone who picks one of these up to undervolt the CPU. Done properly you get the same stability, but lower temps which means your CPU can operate at its maximum frequency. This also has the benefit of letting your laptop run longer on battery.It's light, it's fast, it's powerful, and the build quality is sturdy. I highly recommend it.

  Reduced original rating by another star due to ASUS tech support and their statements about the unit.After  receiving the G712LW, I immediately  upgraded it by replacing the 2 - 8gb sticks with 2 - 16gb for a total of 32gb. I also added 2 - 2tb PCIe SSDs to the empty slots. I cloned the OS from the original boot drive to the other drives and checked to see which was the fastest.  It turned out to be the Inland Premium (by Microcenter) which booted from start of BIOS to lock screen in just under 7 seconds. So  I went back to BIOS and set that drive as boot.After loading my essential programs, I left the system up, but untouched for a couple of days. Then it happened. Here is a copy of the email I sent to ASUS:""I am having a weird problem with my new ASUS ROG G712LW. I have added ram to 32gb, and 2 - 2tb PCIe SSD drives, an Inland Premium (by Microcenter) and a Mushkin Pilot-E (MKNSSDPE2TB-D8). Both additions are recognized by BIOS and Windows and seem to be working well. However, if the system is left up and inactive, after a day or 2 windows stops seeing the 2 non-system drives. That includes the original Intel 500gb drive, and one of the 2 tb drives. The Intel drive is still in its original slot. Currently the Inland is the boot drive. Rebooting Windows does nothing. However, rebooting into BIOS shows all 3 drives and, without any changes, the save and exit F10 into Windows and all drives are there. This has occurred twice so far. Any way you can help me here?""As you can see, everything was as it should be... then it wasn't. After a few days I received this reply from ASUS tech support:""Thank you for contacting ASUS Product Support. My name is Tevon B. I do hope you are having a great day. I would like to welcome you to the ASUS family and I extend my sincerest apology for all the inconvenience that you might have experienced. I am happy to help you resolve your issue by providing you with the best possible solution.I understand that you added a 32GB RAM and a 2TB PCie SSD to your device and the work fine but if the device is inactive for a day or 2, Windows will no longer recognize the 2 drives. Based on the issue you explained, the ASUS ROG G712LW does not support 32GB RAM. Your device supports 16GB DDR4 RAM and a 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD. This might be the reason why the device does not recognize the drives as they are not supported by the device. If you can, please remove the updated drives and then check if the issue persists. Thank you for the opportunity to address this matter with you. We value you as an important ASUS customer and we want to ensure your experience with us is fulfilling.""To which I responded:First off, are you kidding me? You are telling me that the latest model that ASUS produces, a high-end ROG model intended for gaming, will not support 32gb of RAM in a 2 x 16gb format? And, that the same notebook, which has 3 PCIe slots internally, will only support ONE stick of SSD storage no larger than 512gb? Are you truly trying to convince me of that? If so, you need to look at your own spec sheet for the G712LW which completely refutes your statement.The notebook does recognize the components in BIOS. Windows 10 recognizes them as well. The question I asked is why does the system shut them down after too long an inactivity. And it is a system problem,  not a Windows 10 problem, since just accessing BIOS makes the missing drives accessible to Windows.If you do not know, PLEASE bring in a tech who can understand.I am now awaiting a reply to that. Maybe someone who actually knows the product, or can, at least read the spec sheets, will respond.UPDATE: ASUS TS insists that their latest notebook for gaming doesn't support 2tb of PCIe NVMe SSD storage.My reply:I can't believe what you are still trying to lay on me.I especially can't believe that ""this notebook supports 1tb per slot. Does not support 2TB per slot.""I have two other, older ROG units, a 10 year old G74sx and a 7 year old G750JW. Both have 3 internal 2tb SATA SSD drives.  So you are now trying to convince me that the latest technology can't handle 2tb of storage? I don't remember, and can't find, that in the specs or in any reviews. Please show me that in the computer's documentation.I also can't believe it because a 2tb PCIe SSD is my boot drive and it works flawlessly.As well, both 2tb PCIe drives are seen by BIOS. The same G712LW.310 BIOS that came installed, and which you have told me to upgrade to. Please read my prior communications.I also am having a problem with that statement, since one of the two drives that disappears from Windows is only 512gb, the original boot drive, still in its factory slot.All available updates have already been accomplished, including the optional Intel drivers.Something in BIOS is turning off the non-system drives after 24 hours of computer inactivity. Please stop trying to BS me about this and find the fix.

  Before I got this laptop for the past 6-7 years I had an Asus ROG laptop with a Geforce 860m in it.  It finally was on its last legs so I decided to buy another Asus ROG as it had been so reliable and tough to boot.  When I got my new laptop I liked the look of it.  It booted up and did typical setup things Update windows..install programs I use etc.  A few things I noticed that kind of annoyed me about this laptop...usb ports were put on the left instead of right side.(I have many backup/external drives that are on the right side of my desk and due to the position of the chair/leg area I do not have much room on the left for those things.) A minor inconvenience of course..also the reduction of 4 usb ports to 3 is a bit of an inconvenience too as I have both a wireless mouse and headset that I use leaving only 1 port free most of the time. Though to be honest I knew about that to begin with, but it would be nice to have more ports without needing an external hub.  Again these are small inconveniences.  I do enjoy having the HDMI port on the back so its out of the way of things on my desk, same for the power plug.  My one real gripe about the HDMI is that whenever its plugged in the resolution changes to a lower one due to it thinking that my laptop screen is the HDTV that I have connected to it to watch movies/youtube on via my laptop.  Once I unplug it though it goes back to the right resolution for both video editing and gaming.  This leads to another issue I ran into with this laptop.  If you want to play any high end games such as COD: Warzone you have to go into the provided software ARMORY CRATE to change your settings from silent to performance or turbo to get the performance needed or else things tend to lockup or crash.(EDIT - after some driver updated and fiddling with the nvida software which was the problem in the long run as it was fighting for control all the time with the ARMORY software that is provided with the laptop.  I like the ARMORY but not enough to fight it so I disabled its control of the graphics decisions and said let windows do it which it in turn said Nvidia can play with things...which is what you really want as they know the graphics chip better than Asus does. So it plays great now.)  I'm an experienced IT guy so for me it was an easy find/fix...but for the average gamer it would be a big thing as there is nothing saying to do that.  I will also say that though the laptop is thinner..the fans are louder when in performance/turbo mode its so loud you can barely hear things in game(EDIT: When in TURBO MODE/ARMORY) unless you crank the volume up quite a bit so I would suggest again that if you have the time find your way through to disable ARMORY's control of things and just let Nvidia and windows handle gpu controls as they are more efficient in doing it.  my last laptop even when the fans were going full throttle did not make this much noise, so that is a little disappointing to say the least.  So I will say these are things that they need to address better In the future.  Personally I could careless about battery life all together due to my using my laptop as a space saving pc instead of a portable gaming rig.  I will also say to you if you are thinking of buying this model...get the one with the 1 or 2 TB drive in it as this one did not have a slot for SSD drive(non M.2/nvme).  So the 512GB Intel m.2 2280 one notch nvme that came with this is being eaten up quick and I can't use my recently bought(3 months ago) 2TB non-m.2 SSD drive with this laptop at all. There is no brackets or holding cage for one...there is no ribbon connector...nada! At least include the 1TB or a big notice this only has M.2 ports. (second one is used by your internal wifi card. so between the SSD and Wifi you are left with two NVMe M.2 2280 one notch ports.)  You really need one drive for your OS only...then secondary drive for programs and games/video editing temp storage to get the best gaming/video editing performance possible.  Again battery life is not a big deal for most gamers.  Though if you are traveling sure a bit of battery life is great...but most places have plugs to hook your laptop into..there are even ac to cigarette lighter port adapters for cars/trucks so you have that too.  I do not know of anyone who wants to go out into the middle of the boonies to play their games.  So again gaming doesn't equal need for battery life.  Oh yeah in case you are wondering which M.2 drive is in this laptop its the Intel one..and the read/write speeds are in the 1500 mbps read/write speed. (I've Edited this after fiddling with windows and using Crystal disk test which brought up the performance from what it was as I had to disable the silent mode I had the system on again..fighting ARMORY. smh Asus.) Not the fastest M.2 but a huge leap from the previous write speeds so its better than it was over all.  Also would it really kill you to make the upgrading areas easily accessible rather than having to ripoff the whole gosh darn(insert swear words here.) thing off to get access to memory/hard drive for upgrading?  While I love the overall quality of the products of the ROG line...I've seen and even talked to other friends who own the 2 steps or so above what I got ($2k to $3k spent of course.) and they are all better laptops than this...so I would say go ahead save up the 2 plus grand for the higher end of the strix if you want a better built and slightly better ease of access for upgrade gaming laptop.  Still if you are one who likes to fiddle and mess with stuff builders/tinkerers/hackers..etc...  Then go ahead and get this laptop.  With just a little bit of user end thoughts ASUS you could have made this into a better laptop than it was...I'm disappointed in you, but I still like (better now that I have fixed the quirks of your software.) the laptop overall...though I'm sure if I break anything taking it a part completely just to install a new m.2 drive you will not cover its warranty...just saying its hard to open and take a part more than it should be for close to 2k that I paid for this.  If I sound grippy about this...I think there is fair reason to be so.  ASUS DO BETTER PLEASE!  I love your products when I was building PCs and would always recommend your MBs and Video Cards to people...do better and think more about the End Consumer more when doing your case for these gaming laptops.  That said the looks of the laptop and now the performance at least come close to what I was expecting.

  So the laptop itself is very nice and clean looking. The weight is pretty light for a 17in laptop. The feel of the keyboard is great to me and gaming on it has been flawless. I have had no issue playing any game or watching any movie and the screen quality has been splendid.Noe for the flaw. The rgb keyboard is nice but it isn't per key rbg and for the regular price of 1700, it should have been. The sound quality is horrible and the mic is trash. The sound, sounds very cheap and i been told by many of my friends through discord that they can barely hear me even tho i max out the setting for the mic. I end up just buying a better quality headset for the laptop.Over all i think it is a great laptop to use. If you don't mind not having per key rbg for keyboard and plan to get a headset for this laptop then i think it you're really like the laptop. I got the laptop when it was on sale for 1450 so I'm very happy with what i got but for people who might be paying full price, they should know about the rbg and the sound/mic for this laptop.Beside the 3 issues i mention, everything has been awesome and i would like to have a special mention of the wifi for those who planning to use the the laptop on the go like me. The wifi has been amazing for me. This was actually the second laptop i got because the first one i had to return because the wifi for the first laptop was horrible and kept disconnecting from the internet.

  The left CPU fan went bad in a week. This is the second Asus ROG I've had in a year that went bad within a month. Bad quality. Buy a Razer.

  So I bought a razer laptop here in 2021. It arrived basically dead on arrival. I thought no big deal, got a replacement. Razer sent me a second computer that had a different horrible problem. Then their customer service was a garbage fire.That‚Äôs what brought me to this. I bought this computer since my entire desktop pc build was using asus parts. Man they hit it out of the park with this laptop.  If you are on the fence on what brand you should get, don‚Äôt be. Asus is the way to go. This thing plays every game I‚Äôve thrown at it at ultra graphics with rtx on (when available) and it handles it with no problem.Things to know. The thing gets pretty loud when pushing the machine. But it stays pretty cool considering it‚Äôs this thin. There is no webcam, but it does have a finger print sensor for fast log in.Another big con here, because of the shortage of gaming hardware this seller is doing a bit of a price gouge. Msrp on this thing is supposed to be 1800ish. So I‚Äôd wait it out if you wanna buy it for the right price. But if you need something now I highly recommend.

  Oculus does not support this laptop. If you buy this thinking you will be able to play VR games with your Oculus headset, you will be sorely mistaken! I have run into nothing but headaches with this laptop. It even has trouble running certain Ray Tracing software like the Quake 2 RTX demo.

  Overall I'm very satisfied with the product, but there are few but's.- When gaming the laptop microphone becomes totally useless because of the fairly loud fans. All this noise suppression is useless too.- One particular game made the screen go wild with RGB lines. After a certain amount of time. No other game would do so, so i don't know what the problem is. Also this same game works flawlessly on other PC's.- Playing with speakers is almost useless because of the loud fans. Having headphones helps.Other than that i'm very impressed with this beast. Makes gaming very comfortable/portable.

  Quick and to the point. This is not a 4k gaming machine. Expect to hit around 60fps in QHD at ultra high settings in games like ""The Outer Worlds"". The Pantone-compliant QHD display running older titles w/ high frames @ 165Hz still looks great. It isn't going to be a ray-tracing powerhouse but is the best I've seen for this form factor. Research yielded that there is not much difference between RTX 3070 and 3080 at this wattage and form factor, so keep that in mind. The only negative is no webcam. I personally have an external that I use on a monitor and when traveling - but some may not like that. If you can get it for MSRP ~$1799-1859, you won't be disappointed.

  So far this has been a great laptop. I do have a minor complaint about not having the camera installed though, but not a big deal.Overall the overclocking software gives you some flexibility to get higher frames in your games. The ergo-lift is great because it offers much better airflow, not sure why more manufacturers don't do this.The panel is much better than other panels I have used, having 1440P at your fingertips rather than a 1080P made me appreciate this laptop much more.You can upgrade the RAM, though the RAM is soldered you will be able to run dual channel regardless up to 16GB depending on your soldered RAM amount (8 GB soldered and you add a 32GB RAM, you will have 16GB running in dual channel and the rest in single channel).This is a lower wattage card, if I am correct it is 80W with a dynamic boost up to 100W. So, this is a MAX-Q, do not be confused thinking this is a full 3070 card like these manufacturers are abusing the confusion.As of my writing on 3/23/2021 I would not suggest purchasing this laptop for $2500 as posted on Amazon currently, MSRP is $1799, do not pay this premium unless you absolutely need it.

  This laptop is great! I am a competitive gamer and I just got this laptop today and so far I have only been able to play Fortnite! I ran a solid 240 fps the entire time. I would mention that the fan is very loud And the keyboard isn't great. Definitely would recommend an external keyboard and mouse. I am very pleased with the results so far and I am going to update the review whenever I test more games. Discord ran well and audio worked well. It has 4 USB ports that is great. And as I said the only downside is it is fairly loud. You probably want noise canceling headphones and mic. Overall very solid laptop and it performs very well. Side note make sure that you set everything up right because at first I had trouble installing some games. However I restarted my PC and it worked just fine after.

  WARNING!!!! After 3 months the bluetooth completely dies on this laptop! That might not be so bad, but I purchased the extended warranty and accidental damage insurance on this. The support ASUS provides even when you have the warranty is HORRENDOUS! They also use quite a bit of scare tactics in their language. They do not provide packaging to ensure that your laptop is well protected from the moment it leaves your hands till you get it back. They then warn you that physical damage will void the warranty! This is even if you have pictures showing there is no physical damage. So if it is damaged during shipping even if they provide the label, they will not take responsibility. So if FED EX Damages it then they can dishonor the warranty completely. They will not return the original box if you use it to protect the laptop in a shipping box! If you use it, they will charge you more to send it back to you! They also will not send the laptop power cord back without charging you extra unless you are sending it for power issues! This means that even though it is only a 3 month old laptop and I paid to have the extended warranty! I still have to pay out of pocket to purchase the packaging which to try and make sure it survives you do not want to get cheap packing materials! So because their product is defective I am having to spend extra just to ship it to them! They also do not tell you how they ship it back. So I could use nice packing laptop box and material and they might just put it in a box with those cheap air packet bags? I don't know they don't tell you!!!!!Not only do you have to package it yourself to send it for repairs. They use standard ground shipping. Then they take 7-10business days to fix it and standard shipping back. With delays in shipping you can be looking at anywhere from 2-4 weeks without your laptop and that is optimistic estimate. They are even warning that the 7-10Business days for repairs may be delayed because they may have to wait for the part longer! So they really cannot tell us how long it will take!!!! 1 month? 2 months? I understand there will be delays due to the pandemic, but ASUS lack of authorized repair places is terrible! Something you want to keep in mind, especially if the system has a substandard Bluetooth in it that cannot even survive 3 months. Also there have been various issues with Asus bluetooth posted in their forums and online. This is not something most of us think to question or look up when we are buying a laptop. Especially since our family has laptops over 10 years old that NEVER had a bluetooth issue. So this just tells me ASUS is cutting costs by using substandard hardware, then they make it so frustrating to get it repaired even when you have the extended warranty!!!One of their managers even authorized to expedite the shipping for me. This was over the phone and I asked him if their would be a recording of the conversation since their live chat was taking forever and I would not have a written transcript. He assured me it would be and gave me the reference number for the case. Yet when I used that case number to get my RMA, it would only issue a label for standard shipping!!!! So I had to wait an hour again to get someone on live chat this time and they tell me there is nothing documented that the manager authorized expedited shipping. I had to remind the agent that it was over the phone and the documentation is a recording! So if that manager did not put his authorization in the notes, that is just something else they are shady about. Now I have to wait 48 hours for that agent to escalate it about the expedited shipping so they can listen to the recording!Oh and they have the whole condescending ""I apologize for the troubles you have had"" line down pat. Yet that line means nothing when they do not do anything to make sure and take care of a customers concerns!!!When we purchase an extended warranty and especially when we have to call on it when the laptop is only 3 months old, Then they should be bending over backwards to make sure we have a smooth transition. From sending us a laptop shipping box with the appropriate packing foam to protect it. With overnight shipping or at least guaranteed 2-3 day. If that means it costs them more during this time of the pandemic to make sure their packages get priority, then that is a cost that this company should be absorbing!! Especially since if their bluetooth did not fail after 3 months then they would not have to worry about these costs for repairs!I believe in extended Warranties and accidental protections. But I also believe a good product should NEVER need us to use them. They should be for piece of mind in the unlikely event. Certainly do not expect to need to use it 3 months after I buy the product!!!!!!! Given that, ASUS should be bending over backwards. They should infact have just offered to send me a new laptop with a shipping package to send the old laptop back to them. Then they could refurbish and resell the old one and I would have a working one straight away with no interruption in my use of a laptop.Amazon does that! I had to return a tablet to them under warranty cause I dropped it and the screen broke. Since I purchased the accidental protection plan, they sent me a brand new tablet and the packing material I needed to send the old one back. They would only charge me if they did not receive the old one back. Yet Asus it is like fighting tooth and nail and even though I told them I have had a bad experience with shipping delicate items for repair in the past, they could care less about making their customers feel assured they will take care of everything!Buy from a company that actually takes care of you! Especially when you invest in their extended warranties!! Those warranties should be cash cows for the companies just so they can take that special care of the rare times when someone may need it. They should not be a cash cow for them then to make it as difficult as possible for them to honor it and find every way to weasel out of it all while making sure that their customer is without access to their product for weeks if not months at this time!!!!!!

  ¬†***UPDATE****9/29/2020 After very light use, this laptop has seized all operation of Windows elements. Can‚Äôt boot repair, can‚Äôt system restore, can‚Äôt use the start button, can‚Äôt use windows explorer, etc. Only used to make beats and other music production as a mobile option.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(Music producer here). Great laptop so far. Battery life was about 4 1/2 hours of just installing software and plugins. Does get a bit hot even just installing things. Might need a cooling pad tbh. So 4 stars for that.Handles Omnisphere very well, (huge synth plugin for music production). Fans aren‚Äôt that loud, more of a soft ‚Äúshhh‚Äù sound. Quieter than expected. Cools itself off pretty quick.. Nothing comparable to an old ps4 or something alike. ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è Boots up very fast. VERY light. Love the metallic shell on the screen half of the laptop. Keyboard half is mostly plastic, I assume so it doesn‚Äôt conduct so much heat.240hz is really smooth. Very happy with the display. Brightness is great, doesn‚Äôt seem dull around sunlight or well lit rooms. Hated that about my HP Omen. Keyboard feels nicer than most laptops. Even though I‚Äôm a mouse guy, the trackpad is super smooth and responsive. Solid click, laptop doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúhallow‚Äù and warping feeling other cheaper models do when you press down on the keys or pad. Very sturdy.Speakers were surprising, there‚Äôs actually bass?? Doesn‚Äôt get as loud as a MacBook, but still clear and fuller sounding for a pc laptop. DEFINITELY the best laptop speakers I‚Äôve owned.All in all so far I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the $1800 w/ tax.. Will be doing some moderate gaming on trips and probably update this review then.

  It handles any game I through at it at max settings.  Overall I'm VERY impressed!  I upgraded it with a 2tb Seagate Firecuda SSHD and it's just the laptop of my dreams.  Besides the glitches with windows (no fault of Asus) it's perfect!  I wish I would've waited just a bit longer for the RTX Supers for mobile to be released, but I'm so happy with this purchase anyway.  I still would've chosen Asus.Thermals:The fans are appropriately loud for the power that you get.  The cooling solution is very good!  I'm incredibly impressed by the fact that it doesn't get hot to the touch, just warm!  Where you sit your palm stays cold!My MSI Ge62 Apache Pro 2qf had horrible thermals despite also having two fans.  This laptop does have one additional radiator, and the 2070 is more efficient than the 970m though, so that plays into the incredibly good thermal dissipation.Sturdiness:It feels premium, that sums it up.  You get what you pay for with Asus.  A $2k laptop should feel the part, and it really does!  The RGB sorta shows it too!  If you're a shower, this pretty much presents itself!  When you open it up, the textured aluminum deck will impress you.  That isn't painted or dipped, it's actually textured to achieve the carbon fiber look!  It's the little things that are getting me on this thing, as all the important things are pretty much as close to perfect as something like this could come.Sound:For a laptop of this size, sound is top notch!  Bass is incredible and It's hard to believe it comes out of such a small body.Display:This 240Hz IPS panel is just amazing!  It looks higher res than 1080p to me and I'm not sure why.  I'm coming from a TN 60Hz panel, so maybe that's it?  Anyway, color reproduion is great and results in a beautiful visual presentation.  The fluid motion of everything thanks to the 240Hz refresh rate is just eye candy.  Personally, I see the difference.I have also proven that this panel is truely refreshing as 240Hz.  TestUFO.com will be able to show you the difference between 60, 120, and 240 Hz.  While it doesn't stick out, 240Hz is noticeably better here.The only negative of this panel is the max display brightness.  It's a little bit hard to see in the daylight, but who will be taking their laptop outside in the middle of the day?Issues:This only issue I've had are either petty, or not Asus's fault.-  The keystone keychain holder was torn a bit (not important at all for me)-  Updating the KB firmware was a little janky.-  RGB software is also rather janky.  It works, but doesn't feel ""complete.""UPDATE (6/23/2020):Unfortunately, there is only one USB host controller for all ports.  There is no internal host controller for non-user devices.  Everything is shared on one chip.  A three camera setup for the Oculus CV1 is very difficult to get working.  Usually, two cameras will default to USB 2.0 because of bandwidth issues.  It's a shame this wasn't taken into account, but overall it's still a good laptop.

  I ordered two of these laptops in March as an upgrade for our old ASUS ROGs. At first, these seemed great - performed well enough, great screen, graphics, and frame rates. The fans are quite noisy, but I figured it was necessary considering the graphics card.Within a few days, my spouse began getting the infamous ‚Äúblue screens of death‚Äù and the machine would only boot to the BIOS. He eventually got it running again, but this has been a constant issue. Mine also began experiencing the same problem - I regularly monitor my core temps during multiple activities and while idle, and they are within a good range. Really, all we do is watch Twitch and play World of Warcraft. We don‚Äôt even keep the graphics settings on maximum, the machines are kept elevated with good air flow at all times, and we don‚Äôt have much installed on them.Now in May, both machines are unable to boot, indicating there are no bootable devices. We contacted ASUS and they stated we would either need to purchase a recovery drive or send the laptops back for repairs with an unknown completion date.I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the RTX 2070 being poorly designed for a laptop or what, but this model has been nothing but a constant headache. I would definitely NOT recommend someone purchase this if they are on the fence.

No thanks‚Ä¶ Amazon was there TO rescue not only Amazon is picking up the unit but also sent me the replacement ..5 stars to Amazon and zero stars to ASUS ‚Ä¶so if you encounter the same error ‚Ä¶explain to  Amazon and get your replacement from Amazon DON‚ÄôT EVEN BOTHER to contact ASUS tech support they are answering all questions here on amazon but they have different face when you contact them and tell them your laptop is faulty what a shame ..i am giving 5 STARS to Amazon for their help and support that is why Amazon is becoming king in the market ASUS should learn the meanings of customer /tech support service from Amazon ....

  This is a phenomenally designed laptop with a very limited number of flaws so far in 3 days of professional use. First, the battery life under standard usage (video streaming + web + office files) has been in the 4-5 hour range with intermediate to high screen brightness. The laptop is continuously silent. The dual screen works flawlessly at first initiation of Windows with no additional input/installation required. Setting up a hotkey to auto-load preset applications was simple and self-explanatory, and this function works flawlessly (this is what I show people when bragging about the laptop). The secondary screen, like the primary screen, is touch responsive and works well the the bundled Asus pen or by finger touch.  The keyboard is beautifully responsive and pleasant to use (much more so than my previous 3 macbooks), and I have found no need to use the wrist rest. The offset touchpad works well if you are right-handed, but the responsiveness to the touchpad is slightly worse than a macbook so far (I find myself having to repeat movements to scroll through webpages- not often- but noticeably more than with a macbook), although the settings for this could be optimized better within Windows (sensitivity). The screen resolution is phenomenal and to my eye is at least as good as a retina display. The secondary screen is matte but is quite functional- I am using 1/2 of the secondary screen for email (which I receive constantly) and the other half for webpages vs. word documents, with the primary screen for my primary job occupation including  image analysis. The computer has benchmarked within expectation, and to improve battery life, uses an integrated processor GPU instead of the 2060 for routine applications (I am unsure if the 2060 is only active when the battery is plugged in, or if it kicks in for certain applications- perhaps someone else could specify). The M.2 SSD is a 1TB Samsung MZVLB1T0HALR which has benchmarked as expected. 16Gb ram are clocked at 2667 MHz. The machine is a portable workhorse, comfortable but on the high end weight of what you would want to walk around with for a long period, and can handle anything you would throw at it. Having the extra screen real estate has already made a difference in my specific workflow, and the dual screen setup has been implemented flawlessly. I will say that old programs (old versions of Citrix) that do not have DPI correction for dual monitors (rare nowadays) may have an issue with the dual screen setup, but this would be true for a desktop also and unlikely to affect your usage. Evening sitting recumbent with a 20-30 degree angle on the secondary screen, the font is quite visible.I highly recommend this laptop and expect it will be very popular for busy professionals who do a lot of multitasking and are required to respond to many things in the moment- or who like to utilize a quick glance instead of flipping back and forth amongst screens- or any other possible usages!

  I've waited for months for this computer to be released. It was worth the wait. I'm glad I purchased the i7. The features of the i9 computer are limited and not worth the extra $500 especially since a 16gb RAM for this one is more than fine for me. It is a great computer. The screen is awesome!!! The dual screens makes multitasking easy. The keyboard to my surprise feels great. I have not attached the palm rest. A system tutorial automatically populates for tips on how to use the screenpad. The computer feels sturdy and should last a long time.

  If you're thinking about buying this it's a very good idea, AMD / Ryzen new 5000 chip was actually beating Intel right now. Which is actually amazing.Graphics is using an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card, which is one of the best graphics card as a date and really hard to get your hands on right now, an example of how good the graphics card is I'm I have a 47-in 4K TV that I'm playing cyberpunk 2077 on at high graphics with the resolution of about 3090 / 2600 (something like that) with a zoom of 150% on the external TV. What makes this even more amazing is this graphics card and processor has the ability to actually enjoy cyberpunk 2077 with less delay and load time of zone (which is the main problem of that game, yes this PC has the ability to enjoy that game at this price point which is pretty amazing).RAM - 16 gigs (but it's actually 2x 8gigs of RAM) which actually makes the RAM faster on AMD processor, because AMD has 8 corse in this particular processor which can evenly divide the cores on two differentv team slots that divides the memory workload evenly (for more RAM efficiency )I'm wondering if I can expand the ram to two 16 gigs making it into a 32 chip set (that also runs more efficiently do to the design of the PC)Battery - is actually huge but still dies pretty quickly do to the power this thing gives off (like it only last about 2 - 3 hours)Dose it make me mad? Nahhhh this PC is only 5 pounds which is incredible, but still it charges full in one hour (always unplug the battery when it's full to reduce heat on mother board)Cool duel screen ofc, but the small screen is the only touch screen (which is kind of stupid/ but whateverSo far on certain titles of managed to get between 200 FPS and 250 FPS on certain games titles (graphics on medium of course for high frame rate titles), I may be able to do more I'll update this review (screen supports 300hz)I generally don't waste my time with reviews but it's that awesome so yeah.If you're thinking about getting it just buy it, it's actually really good, also looks like most parts are easy to upgrade.

  This laptop is a major upgrade from my macbook and it runs everything smoothly! Graphics are spectacular and even with this version being the lesser of the 3, it still lives up to it's expectation and I would say is on par with them in terms of power. The second screen is sooo useful, it helps having another screen while on the go and I use it for a variety of things such as writing, watching videos, editing, or even playing low maintenance games on it. Only con I have is that the fans does seem to run fast and hot when doing excessive HD gaming but that's expected with a gaming laptop anyways. A helpful thing ASUS did is on their app they have it so that you can set your battery to only charge a certain amount to extend its battery life. I currently only have mine charge up to 60% as I'm usually at home on my desk.Overall a great laptop with the ability to even go on par or beyond gaming PCs.

  I bought this computer back in August but I had to return it even before I open the box.Mainly, I wanted a good computer that can handle the workload of Photoshop and Illustrator and some image processing without having to go $500 more for a MacBook Pro.Then, I repurchased it two weeks ago and it just got here and so far here‚Äôs what I like and what I don‚Äôt:Pro:Well, the design is sleek and beautiful unlike the first gen of STRIX, the computer is very solid, barely noticed any flex whatsoever.The keyboard is nice, the RGB light is controllable, and it has a soothing feels to it.Track pad is probably one the best I have ever tried.Performance-wise the computer is a beast from booting to using some softwares like Adobe Lightroom for heavy image processing.Finally the cherry on top, THE SCREEN, OH MY GOD, I have never fell in love with a laptop screen much like this one, I used a MacBook briefly and this screen is right up there with Apple screen.Speaker are good, not a very high end but it‚Äôs good.So far I didn‚Äôt notice any thermal activity on the computer.Cons:The Fans and probably so far the only downside to this computer, they do run loud and it‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me since I‚Äôm not gaming a lot anyways.Overall, it‚Äôs good computer and I love it and I would recommend it to a friend.I will update after trying Photoshop and/or some game just to see how it handles the load.************* UPDATE **************I have been using the computer for a month now and some issues have surfaced.The right side speaker started to make that annoying crackling sound and after that it stopped working. Honestly not the worst thing that could happen. I‚Äôm happy with one good speaker than having two and one of em is crackling.The second issue is that the computer started crashing at least once a day.I really hope ASUS sees this because I didn‚Äôt spend my hard earned money to get faulty products.

  edit update 10.05.2018LOL.... I received a message from ASUS as follows:""Thank you for contacting ASUS Product Support, my name is Huit B. I am sorry that you di not receive a call of duty black ops 4 activation code for you unit. I understand how frustrating that can be, but I can definitely help in resolving this issue for you.I have checked on this matter for you. I regret to inform you however that your device would not qualify for the promotion. This is because you did not purchase the device from one of our participating resellers in this promotion. Here is a list of all of the participating resellers:WoW....  Thank you Huit B!  I've always wanted to be the lucky guy who was able to file the initial claim for a class action lawsuit. I never thought, though, it would be against Amazon and Asus for false and misleading advertising.....Now if I could only find a good class action lawyer......So beware all Asus Buyers from Amazon.  You are an undesirable, nay a deplorable, in the eyes of Asus, even though their ad copy says the exact opposite.Wish me luck as I request a refund from Amazon for the dollar amount of the ""non qualified"" purchase of the game....I purchased this for video editing and just set it up for the first time last night.  First impressions are good.  As others discuss, the fans are loud, but that has to do with the temps generated by the chips. For daily use, ASUS says you can dial down the fan, and I did do so, and it did make a difference.Set up was easy, as it was windows standard home.  I'll update the review once I edit a few demanding videos to get a feel for it's horsepower performance.Since I am not a gamer, I was intrigued by the free game the description above says comes with the product , ""Activision Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 game codes - Offer valid 09/10/18‚Äì12/31/18, while supplies last. Go to the official ASUS site for FAQs, full terms and conditions, and to verify purchase for redemption. See Product Description for additional information.""Alas, it wasn't preloaded.  Nor was there any info in the box.  Exploring the ASUS website, it says that all laptops are eligible for the free game, but a code is needed to download the game.  Unfortunately, no code was in the box(implied on the website), nor was the promised ""asus registration app WITH CODE"" launched after windows did its multiple update thing (also implied somewhere on the website).  I emailed a support ticket to customer service, with the auto AI saying a reply within 48 hours should be expected.So NEVER purchase this for a christmas morning surprise for your gamer kid, without a backup plan.So if you really want Call of Duty, don't expect it with purchase, or you'll be frustrated and disappointed.

  ¬†The thing was a beast and it was built beautifully. A lot of titles hit the 144fps mark. The problem is whenever you tilted it forward, it would click. I thought it was a HDD failure, but it wasn't. The right fan was failing. For $2,000 dollars that is unacceptable considering the GTX 1070 and i7 8750H NEED proper cooling. I returned this item for a full refund. I'd buy another one but, as a college student, I can't risk having this thing failing me when I'm away from home. My case might be a rare one, but I can't take that risk.

  ¬†Used for gaming on the go. Great for COD BO4. However it gets pretty loud so wea ear phones and prop the laptop up to get air flow to the machine. Ran 85 degrees Celsius during gameplay (Black ops 4). The only issue is one of the fans is clicking. Possibly a loose bearing or smacking against a wire in the case. I uploaded a video with the sound.New update: Laptop died June 12th 2019 which is within warranty. I started up world of warcraft just after an Nvidia update and the laptop shut off on its own like someone flipped a light switch. No battery power or LED's to show that its charging or plugged in. Complete power loss. Troubleshooted with Asus tech support which got nowhere. Definitely a power supply issue. Currently being RMA'd.

  EDIT: To sum up, gaming wise, if this were a console, one gets the graphics performance of (maybe) the Xbox One S with (about) CPU of the new Xbox Series X. Its fine for this generation of games and maybe Cyberpunk 2077 since this machine runs Death Stranding (maxing out turbo mode), the fan system seems okay (but I prop it up), but its not 10 years fine. SO, I do feel fickle buying this. It does make for a laptop that will blast through anything as a daily driver (student/business/home). It also looks great, especially when closed--its very stealth--and real-aluminum lid beats the rest.The Geeky Details...The Ryzen 7 4800HS is a great processor. It tests up against modern desktop CPUs, which I haven't seen in laptop computing at this price. But its nothing without the operating system and software that can utilize this power. That being said, the market and software are not ready for this processor yet. WIndows doesn't seem to like it, either. Asus is constantly updating little fixes, but this system was definitely hacked together seeing how fragmented all the kernel components seem. The Armoury Crate controls the ""overclocking"" or just a ""turbo"" power mode with limited customization, and though I don't entirely trust it--I does function as a gateway from desktop to bios-level system alteration. They put in a 1650 instead of the 1660i so they could save x amount of dollars per unit--the 1650 is maxed out and teeters on the edge of games such as Death Stranding.

And will send me one ""comparable"" to this model. Called on 3/14 asking where my unit I sent them is since it was delivered and signed for. Asked them for my unit back so I can return it.

  After spending many years with an old Alienware 17, I really needed an upgrade but wanted to wait until there was a real performance improvement over the current gen processors and graphics cards. I was very impressed with the Ryzen processor in the Zephyrus G14 last year and so was aiming to get a laptop with an AMD processor this time round. Initially my main options were the 2021 Zephyrus G15 and the 2021 Strix G15 both with the RTX 3070. Having tried the Zephyrus I found that I did not appreciate the extremely loud fans under load and the fact that its unique design with the ergo-lift hinge meant that all the hot exhaust was blown right below the display panel. While I'm sure that ASUS has done their due diligence in making sure that it did not adversely affect the life of the display, I found myself uncomfortable with it. Moving on to the Strix, it wasn't due to launch until April. Thus when I saw the SCAR 15 available on Amazon, I Immediately placed my order.In the two days I've had it, I've found myself falling in love with it. Don't get me wrong, it does have it's flaws; It has no webcam (which is an unacceptable omission for most, especially in the pandemic era of constant video conferencing), the Aesthetic is not exactly what one would call subtle ( especially not compared to the sleeper gaming laptops available in the Zephyrus lineup) and it weighs more than all its thin and light competition.These flaws however weren't much of a compromise at all for me;I use an external webcam anyways (which offers much better quality than most any laptop webcam) so the lack of an inbuilt option did not bother me at all.I love the gamer aesthetic with the RGB backlit keyboard, lightbar underlighting the chassis and the keyboard deck being transparent on one half, allowing you to catch a glimpse of the internals. With all the lighting turned off however, it would drastically decrease the amount of interest the laptop garners.And finally on to its size and weight, coming from an era when gaming laptops used to be genuinely desktop replacements and moving them a truly herculean task, the SCAR 15 is quite a flyweight in comparison. Even in comparison with the Zephyrus G15, considered one of the best thin and lights, the SCAR 15 is less than a pound heavier. This additional mass also allows it to run the full power RTX 3070 mobile rather than the low power available on thinner laptops.In conclusion, If you'd like a gaming laptop with great performance and enjoy the gamer aesthetic, This if definitely the laptop for you.If you do feel like you can wait and mind paying extra for the bells and whistles such as the opto-mechanical keyboard, you might be better served waiting for the STRIX G15 to launch.As for me, I'm going to go enjoy my wonderful new laptop!

  Pro:- Top notch for gaming performance. I can play cyberpunk and RDR2 both at max settings with plenty of graphics memory to spare. Can also play Guild Wars 2 in large crowds with no perf hits so it works well for MMOs as well.- If you like blinky rgb lights like I do, it can‚Äôt really be beaten in that department- light and portable, but also feels really durable. I have not put that to the test though.- doesn‚Äôt get too hot to actually use on your lap while gaming- touchpad turning into a numpad is a great idea and very functionalSubjective:- No webcam. This is almost a con, but since some people straight up cover their cameras with tape, I guess it‚Äôs a plus for them.- Mechanical keyboard. Thing is loud. I imagine I may annoy my wife, and if you were going to go write your novel in a Starbucks or whatever, you might get some looks. It feels great though, assuming you like the feel of a mechanical keyboard.Con:- lack of card reader. I‚Äôd much rather have that than the keystone thing, even though the hardware based shadowdrive is kind of cool.- port layout isn‚Äôt to my liking. A lot of the ports are on the back instead of sides where I‚Äôd prefer them.- thing is terrifyingly loud when you turn it on (the ROG logo screen)- Fans get jet engine loud when playing graphics intensive games. Maybe not more than normal gaming laptops but still noticeable.

  I was absolutely thrilled to get the laptop. Great specs, two slots of unsoldered RAM, and 3070 MAX-P. I don't know how to else to express this, but I am absolutely shocked by the quality control from Asus. I was at least expecting a boot with an error or something, but no boot out of the box? Tried it with both the power brick that came with it and a 100W usb-c charger. Nothing. Fans don't even come on.I've never had that happen to me and I've owned more than 5-6 laptops. It's increasingly frustrating with the lack of product available out there.

  pros and problems at the bottomI have had this for 2 days and they asked me to submit a review, so I will. I have not been able to test the battery life yet, the screens are vivid and vibrant AF, very beautiful. The tech between the touchscreens is good but not perfect. it works well and feels very natural comfortable to use with the wristwrest, without it I would recommend a keyboard. the bottom screen can be a bit hard to read smaller text unless you lean in or loom over, but its very useful for email clients, chat clients, toolbars, basically  anything productivitywise. makes programming on a laptop feel so much better! I have not been able to test the touch functionality, the pen that came with has problems. I am awaiting technical support on that, and the seller chose to send a request for review in responce instead. the speakers are a bit weak, their placement makes them harder to hear and just slightly muffled.  They are placed in the hinge nook, and if you see how it opens to act as a stand, well, yeah, inside that little hole area. The camera is improperly installed, but in a harmless way. the drivers dont work with discord correctly.pros:- beautiful screens- great bottom screen productivity- feels great to use, very comfortable keyboard and great use of spaceproblems:- speakers are weak and slightly muffled due to placement- camera installed slightly wrong, though it works fine- power button also slightly tiled, I cant tell if it is improper installation or damage, though it works fine- stylus has a manufacturing defect, making it unusable. waiting on seller to help.For the price I paid, the noticeable manufacturing defects are a problem, especially because it makes me worry what else might be wrong underneath the hood. thank god for warranties.UPDATE: asus customer support lied the first time I talked to them, the only way to fix the 50$ stylus is to return the laptop as well. They take forever to respond, and dont give straight answers or acknowledge mistakes, making the conversation feel circular when trying to figure out what the truth is.

  I'm going to give you my personal experience and a fine detailed review on this laptop.For starters, the ZenBook laptop is a mobile power work station, and demands to be place on a hard surface. The laptop will push upwards to tilt the screen, and its main in-take air vents are located on the bottom.  You don't want to place this computer on your lap because of its unique design.  This computer is fast. Once I manage to access my WiFi I was able to blow past those Windows update within 30 minutes. I went ahead and download the full Abode suite with 25 minutes! And the programs load up within 4 seconds and keep performing without latency.  I did a few Blender demo renders. One was the BWM file. It took me 1 minute and 28 seconds to render in full HD. The computer fans were very quite while rendering, and I can't hear them during normal computer usages, like surfing the web or watching YouTube videos.The screen is an 15 inch OLED. With my copy I can't see anything other than a beautiful screen. Looks like a window images are so clear. The bottom has a mat finish to cut down on the top screen glare. I should mention that the top screen has a glossy finish that will reflect anything bright in the room, but the screen is bright enough to drown out those distraction. Just don't have any bright lights right behind you if that gloss bothers you.I can watch a YouTube tutorial with the second screen while following along with the main screen.You can do a lot of multitasking by using the second screen, and the controls work very will with me. If you get this laptop make sure to update all of the software that comes with it.I haven't tested any games on the ZenBook but since this laptop is only for work I don't think I will ever put anything that will push this baby to the max. But from what I know after doing some research is that you could defiantly play any game no matter how demanding the hardware requirement. However, there is a catch. You can only really enjoy high frame rates in full HD, not in 4K. For example, most FPS games can get somewhere in the 80 to 100 fps in full Hd but in 4K you might get 25 or 30 fps. Like I said, I haven't tested this computer on any of my own games, but I am just giving a very general look of what this laptop could do for gaming... You will just have to google up that information.Let me sum up my experience in a quick pros to cons.Pros: Great for content creations while being mobile.Super fast without lag. I can boot up into my OS within 6 seconds if I were to turn off security. The face recognition adds maybe 2 seconds, and works flawless.Programs load up fast and stays running fast.Bottom screen is damn useful! And for some reason you need more screen room you could very easily hook up 2 other 4k screen. Just make sure to turn off the bottom screen.The keyboard is actually very nice! It does take a little time to get use to but I'm able to type in everything very fast. With the keys sitting so low to commentate that bottom screen I really don't need to sit up very close to the computer. I can set back farther and very comfortability type.The trackpad is great even though it's on the right side and small. I like it and it works will whenever I'm not doing any hard work. Otherwise, I do use my regular mouse.There are a lot of good shortcuts on the keyboard.The computer comes with a wrist rest and is very useful.Overall laptop has a very good Build quality!!! All of the computers guts are kept inside. Nothing pushing out no defects.Con:The cons are not a big deal and I  can live with them.Web cam sucks! 720 with a low quality laggy picture view. It's do able and I would use it if I was in a pinch, but I have a Canon Dslr that has clean HDMI output, and it works well with this laptop. If you do a lot of zoom or video streaming buy a good web cam or camera.Battery life is very low. 2 to 4 hours unless you cut back a lot of feature. You might get 6 hours at best, but I feel this is leading towards what a desktop can do and the battery is more like something that will allow you to save your work during a power outage.The build quality is great but the side heat exhaust vents are sharp to the touch. I have no problems picking up the computer and carrying it in the hands, but I have seen in other reviews of people cutting themselves by grabbing these vents. It's not a personal problem because I feel careful enough to not get cut by these sharp areas.The lack of USB ports? Not a real problem! Just get a Thunderbolt 3 USB hub. I have one that allows me to connect 3 USB 3.0, 2 different size SD cards, and a HDMI port at the end. And I still have 2 USB 3.1 second gen ports open for my Backup HD and flashdrive.Lastly, I want to finish off by saying, buy in laptop protection plan, make sure you get this laptop under some warranty. I see a lot of reviews of people getting defective copies. I made the decision to buy this laptop because I felt that the odds of me getting a bad product would be slim, but I took no chances. I went with the 4 year plan.Great laptop, once you get

  Status: Returned due to quality controlReason: Touchpad was defective (6/10 properly working) + There was a physical [divot] on the touchpad where I considered to the dead zone. I didn't want to send it out to the manufacturer and have it come back even more beat up from shipping.*** Pros:- 240 Hz screen!!! What is screen tearing? Web browse scrolling has never been so smooth in my entire life.- Games like WoW easily pushed 120 FPS+ but I capped it at 70-80s for cooler fanning and better battery life.- You'll feel like you're on a desktop instead of a laptop when doing your day-to-day things.- The sound system is a beast and the RBG isn't too ""extra"" like I thought it would have been.- Good keyboard travel and response.- You don't feel the hotness of the chassis through your keyboard.- Laptop doesn't feel flimsy one bit.*** Neutral (what was already expected):- Naturally, the laptop is on the heavier side and it's easily noticed when I move my laptop around (a lot).- Fans do get very loud when you game.- Certain Linux distros suck because they don't have compatible fan management and very poor battery management.- O/S boots very fast (1 TB M.2).*** Cons:- The Windows Precision Touchpad with the digital number pad gets accidentally turned on A LOT and that's when my keyboard goes haywire thinking I'm spamming ""44444"" or ""10483333"". I accidentally hit the number pad ""on mode"" so often and it's not that easy to turn off from what I understand. I will never ever get another laptop that has that function ever again.*** Final: There is a dead zone on my specific laptop's touchpad which made me end up returning it.Who even uses the touchpad right? This is a gaming PC so hook up that gaming mouse. Well, what if I'm traveling, on a plane, on my Grandma's couch shopping, etc? It was these exact moments that made me realize if I'm paying so much for a laptop and can't use a touchpad once in a blue moon (because of its defect) then why not just build a gaming PC? I could also get a 700 dollar laptop and deal with some deficiencies but for a $1600+ product, everything should be in working order.

  This thing is a beast but the cooling overall wasn't really optimal. I have had the strix I before and felt that was better quality and designed. This doesn't even have a Webcam sadly. Rtx is nice and all but not too many games out there for it for my taste yet. GTX series are still a better bang for your buck. Wait until they have better 2-4k  OLED panels with 144hz+ then you will see the rtx shine better than 1080p panels.

  I purchased this item new in November 2019, for my nephew as a Christmas gift. Mid March 2020, the computer died after just 3 months of casual use. It would no longer charge or turn on. I called Asus and they honored their warranty and supplied me shipping information to send it back to be repaired. I have no idea what was wrong with it, but today I received it back. I don't know if it is the same item I shipped or if it was replaced or repaired. I really don't have high expectations for it to last. It's difficult to have confidence in a product that broke within 3 months. I'll update this review later.UpdateI found out something needed to be reset on the computer. I know this of no help, because I can't remember what needed to be reset. Apparently, it's something you could fix yourself at home if you know what you are doing. Something to with the motherboard being reset maybe. Anyway, it's been working great since we got it back and no complaints.

  I bought this laptop for multiple uses but one of my concerns was whether or not it would work for VR. It does say ""VR Ready"" but at first glance it doesn't appear to have the appropriate DisplayPort connection to connect a VR device. In the ads for the laptop it says ""USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4 Technology"" so basically I found out that I needed a cheap USB-C to DisplayPort adaptor to plug my Rift S into. It works flawlessly using the adaptor with Oculus and SteamVR.I have ran a few games and simulators on it and it does very well. It also runs video editing and CAD programs without any issues. Best laptop I have ever owned and outperforms my desktop too!It feels very sturdy, keyboard is great, lighting is cool and customizable (you can turn it off too). Sound is also fantastic. The fans can get fairly loud in turbo mode but it isn't that bad.My one complaint is that it dropped in price by $100 4 days after I bought it.....

  As a owner of the previous generation Strix, I really liked how they upped the quality of the build on this laptop. I feel like it's definitely built to last, feels super sturdy while still maintaining surprisingly good weight in a compact-ish size. The battery life is not outstanding, but for gaming laptops this doesn't typically matter anyways. The screen is fantastic and beautiful, great color contrasts and in my opinion the brightness is definitely sufficient. The thermals are good, but it can still get pretty hot (up to 85 degrees celcius I've seen, playing Ark Survival Evolved on max settings with Turbo fan setting). The fans can be very loud, but they're also easily togglable in case the noise is too much. Still can run solid on lower fan settings, it just gets a bit warmer.

  Wow, what can I say... let me try to constrain my emotions and keep my ROG fan boy inside my pants for a moment and write an unbiased review to the best of my abilities.1. \\CPU is amazing\\ it blows my dell's i7-7700HQ out of the water. x700HQ has been a staple for years and who wouldve thought 8th gen intel has come so far. it does everything so buttery smooth in windows 10 and 6-cores (12 threads)2. \\GPU is amazing\\This is one of the thinnest laptop if not the thinnest that I have ever seen or used with these type of specs. GTX 1070 max P is definitely a powerful beast. It runs BF1 at max settings at 1080p perfectly fine, with G-Sync turned onI would say at this point, built-in display limited at 1080p is becoming a let downbut matters not, I am going to test the limits of it via a USB-C thunderbolt to DisplayPort cable and hook it up to an AGON AG352UCG6 monitor and run it at 120Hz G-Sync and see how it does at 3440x14403D Mark11 yielded around 22K of scoremost importantly is there is a switch for turning the dedicated graphics off, just using Intel that saves a lot of battery power if I am just doing a presentation on the go, it is nice they've thought of this instead of making a pure gaming machine (no laptop should be so single purposed)3. \\Friggin fast SSD\\I do graphics work and video editing work on this occassionally and it has kept up with loading Premier and transcoding the files very fast, thanks to the graphics card being utilized by Adobe. When transfering the large files, its kept up its paces too although I am not putting the drive to work nearly its advertised limits since I/O is still the limitation. There is a Dell thunderbolt 3 external SSD Drive out, I may buy that and test it outI believe this SSD inside the ASUS is an iteration of the Samsung 970 EVO, definitely one of the fastest out there (except for the Pro)the 1TB hybrid drive is no slouch either, enough to store some of the files (while the rest are on NAS), and hasnt been too much of a bottle beck4. \\Clever chassis design\\The chassis is pretty smart, since it has a piece on the bottom that pops open when I open the lid to a certain degreethis has allowed for cooler air to enter from the bottom and sides, especially useful as a tilt that helps with my typing tooThis is particularly useful too when using on the lap or on the bed where bottom tends to get muffled with blankers or something softwith about an hour of encoding, the cooling setup inside has kept the machine not too noisy, doing its job of efficiently cooling the GPU and CPUthe keyboard area has remained fairly cool, under 45C for most of the time5. \\Decent screen\\Screen and its bezels are the only partial let down of the machinevisually, the quality is great and i havent noticed any blurring or tearing with G-Sync turned oncolor accuracy seems good enough for most graphics work although I still use an external monitor with higher DCI-P3 profile for video editingI havent experienced much input lag or slow response time so things are peachy therebezels though.... they are still large in a day and age where infinite edge displays and super narrow bezels are becoming common on $1300 laptops, yet this $2k machine is still rocking the thick arse bezels... what gives?6. \\Fancy keyboard and lighting\\There is some glow around the laptop and backlit keyboard is pretty colorfulI am not one for the rainbow scheme of color in my gaming laptop so ive set it to just red and dim for nowthere are so many apps and settings that I havent gone deep enough to figure it all out yetand that is one of the problems... too many apps and settings!I suppose I am not geeky enough wanting to tinker with those all the time7. \\Upcoming upgrades\\Seeing how I am running close to the 16GB of RAM, I plan on adding another 16GB soonI opened up the mem bay and it is a good sign that both slots are operable, while only one is occupied by the 1x16GB 2666, I will add another 16GB soonAnother upgrade is I plan on adding a thunderbolt 3 port hub that has more USB ports, displayport out (USB-C alt mode), gigabit ethernethard to find one that exactly matches my need so will need to do a bit more research (watch out for compatibility with 4K monitors)

  RTX 2070 Max Q 15"" inch versionThe design of this laptop is outstanding, a beautiful piece to look at indeed.Display:The first thing i have checked is the display, sadly it does have light bleed but it is very minimal and not noticable at all. Only when you look for it.Performance & Temps:I was easily getting above 144 fps on Fortnite, with the balanced gaming mode with temps reaching at 80C max.From 80 to 120 fps in dota ( high settings ) which reached max temp of 83 to 85 C.Overall this laptop can tackle any game if you will accept the turbo mode fan noise.This laptop have never throttled and the temps were always below 90C, the fan noise is quieter than what I have expected, and if you will wear a gaming headset with closed ear you wont hear it at all.However sometimes you will get some fps fluctuations which can be fixed/minimised with GPU driver updates and using Vulkan support in Dota 2, if you prefer to avoid all that go for the 17 inch version which has G-Sync support.Sound:The sound quality is ok id give it 7/10 its not bad seeing how thin the laptop is.Keyboard:This keyboard is much better than any keyboard i have tried, so comfortable to type on and no spelling mistakes unlike desktop keyboards. And you wont feel any heat which is the best thing about this laptop design.Ports:Sad that there is no thunderbolt 3 port, RJ45, however the laptop wifi card is so good that you don't need a RJ45 port, the connection is tested and theres no packet loss or stutter at all.Battery life:It can be extended easily with power saving mode up to 3 to 4 hours on browsing and normal use. However you will need to carry a charging brick with you everywhere or a 65W power adapter to charge it with USB C.Overall id give this laptop 8.5 out of 10.However If you have the money i recommend buying the 17 inch version just for that G sync panel, other than that this laptop is great and i have no regrets at all.I will post photos later and include further details incase i notice anything.Edit: temps mentioned above are for CPU, GPU temps were mostly below 65 C which is amazing.Edit December 2019:Thanks for the helpful votes!One of the downsides I noticed about this laptop is the storage. Only up to 1TB of PCiE SSD and it is a hassle to install it. There is a video on YouTube on how to open up this laptop which helps. Laptop still running good though.

  Powerful laptop. Runs everything I've thrown at it. Looks great. Lightweight. Very quiet when not under load. If you crank the fans up, expect to hear a jet engine nearby, though!I gave it -1 star because it gets INSANELY hot unless you properly configure it for your games. ThrottleStop is your friend.-1 star because, upon opening this morning... the casing for the hinge seriously just broke off. Nothing of note happened upon opening. I seriously just opened the lid and ""POP"" -- clean break into two difference pieces. It appears as though there was supposed to be some type of metal rod inserted inside of it to better anchor the plastic cap -- but mine doesn't have one. I am now left here debating if I should call them for a replacement due to this -- or simply superglue it back on. In either case, this never should have happened and has really left a bad taste in my mouth for any potential future purchase from ASUS as I continually hear issues about their QC.

  Update: Within the first 3 or 4 month, one of the fan is making noise. The noise sounds like bad bearing or fan blade rubbing on a wire, shaking and tapping could make noise go away. I RMAed it and told asus which fan is making noise and asked for a replacement. When it came back, they replaced my mobo saying not detecting audio device. WTF? Thet's not even the problem. Sure enough, the same fan is still making tons of noise. So I sent it back for fix again and specificly demand replacing the defective fan. This time, it came back stating fan replaced, and now works without noise. I thought I'm done with this nightmare but hell NO. Now, a couple more month later (out of warrenty btw), the same fan noise came back! I don't know if they ever put a new fan in or just dusted the fan and call it a day. Either way, I'm not expecting a 2 grand laptop to sound like a chain saw bacause of a stupid fan. Asus is either sourcing parts from junk yard or lying to customers about repairing. I use this as a desktop which sits on the table 24/7. It couldn't be my misuse and the other fan is working fine all alone the way without making any excesive noise.*Original review below*I want a thin and light but very powerful gaming laptop. So I compared this with Razor Blade and MSI GS65 Stealth. I heard Blade runs too hot and will throttle. GS65 just simply doesn't have the right configuration I want on Amazon. So I end up settled with Zephyrus. Pretty happy with the decision. The placement of the keyboard and wired lifting mechanism all worked out for me. I mainly use it on desk with power plugged in. It's a replacement for desktop but extremely portable; about same weight and dimension as my 2 in 1 Thinkpad.Here are some pros after couple days of using. Very good cooling as the metal frame and fans with the increased air intake all contribute to the cooling. When I play game, I pleasently found out it OC the 2070 maxq all the way above 1600mhz as the spec only stated 1200mhz from Nvidia. The ROG tax does pay off itself and awards me an awesome product. I also like the speaker that's placed on the bazel right below screen firing towards user's face. It really makes the audio a lot louder and more crisp compared to some other designs with speakers on the bottom facing downwards. I'm used to higher resolution such as 14'' 2k and 27'' 4k from my other devises, but the 15.6'' FHD screen here still looks very clear with great color and the thin bazel is quite gorgeous.Now about the cons I found out. Nothing is a dealbreaker tho. It gets quite loud under full load, so does any other brand so it's really not something to criticize about. I just pop in my earphone and it's all good (Yes, it has headphone jack unlike some fancy brand that doesn't LOL). Keyboard could take some time to get used to but works out pretty well if used on a desk. I fell great typing on it and it never gets too warm because it's away from hot components. I do prefer a full fat mechanical keyboard tho. I wish there is thunderbolt 3, but I really don't need (nor afford) an external graphics card that's stronger than 2070. I really want some kind of biomatric authentification for login (either face or fingerprint). This is one thing I feel really lacked in this laptop. (Yes I'm spoiled by my phone and thinkpad that both have fingerprint unlock).Overall performance of this gaming laptop is everything I expected and more. Very happy with the build quality. My friends are so jealous too.

  It is amazing, absolutely the most portable, yet beast of a machine, I have ever owned or even used. The screen looks good, I have been using 144hz screens for years so no change for me. It games and video edits like a champ. I am not  going to go much further into what is good, because 95% of it is outstanding. Here is the few things you should know about before you buy.There is one single M.2 slot....that is it... no 2.5 inch and no 2nd m.2. So you're most likely going to want to buy a 1 or 2TB drive and swap it.8GB of the 16GB ram are Soldered to the MOBO...meaning you can swap the other 8GB stick with a 16GB stick to give you a total of 24GB, but thats it. It will not accept higher than 16GB sticks. Now for gaming, 24GB is more than enough, so again not an issue for me, but for others, who knows.oh and the battery life blows....but its a 6 core i7 and a rtx 2070 in a tiny chassis...what did you expect lolThats it. The rest is near perfection. Just stuff  you should know about before buying. 5/5 easily

  This thing is beautiful, and with powerful hardware this should have been the last laptop I ever needed. It is thin, light, and has surprisingly good battery life for basic tasks. But it is absolutely CRIPPLED by always-on auto-updates.Every Windows and Nvidia update breaks this machine. Updating everything out of the box broke basic functionality like video out, auto-switching between integrated and dedicated GPU, and wifi. Calls to ASUS support ended with ""you have to manually uninstall the drivers, download and install the ones from our site"" and poof everything works great!

  I was very happy with my computer knowing that this would be my first windows ""gaming"" computer after a mac just from playing CS:GO my laptop reached a peak of 97 degrees I decided OK that's not right I left it sit there for 5 hours to cool down than I launch up CS:GO again and from 5 hours ago the game was completely fine 300+ FPS and suddenly I am only getting a max of 90 FPS and playing any other games becomes unplayable. Would not recommend if anyone wants to go through a process of returning their laptop. Asus please reply to this with an email I would like to return this computer.

  This product worked great initially consistently pushing out 90 -144 FPS. After about 4 months there are consistent FPS drops anytime there is interaction with other online players (20-30 FPS) . This has become so consistent that when I play I now have been accustomed to hiding when this happens and wait for the frames to jump back up. If I can't I just die and hope it doesn't persist for that session. This has only worsened with every session. I have reached out to Asus support and they have done all they can do. I have reached out to Amazon and will be charged a 20% restocking fee in order to receive a refund for this.Also, the fan is very loud on this machine as you expect with a gaming laptop, but the odd thing is that if you put your laptop to sleep instead of turning it off, the laptop fans will roar in the middle of the night while closed as if you are playing a game. Not the biggest deal as you just need to shut off the machine, but it is part of what you are buying evidently.

  I have to say, I looked for a lot of laptops before I bought this one. Why did I pick this one?I am a civil engineer which means I need a full keyboard with Numpad. Also, the fan noise on this one is supposed to be lower than the others. Don't forget your performance.Now, I returned it as the performance is terrible. playing Fortnite I would feel there is something wrong with the picture even tho the frame is high! I couldn't figure out why. maybe because there is no G-sync...The keyboard was the deal breaker for me, there is something about the keyboard that would hurt your back and your wrists while typing.fan noise was better than Alienware for sure. performance is pretty good. RGB/fan control software is terrible. you cant set per-key RGB for all the game you have. if you have your fan mood on silent and you start playing, it would cause a huge mess, you should never forget to change it to turbo or performance.

  Worth the price? I'm not sure, but it is certainly an exceptional laptop. The keyboard feels nice, the screen is the best laptop screen I've ever used, vivid, high refresh rate, and the antiglare isn't over the top. The hinges feel solid, the lighting is a nice novelty if you are into it. No webcam(which is a plus imo), and the audio is decent for a laptop. It adequately plays every game I've thrown at it even Red dead redemption 2 with almost all max settings, about 50fps.My only complaints are, the exhaust facing the right hand side, so hot air hits your hand if you are right handed mouse user. Then lastly the volume of the cooling fans. However, there isn't much getting around the fan noise if you want quality cooling, and in turbo mode it stays nice and cool with good clock speeds. For low demand situations silent keeps them pretty tolerable in a work environment.

  Design (5/5): Mechanically, this laptop is beautiful and elegantly designed. The bottom air vent that opens when the screen lid opens which was a pleasant surprise! Something so simple, yet useful. The RGB/AURA lighting works as intended and is a nice, non-ostentatious touch. EXTREMELY thin and light for such a huge powerhouse.Screen (5/5): The screen is bright, crisp, and quick. The 144 Hz. refresh rate and deep black level makes everything look beautiful.GPU (5/5): The RTX 2080 handles everything I can throw at it and just keeps churning, but that's to be expected.Cooling (5/5): Under full load, bench, and stress tests, the LT increases RPM fan speed as needed. Very quiet considering the amount of power it is usingUsefulness (5/5) : Both my GF and I travel and frequently work from home. This LT, in combination with my desktop, allows us to never miss out on productivity and fun. Whether it is gaming, rendering 3D images or any other CAD, it's a seamless transition.I highly recommend!Worthwhile mentions: All of the included ASUS software is extremely easy for the end user to navigate.

  If you want no compromises for gaming (or really and GPU/CPU intensive) task, this one is for you.While still being thin and light, it's easy to carry without breaking the back and still managing to pack a punch.Asus seems to have solved the thermal throttling issue that would plague most other configurations with an i7-8750H and 2080 RTX MaxQ thanks to the unique cooling design that takes in air above and below the laptop surfaces, and ejecting heat to the back and sides.Observation so far (a week into ownership) with regards to power management is that  the 230 watt power brick or the power management system (windows firmware ) maybe inadequate for this particular configuration.  While gaming on 1080p in Ultra settings on BF5 (ray tracing enabled), the battery will discharge below 90% and continue to do so even after quitting all intensive tasks and simply browsing or idling.  The battery only begins to recharge after at least 30 minutes of idle activity.  I do use a USB-c hub and plugging in an additional type C power source rectified the discharge problem.

  Cons: Limited linux support at this time. Which is understandable since it's brand new hardware. I am pretty sure that I could get this working with a little effort. I am even more sure that it'll be supported fully out of the box with popular distros in a few months or less.  I'd have paid a few hundred more for a thunderbolt3 port or two. The USBC ports appear to be just that, USB.  All of my usability complaints are related to windows 10. I am not saying ""Windows sucks"", it just isn't what I am used to.  It does seem to have issues with driver signing and CUDA, which is a PITA but not really the laptop's fault. I just boot w/o driver signing and it works.Pros: Wicked fast. So fast that I really don't care that I am running windows. Hashcat benchmarks at 27G MD5/sec, 8M MD5crypt/sec, and 49G (!) NTLM/sec. that's at 63 deg C. This drives an Oculus Rift with some effort (fans), and I have only wittnessed heat induced framerate drops once, and the system had other apps running alongside the game (Gorn).  I did some research and determined that this is 50% faster than the fastest computer in the world in June of 2001, which drew megawatts of power and filled a computer center. I don't mind the keyboard/trackpad arrangement but I also have used many awful keyboards across my nearly 40 years of using computers.  The same goes for the screen. I see complaints about bleed here and there but, really, this screen is amazing.  After some time getting it setup and getting used to windows I can honestly say that I am about 90% happy with it given what I paid. One more observation. For CUDA workloads this is 50% slower and 15% hotter than a Tesla V100 under real world workloads. It's also 1/4-1/3 cheaper than a V100 and runs right out of the box w/o suffering the indignity of installing the V100 in a suitable computer. I almost want to build a cluster of these laptops for teh lulz.

  ASUS has the worst support, and Microsoft Windows 10 is terrible. I thought that updating to Windows 10 2004 would be a good idea, but that was a bad idea. Now I can not get back to the previous version, and there are a couple of games that can not run on 2004 -- resulting in a blue screen BSOD. I reinstalled Windows 10, using the ""local"" option, so not from the internet, but it's 2004 somehow. There are no options in the settings to roll back and MyAsus also provides no guidance. ASUS support TERRIBLE (and so is Microsoft). Crappy, spending this much money on a laptop that isn't usable.

  I'm not a hardcore gamer but having lived with a Dell E6410 for the last 10 years I knew I wanted to upgrade once that system could no longer even play World of Warships.. So I researched around and decided on this system from Asus.  I do like Asus products to being with, they always seem well made to me.  I decided to go with the RX 2080 GPU so as to get as many years out of this thing going forward as I possibly can, obviously the GPU blows away anything I'm trying to use it for now.  I'm not an expert so I just plugged and played World of Warships with max'ed out settings and was getting 75 fps on average, good enough for me to be impressed.  My only regret is that there wasn't a larger SSD drive configuration with either 1TB or 2TB at the time I bought the laptop, those were not options on the item at the time.

  This is my first impression, will update as I get more time with it.......It just arrived 5 days early and it doesn't disappoint (thank you Amazon).The first thing that struck me was the high quality of both packaging and build. And It's very light in the hand for its screen size.The touch pad is on the right of the keyboard and doubles as the numeric pad. It feels narrow and awkward initially but becomes second nature after an hour or so (i'm right handed). But to be honest, whoever buys a 17"" gaming laptop will definitely be using a mouse with it.I live in a dusty environment that plagued my old ROG G73JH but thankfully this laptop comes with 2 fans equipped with anti-dust technology.  Under load they are audible in a quite room but once the game sound kicks in you won't notice them.The large screen, GPU and G-sync do drain battery life but thankfully Asus added a feature to disable all that at the touch of a button. (noticed many reviewers fail to mention that G-sync drains more battery life when comparing this laptop to a non-G-sync laptop like the MSI GS75 for example).will update tomorrow with  gpu-z and 3dmark scores/screen shots

  My Zephyrus GX701 system came from Mobile Advance with a 1 TB M.2 NVMe SSD with 16 GB RAM. RTX2080 MaxQ with 144hz of sweet G-Sync.

FINGERPRINT MAGNETCooling vs Typing for GAMERS ‚Äì I personally prefer the front keyboard layout rather than the traditional laptop ergonomics, as the purpose of the machine is extreme gaming with the able to quickly TRANSPORT. The perforated top was warm while gaming but did its job in keeping things cool. Asus aura RGB keyboard looks wonderful, although the software is lacking in customization and compatibility with other RGB devices. Chassis RGB lights can be optionally turned off as well. Keyboard feels good for typing, yet again ‚Äì extreme gaming, I use both usb 3.0 interfaces on the right with another keyboard. Track\Num pad (FINGERPRINT MAGNET too) took a short time for me to get acquainted with using it to navigate Windows Pro.Noise ‚Äì The Zephyrus uses the CPU fan mainly, while doing little tasks. Making the Zephyrus sounds and looks like any other Zen design ASUS. However, the two GPU fans kicks in when a game loads up and this thing comes alive. In comparison, this Zephyrus is much quieter than ‚Äúclassical‚Äù gaming laptops of early 2017.Interface ‚Äì Lacking Thunderbolt and RJ45 port. At least there are two u.s.b gen-1 and one u.s.b gen-2.Speakers ‚Äì There laptop speaker.Battery ‚Äì Power brick is 19.5v barrel plug. 3.2 A . Supports USB PD. Disabling the Geforce and using the intel graphics, I could use the Zephyrus to watch YOUTUBE for a bit over 3 hours. However, with GeForce enabled the battery life from a full charge was less than 45 mins of G-SYNC, surfing the web.GAMING ‚ÄìOn this 17‚Äù (1920 X 1080) METRO EXODUS played butter smooth with all settings maxed out, including the dreaded FPS killer DLSS and RTX.

  If you add more memory to this laptop (16GB  module or higher), memory will run in single channel mode.  This may impact gaming frame rates in certain titles.

  The day I received this beast of a machine was probably the best of my life. This was the first steps into great graphics, speedy response times, and ultimate gaming heaven for me when dealing with laptops. Personally, I've built my own custom rigs and had full blown setups with 3 monitors having high refresh rates, latest and greatest in graphics, and all the bang for your buck. HOWEVER! I joined the military and had to get rid of it all but I was in the market for something powerful but portable. After many hours of careful consideration from credible sources and great videos (Shoutout to LTT for the best review), I came across this beauty! Now, I've had a day to get used to the machine and set it up just the way I like it and without a shadow of doubt, this thing is as close to a full blown tower setup as you'll get. The smooth monitor, best in graphics for laptops, easy gliding keyboard, and software that help enhance the over all experience when using this beauty.

  Great laptop! Very fast and looks fantastic. Man, what a beast. However, it appears the Display and G-SYNC options are missing even though this supports G-SYNC. There is even an nVidia G-SYNC sticker on the lower-left corner of the screen.Any ideas as to why this is happening? I have tried new and old drivers from the ASUS website as well as the nVidia site.UPDATE: I have figured it out.

  I have worked in technology for 30 years, and decided to research and look for a laptop that would satisfy my needs while traveling for a while. I basically have two needs: 1) I wanted a gaming laptop to play my RTS games whenever I got board, and 2) a good editing laptop for my dji drone videos and photography editing using Adobe Premier, Photoshop and other of their products. Both requirements are a laptops worst nightmare. The CPU requirements for intense video require power, and generate intense heat. The worst thing for a laptop. I researched and bought the ROG because they addressed both issues really well. The opening of the bottom panel exposing the internal board allows for heat dispersion and the  GeForce RTX 2080 performs above my expectations. The battery lasts plenty long if not gaming, but adequate under intense loads. This was to be expected, but the unit remains warm, never hot under extreme loads while rendering my videos and gaming.There were many other well thought out design features and software that surprised me like the internet mobile hotspot feature and others. The design is incredible and I love the keyboard lighting. This was actually more useful than I thought it would be, and not just for looks.Over all, after a lot of research and finally getting to use the laptop, it actually exceeded my expectations and I am relieved that I made the right choice. While expensive, it should last me a while, and I would buy it again. It is the perfect size (I prefer the 15"" not 17""), good weight, good material and performs extremely well.Contrary to some reviews, I love the touchpad on the right side. I am not left handed, so it is out of my way while I type and in a very convenient place for my right hand in case I need it. I love the fact that they moved the keypad to the front so that my palms are not on the hot laptop surface.Very happy with the purchase.

  It took a week for me to decide which laptop to choose. I was between MSI, Razer, Asus TUF, Zenbook and ROG. I picked this one.My old laptop had died, it was still fixable but I was due for an upgrade so I got this one. First of all, let me tell you I'm not a fan of small laptops but this one blew my mind. Small, portable and great craftsmanship. It doesn't feel uncomfortable and the keyboard, while taking time to get used to, I found out that it's way more comfortable than most keyboards.As for performance wise... Heck, it is amazing.You can use Cyberlink Studios like a charm and play most if not all current modern games in 60fps and old ones up to 144fps and I was surprised. I never knew that was possible (144fps). Coming from an 970M and 30fps, this was like heaven. The quality and the performance makes this laptop a tremendous buy.The only issue I have with this is the fan. And it's not even an issue, but more of a warning.The cooling is on point but, a disclaimer has to be made, if you're playing in a place with a hot climate, please do make sure to have an a/c nearby otherwise, this laptop will reach temperatures up to 90 Celsius (if not more) under heavy loads/intense gaming. This is something worth mentioning just in case you're in a house with no a/c and it's boiling hot during the summer. For all normal features, not cpu or gpu intensive, this laptop will breeze right through it.Camera quality? It's okay. Not the feature I was looking for, nor a fan of.All in all, a really great laptop. If any issues arises, I will make sure to update this later on.

  This is a great laptop for gaming and that's what it is intended for. This laptop also does a great job doubling for productivity. I do photography in spare time and it is a breeze with photo editing software. The battery is unpleasing but that is to be expected with gaming Laptops. Additionally they keyboard takes some gettingbuse to. The keyboard being located at the bottom of the laptop takes getting use to when in use on the lap however using the keyboard on a desk is easier to do.

  Excellent hardware for gaming but no real number pad. Some game depend on having a real number pad. This is an unnecessary cut on laptops.Battery life gets a boost in points because of being able to charge from an external battery pack. This should be a feature in all laptops.There is NO onboard camera. WHY not? Why would you cut a camera on a laptop. Just because it‚Äôs a gaming laptop doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt use it for business as well. Big fail in my opinion.Other features I would like to see are sd card reader, 4K screen, and Ethernet jack.

  I think it will serve me well in Maya, Photoshop, Premiere, Witcher 3, Deus Ex, Cs GO, Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed, etc. The monitor looks nice and smooth compared to a 60Hz locked pc monitor. I'll need to get a better Pc monitor. My machine doesn't quite clock up to the review samples on youtube, and it does spin up the fans a lot when testing it out in Witcher, but with the turbo and potentially hyper threading turned off, it won't melt. It does sound like rain to me when it is cranking, which is nice. If my souped up Pc decides to die for whatever reason, I will have a back up. I will still need to upgrade the ram and memory for the long haul. I hope this machine will serve me well for years. The lid/screen feels a bit wobbly to touch (compared to ancient thick plastic laptops), but it's not supposed to be constantly twisted. I carefully open it up from the middle and leave it there. I hate laptops in general: overpriced, underperforming, quickly outdated beasts, but I think I'll be happy with this one for a while. Was nice to have on a trip. Would have been very nice to have over the summer on the other side of the world. Handles everything ok. Does what it's supposed to do without crying for mercy. Hasn't pissed me off so far. Used the backpack a couple times to save it from the rain. Not perfect for binders and textbooks with writing utensils, etc., but I wouldn't have to put the laptop in a separate plastic bag not to drown it. The handy zipper on the back is handy. Barely any organization inside. I shoved the power brick in one mesh baggy, pen, tape recorder and flash drive in another, laptop inside its own pouch, and paper with the book messily in the middle. Binder fared better, but would be cumbersome to get out from the back. The pen and flash drive are pretty easy to reach though. Back to the laptop: it's about as close to a perfect machine as I could find at the time of  purchase. Upgradeability of storage and ram, powerful graphics chip, does not look like a Christmas tree on acid with bubble gum stuck all over, does not sound like a lawn mower, is not as thick and heavy as all the textbooks on the first day of the semester after a trip to the bookstore/library; just a neat little black rectangle made of metal. The eye that I don't see would probably bother me if I did see it. It's a horrible logo. The opening bottom is about the same. I did get the mouse cord stuck in it a time or two, and I will have to be watching where I set the thing down, not to eat the blanket or anything else, but I think I can manage that. The obnoxious sound on start up can be turned off. Same can be done with the keyboard rgb. Considering how quickly I start noticing debris on my mechanical keyboard (PC), I have some reservations about the keyboard being potentially problematic to clean up, but that can be said of all laptops. It works. It pleases me.

  I love this laptop. It is slim and reasonably light, yet it still packs insane internals and a second screen! I get around 6 hours of battery life out of it when on the integrated GPU and about 3 when using the dedicated GPU for various lighter tasks. This thing is a productivity beast, and it even has stylus support! The pen for my Surface Pro works just fine, and the eraser on the back even has working functionality (but only the second screen works with touch and the pen). Also, it looks awesome and is a serious gaming beast! I got 50-60 frames (usually closer to 60) in Cyberpunk on ultra with DLSS ray tracing on, which is good enough for me. Even the cooling is as close to perfect as you can get in a laptop. I stayed around 80 degrees Celsius the entire time on performance mode, and the fans didn‚Äôt sound like a jet plane. If I had to complain about one thing, it would the fact that the main screen doesn‚Äôt support touch and stylus. Other than that, it is 100% the best and most powerful laptop I have ever seen, except for maybe the 3080 configuration of this same device. It‚Äôs certainly a desktop replacement in my opinion, and I hope this is what all laptops are moving towards.

  I actually cannot put into words how good this laptop is, but I'm going to try. Just wow.To start off I gave battery life 4 stars, because this laptop uses a LOT of power. I tend to look at this laptop as more of a mobile desktop than anything. It is about 3 hours of life as advertised I believe. This thing surely is a monster though plugged in. I'm in full disbelief that there can be this much power in such a small package. I had the Asus Zenbook Pro Duo prior to this last year at this same time, and while I did love that laptop it was a 4k screen with a 2060 and an i9. The 4k screen made it impossible to do any sort of gaming on it. That as well as the 2060 wasn't powerful enough. The secondary screen also on that model was really hard to view. It just was not practical and I felt myself looking down at it and having to move up. This model has pretty much fixed all the complaints I had and done more.I was really wanting to try Ryzen processors as people had been praising them and I was not disappointed. Between that, the 300hz screen, the 3070 that they put in here and the second screen that pops up it has just blown away all my expectations. This laptop has literally full replaced my desktop as of this week of getting it. It has so many ports on it that I don't even know what to do with them all. I was able to seamlessly easily plug a display port cable to c into this laptop and I am able to game just fine on my monitor I was using for my desktop which this was 280hz and on a lot of titles I have been able to get over 300fps consistently. Overwatch I was able to get 400 if I put it uncapped. As long as you're not playing triple A titles you'll get incredible fps out of this thing. I could go on and on praising this laptop. Asus truly made something incredible.The only cons I've found with this are very few and aren't even big ones. The secondary screen is 60hz. I thought both were 300hz but this isn't an issue since most people will be using the secondary screen for apps like spotify or discord anyways. Another one is subjective, and that's the keyboard. It's some getting used to. I think the actual only legitimate complaint that I've seen others complain about online is that upgrading this was kind of a pain and wasn't as streamlined as advertised. The tool you need to upgrade this is a Torx T5 and PH000 Philips screwdriver which I didn't see mentioned anywhere. There are 14 screws and one is a Philips screwdriver. This would be nice if this was the only part, however once you get inside it's a pain to upgrade or add the SSD. Several people online have mentioned just how difficult it is to unscrew the screws that are in place in the actual laptop (not the outside plate) to slot in the SSD's. I had to use literal pliers to get it as a lot of people said they were stripping the screws inside which I almost did. Luckily after using pliers it was a breeze from there to install the Samsung 980 ssd 2TB I bought for this. Also RAM is pretty much pointless to upgrade on this even though it is advertised to go to 48gb you lose dual channel doing this so it's a worthless upgrade. I wish Asus didn't screw in the SSD screws so tightly, but besides that Asus has simply outdone themselves with this laptop. If you have the money I absolutely recommend buying this. Trust me you won't regret it.

  Beautiful design,  very well built and everything I wanted in a laptop.  The color display is absolutely gorgeous! What makes this laptop stand out is the dual screen which it great for editing content.  It also is very customizable for upgrades which is something that a lot of other laptops don't feature.  The only complaints I have are  the packaging was not ideal from the seller and the timeline for delivery was not what it said originally.  It was a week late and I didn't get a reply from the seller until it was almost delivered.

  This is the 2nd of the zephyrus line up I‚Äôve owned. The first being last years model the GX701GXR. There is a notable improvement in FPS over most of the games I play. Typically I get about 10 FPS more than I did on the old coffee lake model.Improvements I see from this to last years model are as follows.10 FPS gain.20% less time with loud fans.10c cooler CPUBetter aura sync functionality. It barely worked before and often went out or froze.Edit : a couple months in. I‚Äôve noticed in sleep mode it gets very hot. The only fix I‚Äôve found is to either hibernate it or shut it down. Sleep mode keeps it around 80c and sometimes totally trips the thermal throttle and I have to completely shut it down and turn it back on anyway.

  Less than a year ago I bought an ASUS gaming laptop $3000. Quickly its fan made a grinding noise sound so I sent the laptop to ASUS to get fixed. Over 2 months later it came back formatted with the OS installed improperly, oh, and the fan still made the grinding sound. I sent the laptop to a local business that found the problem in 30 minutes. But the laptop no longer functions due to (probably) motherboard problems. So the laptop is back at the ASUS RMA center and has been there for over a month and I am spending $3000+ on a non ASUS desktop after spending that amount less than a year ago. And yes, I asked for a refund or at least a replacement laptop many times. The only thing they repeat is to send it back to the ASUS service center that did not fix the first problem and broke it further.

  This computer is amazing, you have read the specs and the performance backs it up.  It's advertized as a BEAST of a computer and it is, what more can i really say about a computer.  I did find out after purchasing this that Asus only offered the 17 inch model with the i9 processor for a very short time,  so if you can get one, DO IT as these will be rare, i don't want a 15 inch machine.  As far as unique features, i love the color changing backlit keyboard and underglow.

  I've had this laptop for about 4 months now and I feel like I'm a part of the future. Games don't give me trouble anymore and neither does video editing or any hard processing applications. I love having this much computing power in a compact easy to transport device. Only downside is that I pretty much always need to be near an outlet because it does eat battery quickly, but for what I'm doing that's hardly a complaint since outlets are easy to find.

  Well it‚Äôs fast, but wear headphones or the fan noice can be annoying when playing games.  I expected it, they lost a star for making this version harder to add memory or an extra Drive.  Some of the others have a smaller cover that can be removed, but this one you have to take the entire bottom off.  Lazy, this a gamer laptop, so making upgrades more difficult is annoying.Added six months.Still running great, still noisy.  One thing that happened that you need to keep an eye on is the computer started up, but the fans didn't engage.  Only happened once and a restart fixed it, but without the fans it over heated fast, I noticed when my fingers were starting to get hot, since the noise cancelling headphones worked great.  Also the reason I brought up the memory issued  earlier is because other Asus gaming laptops had the easy access panel for memory and I thought the ROG version should have also been designed that way.

  It's a great laptop . But as a laptop you won't get every thing . For starters let's go with cons I might be picky but it's tough loveThe worst laptop battery I have ever seen in my life . I got no idea how laptop is going to be useable after a couple of years and when the battery degrades. Second iam left hand and the track pad is right sided so it's really annoying at frist but if you are a left handed you get used to it . 3rd would be upgradeable basically any possible upgrade is wasteful.  As u only got 1 m.2 slot which you got your preinstalled ssd in and 1 memory slot which is occupied. Lastly there is no ethernet port and no included dongle (with a laptop with that price a 10$ dongle should be included) Let's go to pro holy I do truly love this laptopSo with AC ON  you would get max turbo number on cpu for prolonged time while being under full load( with turbo mode on ). And asus rog turbo boost for gpu makes it soo close to a desktop frequencies .as for performance I did my research ( before buyingit ) and found that asus rog laptops tends to run cooler than other thin gaming laptops while maintaining high frequencies ( while what iam about to say is a fact about all gaming laptops but when u turn turbo mode on its it's like a jet engine)

  This is really not worth price. It has a mind of its own. Your power profiles do not start what you have set. I like to press the power button to shut it down. I‚Äôve had the laptop for a couple months and I‚Äôve had to set this up at least 5 times. Audio is bad sound is ok but it doesn‚Äôt respond to you headset, earbuds or gaming headset.I do play some games and it does very well at it.It's a shame the way they put this together. The large vent on bottom is good unless you want to use your 30‚Äù 4K monitor. If you shut the lid you close the vent. And it needs every bit of that air flow. Full visual settings and the laptop is cooking.And memory why  why why is one stick Soldered to the board. Do you have 8 gigs mounted and one spot with 8 gigs. You really can‚Äôt upgrade because you kill the dual channel.I'm guessing you can change it the socketed 8 gigs with a 16 gig.Well all in all its nice but not at the price.But it's niceIs there better for there money.YesReally really look at all the other optionsBattery sucksThe laptop isn't a laptop lol you would fry your legs doing anything but surfing the internet.It‚Äôs not what you would pull out in a planeIf your looking to be able to take a desktop with you this is it.One more thing it did not come with windows pro.

  Item arrived dead. Gave it 2 hours to charge per Amazon support.  3rd party is unavailable for assistance due to the holiday.3rd party just adds in an extra step  when you have issues...not happy for the money paid.This was RMA'd to Asus and as of 1/13/2020 the status is ""repairing"". As of the date I ordered the product, it will most likely be almost 30 days until the laptop is finished (eta 1/16/2020) and mailed back to me (likely 1/23/2020).Update ! I ended up getting my laptop back a few weeks later. Works as it should.It handles any game I throw at it while on the silent setting. This includes Escape from Tarkov and COD Warzone.The speakers are good.A USB-C - USB and Ethernet dongle makes this laptop complete.The cooling is good and the fans are easy to clean once you remove the bottom cover.

  The GPU in the machine I received is not precisely what's advertised. The page says it comes with an RTX 2080 MaxQ 90w, with a 990-1230mhz clock speed. That's the stock spec for the 90w version of the GPU.What I actually got was a 2080 MaxQ 90w, with a base clock of 735mhz, but under load it goes all the way up to 1985mhz out of the box.  Performance wise, it appears to be between the 90w 2080 MaxQ stock and the full 2080 mobile version. So far, it seems better than I expected.

  After I purchased the ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo Gaming Laptop I was able to intercept strange transmissions which I later discovered were coming from an alien mother ship.  After stumbling across the signal on my spectrum analyzer, which the laptop seamlessly interfaced with, I was able to quickly and efficiently de-interlace the code while playing Solitaire on the highest graphical settings, the cards were so real I thought I was at a high stakes Solitaire game in Las Vegas, best part was there was no lag. After my game was over turned to President Whitmore, who informed me that I was able to bring this super sweet laptop into Area 51. While we were being cleared into the building I thought well what better to kill the time than playing a little Minecraft in the Area 51 lobby. Obviously, due the ultra-dank battery life on this bad boy running out of juice was a non-issue. Once I was there, there was a smaller ship in this subterranean hangar.  I booted up a virtual machine that ran my Kali VM, put this sweet puppy in promiscuous mode, and was able to trace their IP to a server on the mothership. I was then able to upload a virus there that disabled all of their shields so Will Smith could blow them all to heck. President Whitmore thanked me for my service, and told me without my juggernaut-esk awesome laptop the earth would surely be destroyed. And for the price it‚Äôs a steal!

  The ROG Zephyrus Duo is a beast of a laptop.  Overall this laptop delivers performance... as it should at this price point, but the overall design left me wanting more.Let me start with the duo's extra screen.  This is definitely a cool idea and one I thought I would find a useful purpose for, but at the angle the second monitor sits, all I was left with was glare coming from the main laptop monitor.  Unless I was sitting directly over the laptop, the screen was not easily viewable.  I'm not sure how this could be improved though since the angle it sits allows for a clear view of the main laptop screen.  I love the concept and hope that Asus continues to refine this feature.The main issue I had with this laptop is the placement of its power port.  It sits awkwardly towards the front of the laptop on the left-hand side.  This probably won't be such a big deal for most users.  I just found it to be a strange location.  I would rather have the power port towards the rear of the laptop, or on the back if possible.Overall a cool, albeit, quirky laptop design.  Possibly the next gen will address my issues.

  Is it expensive, you bet! Is it awesome, absolutely! Gameplay was great on it, and the angled screen allows us to have a guide up or discord which I am usually in while playing. It's fast, not too hot but I still would put it on a table over your lap, and runs great. 5-hour battery with both monitors on.

My original laptop I got before this was a razer blade 15 pro and that laptop hit the floor my 10th day of owning it... so I came to asus and I dont regret it!Beautiful laptop for multitasking or just for gaming.Pros: beautiful laptop, beautiful 300hz display, outstanding build quality!Cons: Price and mouse pad on the right hand side instead of middle.EDIT: Needing a replacement laptop... not ideal for a engineering student.

  I purchased this for video editing.  The duo screen gives you an extra monitor built in. I plug in external monitor that gives me 3 screens to work with.  I am very disappointed with windows 10 as compared with Windows 7 Pro.I spent weeks removing the excess junk apps from various vendors.  Microsoft has forced settings & apps that you don't need or want but that's my opinion. I sure miss Windows 7.  The only complaint I have regarding this laptop is it has no Home Key, Page Up, Page Down, and End Key.  This is a gaming laptop not a video editing laptop.  You can still work around it with extra key-strokes.  Best feature is duo screen & how the laptop opens up to allow fresh air in.  A first in laptop design.  I like the fact the touchpad serves 2 functions (touchpad & numeric keypad).  I have been using this laptop over 8 hours per day & only the power-supply is slightly warm.  ASUS has a great design with the open keyboard.  Hope future models include a regular keyboard.

  I am particularly not happy that the system becomes too slow, even more than the usual 4G RAM computer, after opting out of the 10S mode.  I could not open two internet tabs at the same time and had to wait endlessly for simple MS document to open. It is simply not acceptable. Highly not recommended, especially if you are looking for moderate system. This is below the bar.

  I purchased this as a gift for my niece who is a high school student and this has worked very well for her for the last couple of months.  For surfing the web using MS Office Suite to do homework, essays, presentations, etc. this is a wonderful little machine. Feels o f very good quality for the price. I don't think you can add more ram but I haven't checked, if you could this would be awesome. So for a basic use like a student for example this laptop is good at this price point.

  TLDR: great screen, zippy enough for basic web browsing, but no expandable storage and odd size/keyboard make it a tablet first and laptop second - it is too much of a direct iPad competitor, which arguably does tablets much better.More detail:Just got my device delivered today, on the 8th.  Unfortunately it has a dead pixel smack in the middle of the screen, so it's not a keeper.  Otherwise, it's a pretty impressive quality build, sturdy and pleasant.As you will see below, the Duet does everything decently well, but ultimately I think users will struggle with how to use it best.  Is it a tablet?  Is it a laptop?  It feels more of a tablet, but if so - why not buy a same-priced lower end iPad which is years ahead on touch sensitivity, responsiveness, and overall user experience?I think Lenovo really missed out by not including a microSD card slot.  I would have loved a slightly more powerful Intel or better MediaTek processor.  A  higher price could have justified those two things.  It's not a device you will want to hook up to a larger monitor and keyboard, and it's too small for real work productivity - it works in a pinch on a flight, but it's no laptop replacement.  And as a tablet, it's kind of a mediocre one.  Let's break it down in detail:THE GOOD:- The screen: it's bright (advertised at 400 nits) and colors look great.  Viewing angles are mediocre, you lose a lot of brightness and contrast by tilting it up/down/left/right, but straight on it looks fantastic.  Asus, if you are listening, please upgrade your mediocre panels (in $1,000 Chromebooks!) to something like this.- Build: solid, very pleasant to hold.  Lenovo got the right balance between size and weight for the tablet.  It even looks like a very high end device, with nice straight edges, rounded corners, and a glass front.  The magnets work well, the backing is very solid, and the folding piece is sprung well, very tight.  The keyboard attaches firmly, no major issues there.- Battery life so far seems to be good.  The nice bright screen drains a bit when playing video content / browsing the web.  On standby it seems to do very well.  Need to do more testing in use, but I'd guess Lenovo's claims of 8 hrs web browsing and 10 hrs video playback are probably about right.  I charged it once on Friday and have been using it all weekend on and off, it's down to about 50% now.THE ""OK"":- Keyboard/trackpad: good inputs, registers all your keystrokes well, and the trackpad (albeit tiny) is smooth and precise.  That said, it's all very small, and requires a solid flat surface to work well (otherwise the hinge wants to fold and make the Duet think it's in tablet mode).  You can't really hold this in your lap, aside from a few keystrokes here and there.  So this isn't a laptop (and Lenovo doesn't market it as such), but a folio keyboard.  My hands are pretty tiny, and I felt cramped on it.... you won't want to write novels on this.  Also, the backing and keyboard together are quite thick and heavy, doubling the weight of the entire device.- Speed: it's a MediaTek CPU, and it performs about as you'd expect.  Games worked great (I played Fallout Shelter and SBK16, both of which worked the same as on the much faster i5 Asus C436).  For web browsing, it's usually zippy enough for most websites, and the overall experience is OK.  It will stutter here and there, but once things load, the scrolling is generally smooth.  I had 8+ tabs open, some with video content, and it held in OK.  That said, some websites take a long time to load (compared to the Intel-powered Chromebooks).  It can't play 4K YouTube content (which is fair, it's a small screen and 1080p looks great), and it doesn't have enough oomph to push pixels to any respectable external monitor - best it could do was 1080p at 24 fps, and 720p at 60 fps, which looked terrible on my Dell 27 inch monitor.  But it does plays online and on-storage media just fine, as long as it's 1080p or lower.- Tablet experience: so so... It seems to be sluggish in tablet mode, pages take longer to load, and sometimes Facebook doesn't know what I clicked and opens the wrong thing (especially with mediocre WiFi connection). Also, tabs are hard to switch as Chrome goes full screen in tablet mode I don't like that. I'm hoping this is early software and the sluggishness may be fixed with further updates, as it seems to be zippier with the keyboard attached.THE BAD:- Ports: you get one USB-C port, and that's it.  No audio out, no microSD.  I think the lack of a microSD reader is a huge miss.  I use a microSD card religiously on my Chromebooks - for viewing GoPro footage, and just as expanded storage for media.  You are constrained here to 64/128 GB.  Which is an odd move, likely one to save on cost.  To me, this makes a potentially versatile device very constrained and iPad-like.  I don't want to carry a dongle around with me for extra media storage.  This won't be an issue for everyone, but then again if you are buying a Chromebook instead of an iPad, you are probably more of a power user - so you may miss having a microSD reader.  Also would note that there were mixed reports out there - some said the Duet had a microSD, some said it did not... so I had to check personally.Nothing else really bad per se... but it's a bummer that we can't push the ports, speed, or tablet experience categories into the GOOD bucket.  Let's see if people end up finding a good use for this device.

  I purchased two of the Lenovo Duet Chromebooks (to replace two aging ASUS Flip C100P Chromebooks)--one for each of our school age boys. While the ASUS provided a great starter Chromebook experience to introduce our boys to a blend of web and android apps, it was starting to noticeably age and programs were not working as well anymore. When I heard about the Duet earlier this year, I immediately started to follow the news and preordered two from BestBuy at the end of April. After all the wait and hype, I was not disappointed. For my kids, this is by far the best value for the money and gives them everything they need for virtual school and beyond. Prior to having the Duet, our boys would use a mix of their Chromebooks and Amazon Fire Tablets for school/apps/media consumption. Now with the Duet, they are no longer interested in their Amazon Fire Tablets and use their Chromebooks for all school/apps/media consumption. The screen quality as well as the included keyboard and kickstand make this a great device for them and relatively easy to use. As a parent, having controls that are easy to set up and maintain over what they can access on the web through supervising their accounts with Google Family Link makes the experience of a Chromebook highly preferable to either pure Android/Apple devices (and I own and use both). In addition to the Lenovo Duet Chromebook, we purchased two of the HP USI Rechargeable Styluses (directly from HP as they are not yet available elsewhere yet) to augment their Duets. I'll also briefly mention that access for a line-in audio only through the one USB-C port does not hinder our ability to use the devices as our boys use reasonably priced Bluetooth Headphones (EasySM brand from Amazon) which pair and stay connected without any problems. The combination of the Duet, the USI Stylus, and Bluetooth Headphones is an amazing blend that all work well together. So glad that we found the Lenovo Duet Chromebook and I would highly recommend it for those looking for both a great value and high quality Chromebook for their kids!

  I only had a few days to use this before I discovered a flaw I thought was just a feature of the device, was actually a hardware defect. When you close the lid, it is supposed to sleep. Suspend. Instead, mine would shut down completely, logging me out and erasing any of my unsaved work in my apps. I use this for work, I can have that.However, I learned, having done a bunch of reading to figure this out, that this item page isn't the default item listing for the Lenovo C330 (this), so when I had to return the defective unit, I reordered my replacement through the Amazon listing itself. Theirs is 64gb, and the same price as this.That aside, I am blown away at how amazing this Chromebook is. It is so much better than it has any right to be at this price point. It's closest competition is a $474 ASUS. 2-n-1 Touchscreen at $240 is remarkably cheaper than the other options, so I very much assumed I would get what I paid for. But I got a much more valuable device for a heck of a lot less than I should have.It's quick, the speakers, while are not optimally placed for laptop mode, are the loudest (and still clear) speakers on any portable computer I've ever used (including laptops, tablets, and smartphones). It boots fast, it is kept up to date with the newest Chrome OS features, including being one of the few to get the formerly Pixel book exclusives like Google Play and Instant Tether. Linux apps are inbound as well.If you are needing a device that's fast, versatile, and affordable, go no further. But search around Amazon for the best possible deal. I'm going to be doing a much more thorough review on Amazon's official item page once my new replacement shows up.

  We just opened this today and so far I am very pleased. It was purchased for a student who has a chromebook at school so she was using it immediately and very thrilled to have it. The Amazon description doesn't have a model number but the paperwork says it is a C330. I'm thinking it's a newer version of the model since the description says it came out in November 2018 and there aren't any reviews yet. The C330 model 81HY0000US is listed as being released on Aug 2018 and I read those reviews before purchasing. I took a chance getting something without a review because it had a similar description to the C330 and it was able to arrive within 2 days. The white color is very nice, the weight is nice and it seems sturdy. There were remarks on the C330 reviews about settling for a resolution that wasn't as good as others, but I think the graphics are just fine. The keyboard has a nice touch and it has many features I was looking for - a touch screen; blue tooth; and being able to fold it to use as a tablet. Bonus: it sits in other positions for easy movie viewing; HDMI; USB slots, SD slot; camera, etc... I know you can get a more basic Chromebook for $150 - $200 but it was work paying $250 to get all of these extra features. I just can't see getting one without a touch screen. I don't know if the 32 GB instead of 64 GB is going to be an issue. We haven't tried to load any apps yet.

  I bought this for my wife as her old Chromebook had seen better days, Performance wise its great. It is a Chromebook so its all relative but for what she uses it for it performs flawlessly. The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. Screen is bright and google play apps (which is a big plus as Chromebook specific apps are limited and frankly poorly ported) appear to perform just as well as on her Pixel 2. The only complaint really is compared to her old Chromebook this thing feels like its made of lead. Not a huge deal if on a desk or on your lap, does however give your arms a work out if you are holding it in a tablet configuration. All in all though it is a great buy at $249 and more than any thing she is happy with it, which hell lets be honest is more important than anything.

  Could not stream xfinity video! All video streams are pixelated and lagging while another device (much older) streams just fine. Video was 720p, not even 4k!  The other things: inability to scroll. Can't do it. You have to scroll with the arrow keys. No CAPS lock. You have to hit alt and some other key to enable caps lock. Also makes you log in every time. Using your Google account password every time. I created a PIN# in the settings (a 6 digit number code) but it won't accept it... still have to use Google password.

  I like that it works very well. Snappy and comfortable keyboard track pad very nice and responsive. I liked the modes and use them since I have the computer.  good touch screen beautiful display. The problem I have is no back lit screen and it is not a 2019 model as mentioned in the ad for this device. This model came out in October 2018 which is not bad but, full disclosure this is not the newest device. After I secured the order I saw one also Lenovo that for a little more money could have had a newer device. No biggy but, Amazon should watch what they put in there ads. All in all I am happy with this device and will not send it back. But, my next purchase will be somewhere else and they only got 3 stars for lying.

  I used to have an old Acer Chromebook and I didn't realize how low quality it was until I got this Lenovo Chromebook. The screen is bright and clear, the touchscreen works well, the keyboard is nice to type on. I write the closed captioning for videos for a living, and this Chromebook makes it easy with the great sound quality and nice keyboard it has. My fingers would get tired and achy after using the Acer for a bit. But I just did three hours of captioning on this Lenovo, and I feel no strain on my fingers at all. I got a basic keyboard cover which helps with the feel of the keyboard even more, so I recommend getting a keyboard cover.  I'm really glad I ordered this Chromebook, I waffled between a few for about a week before taking a chance on this one. It paid off, I couldn't be happier with it. If all you do on the internet is use Google, social media, email and watch YouTube, this machine is wonderful and better than a full laptop. It's very fast and easy to use. It doesn't get viruses, it's not filled with bloatware, it's just a fantastic little internet machine. It's very much worth the money. This isn't the cheapest Chromebook you can find, but it's worth the extra money, it's very high quality. On the other end of the spectrum, there are Chromebooks that are very expensive, and I see no need for those at all. This one is just perfect.

  Purchased this computer for my granddaughter. She was so excited to open. When opened, the packaging did not appear to be new. I dismissed this until we turned the computer on, and another persons name popped up as the owner! This was not a refurbished or used computer purchase! I immediately boxed the computer up and requested a return. I purchase from Amazon weekly, if not more and problems are infrequent. This is quite frankly fraudulent business behavior. I would enclose a picture of the screen shot I took of the other persons icon, but the person probably wouldn‚Äôt appreciate this, as the name is somewhat unique. We reset the computer, as my granddaughter had already started loading a virus protection program. Shame on this seller. Ultimately, I went directly to Lenovo and purchased the computer (a guaranteed new one), for 15.00 less than I paid for this one.

  I bought this chromebook because I was tired of bringing my laptop (macbook) to and from work every day. I thought because it's about 1/4 the price of a macbook, it would be mediocre, but I really didn't want to spend that kind of money. I am wowed by the functionality, sharpness, and speed. I also love the 360 degree effect, kind of nice if I'm in the kitchen following a recipe. I'm super happy with it, and really recommend it.

  Gave this as a Christmas gift and I thought she would wear it out within the first 2 weeks! Very versatile computer with touchscreen and laptop/notebook capability. With the SD card slot, local ""hard drive"" capacity is expanded to add even more apps. Wireless connectivity was a breeze and the additional usb slot allows the option to add a true hard drive. Awesome product and highly recommended. Now to buy one for myself!!!!

  I love it. Fast, well built and elegant. I especially like the keyboard, I type a lot and was worried about this aspect, some 2 in 1 devices don't have a good one. But this keyboard is Supberb.Cons- Maybe a bit heavy when used as a Tablet. For that purpose I would prefer a detachable screen.

  I bought this because of great reviews, but certainly disappointed. There is no keyboard light even though it says it does. Why has Amazon not fixed that? It constantly losses it's Bluetooth connection. Says its on, 4 hours latter off. Connects to the printer one day, not the next. Price was very good, but after reading more about Chromebooks on line this has been a consistent problem. How can they not fix the Bluetooth issue, it's 2019 and they are a multi Billion dollar companyUpdated: 12-19 When I first got this I used it to send e mail because my computer I used for that had passed and I custom ordered a new one. I really liked it, I would have given it a 5. It is very poor. I stream, like hockey games, and other sporting events. All my other devices stream well no buffering issues, I have a 50 Mbps speed, the Lenovo buffers or stops all the time. Next, I don't know if this is software or Lenovo but I use Bluetooth. This unit is awful with Bluetooth, won't connect have to re-sync, you see the device, click on it, it won't connect. It's good for browsing and e mail. By the way it has no backlight keyboard as advertised. Not recommended by me!

  I am using this laptop since last one week or so. It is a great buy for the price. Display is great. if you are looking for second laptop to check emails and browse internet and don't need high speed response, this laptop is for you. This laptop supports SD cards but need regular SD card adapter and it sticks out. I bought BaseQi -iSDA 901A adapter from Amazon and it worked great. It is light and easy to carry around.

  For the price, it's not a bad laptop! I was skeptical about buying a laptop online, and one that isn't a Dell or Toshiba (I'm very picky about my electronics). But because of the Covid-19 Virus going around and with many electronic stores closed, I needed to improvise and buy a laptop for my work from home obligations. This is a very nice laptop. The battery life lasts a few hours on a full charge (about 5 hours, if I remember correctly) and the setup was fairly easy. This product does come with that S mode on it, but it was easily removed (a web window popped up on the website and allowed me to change it within a few seconds). My only issue with the laptop is that it tends to run a little slow sometimes. But it's not to the point I'm having to wait more than ten seconds. So I rate it a 4 out of 5. Would definitely recommend.

  This replaced an 11 year-old HP Vista windows, It was an easy set-up, it's light weight; Perfect for what I needed it for. Although I agree on some reviews runs a little slow, but if you need a laptop for shopping, job , kids first laptop or something to get you through this is it. So far I like it no complaints, but you be the judge, not bad for the $$ Windows 365, pre-installed for 1 year that's a win win alone . Enjoying it so far

  This was the worst experience with a laptop. Although the price is attractive, it is not worth the shipping cost the seller made me pay to return it. The laptop can not support windows. A simple task of opening a blank excel sheet, while opening the browser, caused the laptop to freeze. After 3 hours of trying to load an internet browser, I put it back in the box and returned it. But of course the seller knows the product is a scam, which is why I am still waiting, and probably won't receive a refund. It should've been either a chromebook or an e-reader at best.

  Horrible experience with this purchase. Advertused as coing with 1 yr subscription to Office. Laptop arrives and no prodcut key for office. Vendor wont help says to contact Lenovo, Amazon wont fulfill missing prodcut key,, and lenove says the product only comes with 1 month trial, anything beyond that is from Vendor.  Two weeks of ho help from any party.  Amazon did offer  a discount on purchasing Office...which they know from this order I ALREADY DID. But they expect me to do again.

  It runs something called Windows 10 S, which is for computers that do not have enough memory and computing power to run real Windows 10.  The computer has an option to run real Windows 10, but if you try to turn it on you receive a warning that you should not do so. Once you convert to real Windows 10 you cannot go back to Windows 10 S.That means you can only run a subset of in some cases crippled Windows 10 apps. For instance, if you want to install Chrome or Firefox you cannot without blowing away Windows 10 S and possibly breaking whatever is barely working.Even when running Windows 10 S it is slow. Everything takes forever to load.I am keeping the computer however. It minimally does what I needed. I wanted it to be able to play DVDs using an external drive, and I wanted it to be able to display the Amazon Music Player app properly. It does both those things. But any illusion I had that I could use this computer to program in computer languages using a visual GUI (eg Racket or Rust or even Python) is gone.Also be aware that this computer is only sold on Amazon by third parties. For some reason Amazon will not sell this computer directly. The price may be cheaper elsewhere.I would never recommend this computer for general purpose use. Someone said that he gave this computer to a student to use as the student's main computer. It is hard to believe that the student can use it without recurring problems. The student should focus on his schoolwork, not on figuring out workarounds to get this computer to do what it is supposed to.Advertising this computer as running Windows 10 borders on false advertising. It only runs a crippled version of Windows 10, not real Windows 10.One can get a Chromebook for the same price, and unless one wants to play a DVD the Chromebook will do everything this computer does and do it much better and faster, without any of the annoyances this computer brings with it. Good thing this computer is cheap, otherwise I would feel cheated.

  This product was what I needed. It is a very good laptop and even though the processor isn't highest quality, I have never had to wait over 10 seconds for something to load. When I use this it is usually only to look things up on the web and watch TV but seems like it can do lots of others! I recommend if you need a laptop but don't want to spend all the money and are fine with having to wait a few seconds. Very good!

  This sleek, lightweight, slim design, & EXCELLENT for adults, but even better for kids. My daughter is 13 and had been using MY verrrryyyy expensive huge HP Touch-Screen laptop. I bought her this for completing class assignments, to download her apps f/ Google Play Store on this laptop so I stop being over-crowded with HER stuff on my device, lol. I wasn‚Äôt expecting ‚Äòmuch‚Äô, yet when it arrived & we were about to open it up, we were both wondering if we  made a mistake by DECLINING the ‚ÄúProfessional Master Setup‚Äù...which quickly we turned this fabulous chrome book on to see that we saved loads by not purchasing that- simply bought laptop as-is brand new, and had it up & running in seconds.I literally am jealous, and find myself using HER laptop instead of my big expensive one, LOL. This is the 2020 Version & is flawless. Crystal clear screen, touch is easy, super simple to begin downloading her favorite apps (Roblox, Hulu Live, Netflix, TikTok, Skype, etc). She tried out the camera/video with me & I could see the clear screen w/ no lag.  I am DEFINITELY gaving a serious case of ‚ÄòFOMO‚Äô (fear of missing out) & am eager to purchase my very own exact laptop.I had never heard of this brand as a contender, but I‚Äôm thoroughly satisfied with all of the features- especially how long the battery lasts. It‚Äôs wonderful.I highly recommend this sleek, modern, easy-to-use chrome book laptop. :)

  This little Chromebook is perfect for adults as well as students. I bought one for my son for Christmas then purchased another for myself. It is small, light-weight, fast, and the price cannot be beaten. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop.

  Bought this for my wife for her job. She is not a huge techy but this Chrome book is working well for her needs. No more fight with kids over the  laptop. If you are used to Android, this should work for you.

  I like it, it arrived earlier than the posted datez which I can't complain about, but I have 3 problems with this item and I'm thinking of returning it. 1st its refurbished, not brand new. 2nd the screen is on the dimmer side so if I take it outside I can't hardly see anything on the screen (I adjusted the brightness setting to no avail) and the biggest problem I have with this particular chromebook is that it does not have windows 10. Honestly needed windows 10 and maybe its my fault I didn't read up on this item, but I needed a chromebook with windows. I'm going to give it some thought before returning but I'm really disappointed with the 3 things I mentioned above.

  I'm pleased with this purchase. I happened to order it just prior to quarantine and thankfully it arrived in time to see my child through remote school curriculum during the day while providing access to netflix, hulu, etc. in the evenings. I rarely get to say this....but I'd buy another one.

  Physically, this is fine. It looks great and the screen is easy to read. But if you're not used to using the Chromebook OS, it's not intuitive at all. I gave you a month try to see if it could work Since reading so many great reviews about it and how easy it was to use was part of why I got it. But it was difficult to use in every way. This includes using a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and connecting it to an external screen using HDMI. If you're used to Windows or maybe even Apple I wouldn't recommend getting this because those are somewhat intuitive, and this is not intuitive at all. I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't access the icons for the apps unless I had it in tablet mode.Basically, if you want to use this for anything other than browsing Google chrome, or having a computer sized tablet, don't get it.

  For the price, this is a great Chromebook. It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research.1. Solid build. Nice sturdy plastic chassis. (Keeps it lightweight)2.

ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.

  Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.

  Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can‚Äôt be downloaded on this chrome book.

  Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed.

  Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users.

  I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot.

  This is the first Chromebook I had, I used window desktop and laptop for 15 years. I don't know how the performance compare to others Chromebook, for me is just enough to open about 7 tabs with 1 youtube video playing, in this situation it is slow to move cursor and click the items on page. If you try to playback the 720p60fps or 1080p YouTube, I don't think the processor is good enough to play it as it is lag it you try to do other command, if you try to adjust the video playback speed, it will lag after a few seconds and the video and audio is not synchronized.If you want to keep the performance just below the limit of this laptop, you can only open 5 tabs on the same time with 1 youtube video 720p or lower quality.The startup time is 2-3 second, but there will be 2 seconds wait for the chrome load up a page. There will be 5-10second of opening a Google sheet. The Google map is not smooth to use on this laptop, lag to zoom in/out.For hardware, it is a 1080p mon, 2x usb-c(only 1 can charging), 2x usb-A, 3.5mm mic/headphone, a micro-sd slot. 32GB storage, 11GB for android, 2.5 for chromeOS, 18.5GB rom only.For me is good enough for light use such as web surface, using Google doc, sheet to do some travel research, the shortcut is also very good, fast to open/close/switch page. But I cannot use it for daily, I only use when I am lazy to turn on the desktop/ not using for a long time/ take it out for discussion.If you are using a middle range hardware(say i5-4430) computer for a long time, I don't think Lenovo 14e Chromebook can reach your standard of a computer, maybe you can try m3 core or even i3 core Chromebook, it should be fast enough for chrome os as it is a light os compare to window 10. Using this laptop spec for window 10 will be much worst than chrome os. For me, if buying a new Chromebook few years later should buy a i3 core CPU to make sure the performance, as I need is speed and fast enough to open 10 or more tabs and playback 1080p with 2x speed with no lag.To conclude,Pro:light usemaximum 6-7 tabs in the same time is okCheapPremium outlook1080p 14"" monCan load android apps but slowCon:Slow compare to mid range desktop.Small storage, 18.5GB onlyNo touch screen

  I spent way more time shopping for a cheap laptop than I care to admit. Used, refurbs, outlet deals...I looked everywhere for a halfway decent sub-$300 laptop that ticked all my boxes; lightweight, powerful enough to handle basic tasks (web browsing, emailing, office functions), at least somewhat ""future proof"", and not completely devoid of basic external connection capabilities. Nothing in the Windows OS world really offered everything I needed.I wound up narrowing my choices down to Chromebooks. This little Chromebook is, so far, perfect for me. It's not prohibitively expensive, but it's also no horribly cheaply made. I've owned a couple of cheap Chromebooks, and while they were plenty functional, they felt like toys. The build quality of this Chromebook is top notch. It's super speedy, boots up in an instant (as most Chromebooks do), and has all the basic functionality I need. The two USB ports are a huge plus, as is the availability of a Bluetooth connection. The screen quality is excellent. The display is bright and vibrant. So much so that I had to turn it down to 60%. Sound quality is lacking, but that's not really relevant, as no one's buying a Chromebook because they need exceptional sound quality. I'm not too fond of the trackpad. I can't quite find a mouse speed setting that moves the cursor just the way I like. It's not a big deal, though. It's more of a personal preference issue, and I use my external Bluetooth mouse most of the time.As a whole, this Chromebook is a solid 5 star purchase. For the price, it really doesn't get much better than this.

  I use this four days a week for around 2.5 hours a day of streaming Prime Video and mixed web browsing. Battery life is exceptional, probably close to 9 hours streaming Prime continuously. It is small and light enough to be really easy to carry in a backpack or such (I carry mine around the university campus in my backpack almost every day).The screen is surprisingly good. The picture quality is very sharp, and the viewing angles are actually pretty good for a TN panel (I use a VA on my desktop and am spoiled by the ridiculously good viewing angles).

  This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.

  The FHD (1920x1080p) version of the Lenovo S330 definitely does NOT have an IPS display. The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients.Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's. It'll work...but why?

  ... you receive a written promise from Lenovo quality control that they'll pay YOU for the time you'll need to spend doing their job for them. I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue.The value proposition for this Chromebook is that you can simply open the box, and get started working, hassle-free.  Value has not been delivered. If I wanted this much aggravation, I'd run one of my old Dell's with Vista.UPDATE: 4/23. Ran powerwash two more times. Spoke with Amazon. Spoke with Lenovo. Ran complete recovery of Chrome OS. Still freezes and crashes. Just ordered a second one for arrival 4/23, and am returning this one. Perhaps this one is just a lemon. If the second machine works as it should, I'll update here. If it doesn't, I'll return it also and post a second review. Total time wasted so far: 12 hours and counting.

  I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. However, it arrived as scheduled in great condition. We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it. Would recommend!

  I needed a laptop for working from home. I spent a lot of time researching which would be best for my needs. I needed to have a laptop that was decent, better than a chromebook and that could meet the requirements for my job. I also could not spend $1000 on a laptop. I ended up choosing this one. I do not regret my purchase. This laptop moves fast, the screen is clear. I did not have any trouble setting it up.  It does not glitch or randomly shut down as some reviews were saying. I am taking calls and remoting in to my work computer with this laptop. I also use it for Microsoft Teams. The video is good, but not the best which is ok for me, because I will not be taking any pictures or videos with this device. I did remove S Mode because I could not download a lot of programs that I needed with S mode. i was concerned because I read that it would slow the computer down and once deleted you cannot get it back. After researching more, I found that it actually does not slow anything down so I ended up removing it. Nothing bad has happened since removing S mode. I actually like it a lot better without it. If you are on a budget, I would suggest purchasing this one.

  My nephew needed a computer to do online school and  I thought it was a good deal buying this computer, I have a Lenovo ideapad 330 that works great and I thought buying Lenovo IdeaPad 1 14.0"" HD Laptop, Intel Pentium Silver N5030, 4GB , 128GB SSD, Windows 10 would have been the same. I bought the computer in February. However, to my disappointment the computer only worked for two weeks. I tried to return it, but was not able to because there was no return post in my area.  After spending $309 my nephew is still  without a computer. He was on Google classroom paying attention to his teacher and the computer started making a beeping sound and the screen went black and that was it. The computer has not switched on since. I am very disappointed.

  Had trouble getting the keyboard to display after logging in.  Tried to contact tech support from Lenovo.  They wanted a $5 deposit before I could talk  to a technician with my question.

  Hard Drive Too Small for Windows UpdatesI really liked the computer form factor and weight, and thought it would be a great alternative to my Macbook Pro for taking around to do some writing and browsing. However, it's proved to be unusable in the real world. It's annoying enough that Windows 10 Home forces you to update when you're in the middle of doing work, but this computer's 32gb hard drive cannot even fit the updates. So you basically cannot save anything to the hard drive at all, even tiny wordpad files.You cannot even fit the updates, because after a few of them in the span of 3-4 weeks, the system warns that you need at least 8gb of space to do so. I only have 2.5gb of space left out of the total 32gb, even though I saved almost nothing to the hard drive. So you cannot even get the Windows security updates after a few updates. (Disk cleanup doesn't work all, the status bar doesn't move one pixel for me.) Basically this computer is crippled from the beginning. This is a foreseeable design flaw on the part of Lenovo. So they didn't know that Windows 10 Home updates automatically and require X amount of disk space?When you call Lenovo for support, they just blame the software and have you uninstall the updates to make room. But then what is the point of updating? You can't even reformat and restore Windows, because you need 4gb hard drive space, just to delete everything, which makes no sense at all. Maybe you can upgrade to Windows Pro and replace the hard drive, but that's basically an additional $200.

  This was a waste of about $100. It currently sits in a cardboard box under my bed. When a new software update came around, the computer told me there was not sufficient space. So I deleted every file possible (all of my Microsoft Office for students apps, Spotify, random small files that were saved, etc.). I took it to the ITS department on my campus to see if they could help. They tried to defrag the drive and that did not help. Every time we refreshed the page that displayed the memory, the amount of available space changed and fluctuated for no apparent reason. We resorted to just continually clicking the refresh button to see how it randomly fluctuated, while we did not download anything.I tried to do a factory reset and the computer told me that there was insufficient space (which makes no sense to me, but I am a biology major and not a computer science major). What's worse, the software was forcing me to update because it said my old OS was no longer supported. So I was left with a $100 piece of plastic and some metal and glass. At this point, I put it in a box where it still lies to this day.

  This was recommended by a computer sales rep. We decided to buy it through Amazon because of a much better price than the local retailer. This laptop immediately should signs of problems connecting to WIFI. The mouse was slow to impossible at responding to finger tapping and swiping and the screen was freezing. We had it checked out by Geek Squad and they confirmed there was issues. They also said this was their #1 returned laptop for the same reason we are returning ours. We thought it would be comparable to the Chrome Book that were purchased by some of the elementary school computer labs. We decided to not purchase the Chrome book because the only person we knew who had one said it broke after they owned it a year. So there is no cheap route for a laptop and our daughter needs one for school so we will be purchasing a better quality laptop.

  The best way to describe this product is ""eh ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"". It was $160, and genuinely worth every single penny. Prior to this I had no computer or tablet of any kind outside my iPhone, and prior to that I had a MacBook Pro, so it's an adjustment, but truly perfect for someone like me who has no professional need for a personal laptop outside the office, and no personal computer related activities that make performance a must.That being said; the processor in this thing is incredibly slow, so patience is key. I feel a bit like I'm back in the late 90s waiting for my dial up to reconnect sometimes. Overall though, it does what I purchased it for, and I honestly only touch it a few times per month so spending any more would have been foolish.I would NOT recommend this for any college student or gamer of any kind, anyone working from home in any capacity, teenagers for school, or even professsional online survey takers. This is a cheap laptop that's honestly just for fun, light use.

  a little on the slow side but it is a great basic computer I use to bring to campus for notes.I wouldnt recommend doing any important or long projects on here as it does slow down and freeze up sometimes. I was doing an online test for class and the processor couldnt handle a big image loading with all my notes open too so it reloaded on its own, froze a litle and lost my test. other than that incident, the laptop does a great job for basic online tasks and using office.

  A good, solid, basic little laptop. Not going to do complex stuff, and it has no DVD drive and only 32 Gb of hard drive, but if you use an external drive or a micro SD card, you're all set. I use one-drive from Microsoft and it has been fine. This comes with 1 year of Microsoft office 365! A good deal. Decent performance and great for basic laptop stuff. I love it for presentations, writing, web surfing, YouTube, recipes, streaming, etc. Can't beat it for $150 or so.

0,ELECTRONICS (LAPTOPS),Lenovo,"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"" Laptop, 15.6"" HD (1366 x 768) Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3250U Processor, 4GB DDR4 Onboard RAM, 128GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 3 Graphics, Windows 10, 81W10094US, Business Black",$359.99,3.0,"
  The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:+Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here.+It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install.In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

  We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall.The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

  This laptop reminds me of why I stopped buying Windows computers. Straight out the box it's LOUD, FREZZES AND IS SLOW!!! HOW IS A NEW COMPUTER glitching and freezing up?? The picture I posted is the settings NOT OPENING! It showed that screen several minutes and finally I just restarted the laptop. I NEVER have this problem with my Chromebooks. It's been in ""thinking mode"" for about an hour now. Hopefully, my kids won't have problems logging into Blackboard. Guess it's time to go back to Apple since I can't use Blackboard on Chromebooks. Charging was pretty fast though. LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID, THE SOUND GOES OUT!!! IT GOES OUT EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR UP TO 1 MINUTE!!! I DO NOT recommend this!!

  For some context I am in my 20's and go to school online. I use this laptop for Youtube, Discord, Steam, online schooling, music and Netflix. It works perfectly and I enjoy the keyboard as it isn't too loud. It comes with four USB ports and even an HDMI hookup for projectors or TVs which is also nice. You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more ""crisp"" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn't feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at. All in all it's honestly a great laptop and very awesome for the price and better to spend this than buying a cheap one that will just break in a few months.

  Weeks after receiving this product, and after finally transferring all of my files from a Mac that I previously used, it will not start. I have.missed the window for amazon returns in part due to the holiday weekend conflicting with shipping schedules and amazon cannot help. I have consulted Lenovo extensively, every single person I talk to suggests a new way to hard reboot, to no avail. The one time it did come on again briefly it worked for about 2 minutes before shutting itself off again. I am in the process of sending it back to Lenovo because it is under warranty for repair or replacement, however, that will be.money out if my pocket to ship.Update: I have now received the laptop back and whoever worked on it in service put it back together incorrectly - the keyboard is warped and the machine wobbles when placed on a flat surface. Online Lenovo have said the technician must have seated the kayboard wrong on reassembly and I should take it to a service center... but the only service center in my state only services Thinkpads, not this one. It is useless for typing. Customer service are quick to respond and it isn't their fault but I would not buy this again nor recommend it to anyone else.

  Lenovo is usually a good product; this particular product, however, was terrible.  I am in the process of returning it for a full refund.  To begin with, out of the box and after the initial setup, there were many updates that needed to be done.  Most important was the BIOS update.  Well, after 2 weeks, and calls and help from Lenovo, the BIOS can still not be updated.  In fact, there are several issues that the computer won't accomplish.  I am very disappointed with this Lenovo product.  Rather that replace the terrible one I have with another Lenovo, I will find a better product

  I'm pleased with this unit.  We are a small business, and find this useful for test support, with the ability to have touch operations work with existing Windows software for lab equipment we purchase.  But was very disappointed that it needed an email address/account to switch out of Windows S - they wanted to link in the Microsoft Store even though I don't ever want this unit doing any Store purchases.  With Android I am allowed to not assign an account for what is basically a lab resource.  I know that in future I will avoid any computer that starts in Windows S mode - I don't want these inexpensive laptops having account info.

  ** Update after 3 trouble free months of use ... I'm thoroughly pleased with this little laptop. Super light , smooth , reasonably good processing speed , battery life and screen quality. At this price point it can't be beat. Is it 5 stars compared to a high end Mac book , gaming PC or Surface ? ... Of course not as those are $1,000 - $2,000. For less than $200 you are getting a lot as long as you have reasonable expectations.Just what I wanted in a nice light laptop package. I needed a replacement for an aging laptop and with the non-support of windows 7 come January 2020 I jumped a bit early...  Great for web surfing and travel , fairly fast and decent flash memory.*** If you want to use another web browser like Google Chrome or Fire Fox , etc. Be aware this is a Windows 10 - ""S"" ... S is supposed to stand for "" Safe"" as it locks you into using only Windows applications ( downloads )  and also only permits the use of Windows explorer browser.  Unfortunately like Lot of people that doesn't work well for me as Google Chrome is my phone (Android) and tablet browser and they all sync and work well together ... Everything from my bookmarks , favorites to my calendar and Google play (music) is not going to function as designed if only using Windows explorer browser.You can permanently exit the Windows 10 "" S"" operating system once (no return). I opened a windows explorer page and went to Google.com I then searched for Google Chrome and download the Chrome web browser. That's where you get a windows pop up saying you can exit the Windows ""S"" mode if you want to and go to the "" regular"" windows 10 operating system that allows you to download from outside sources . ( In my case Google Chrome) ... It seems to be working fine now in Chrome. I was able to important my Chrome bookmarks and Calendar , etc.* I think the windows ""S"" would be a great option for kids and some less computer savvy seniors to keep them out of trouble. It has a purpose but ""S"" is Definitely not for everyone .I'll update later as I use it more.

  I just got it yesterday, so I will update as I go, but so far, it's great. It's fast, it doesn't overheat, the battery capacity is up to standards. I've spent all day testing the limits. The only thing is, I would recommend bringing your own terabyte drive, and insert a micro/regular SD card. It has approx. 56 gigs of space to hold items. I (so far) completely recommend this laptop, for quick and easy access to things you need done. Thanks, Amazon.UPDATE: Aug. 22nd 2020.

  This is a really nice little machine. I was able to set it up and use it quickly. One recommendation I have is to consider taking the operating system out of S mode if you want to install apps or have more control.

  Very handy little work computer. For $160 I could break or lose it and not cry too much. Very lightweight, not a lot of power under the hood but still a great value.I didn't care much for Windows in S mode but with Ubuntu I can make great use of its limited resources. I last charged this Saturday night, I've closed the lid when I'm not using this but I've been using it a decent amount. Here we are Monday afternoon and the battery is at 59%.

  The good news is that you can circumvent the ridonk MS 10S O/S by simply downloading Chrome and making Chrome your default page in Settings.The bad news is that Lenovo's customer service team will try to sell you a $99.00 warranty package so that they can assist you with getting a free upgrade from 10 S to 10 Home, an option which is offered from the System page in other Lenovo models but not in this one.  WTH would I do that when I could just buy the software upgrade from MS?  So lame!  If a complete amateur like me could figure out the Chrome download move, I would hope the tech geniuses @ Lenovo would know about it and freely share it with their customers.  But noooooo.Otherwise this is a nice little laptop, a touch slow from time to time but a decent device for its price.  Lenovo CS is not worth a dime (let alone 99 bucks) so I would I would keep that in mind when comparing laptops of this level,

  Ok.  Let me start off by saying, my daughter loves this laptop.  It is able to do everything she needs it to do, she is working on entry-level 3D animation as an artistic outlet.  Despite some of the negatives, this machine is well worth what we paid for it.I would like to say the product description is somewhat misleading, or easy to misinterpret.  We ordered the AMD A6, which is supposed to come with Windows 8.1.  I assumed it was 8.1 installed.  I will say this is not the case.  On the upside, it does come with Windows 7 PRO and the upgrade discs for Windows 8.1 PRO.  The down side, there is no optical drive.  The lack of optical drive was known, since that is in the product description.The upgrading process was more laborious and tedious than I anticipated.  They were nice enough to include step by step instructions on how to easily perform the upgrade.  Unfortunately, the step by step instructions were wrong about the first step, at least regarding my laptop.  It called for pressing the F12 key during the boot sequence, in order to enter and make changes to the BIOS.  After several failed attempts to access the BIOS, I read the Quick Start guide and found the NOVO button.  The NOVO button is essentially a 1 button recovery, startup, BIOS or reset option.  So, I tried using this and was able to finally access the boot menu.  After getting through this road-block, it was just the waiting game for everything to get reformatted, transferred, etc...The upside of all this, we ended up with a Windows 10 laptop, since it almost automatically wanted to switch to Windows 10 after Windows 8.1 finished installing and it has been running great.

  I have always loved Lenovos (IBMs) and felt by the description this was the laptop for me.  However, reading the reviews about it being very slow had me worried that maybe it wasn't...until I got it, yesterday.  True, all the bundled programs did slow things down, but once I uninstalled pretty much everything except software for the hardware.  (Note: all new computers come with bundled software - this isn't anything I didn't expect.)  I installed MS Security Essentials for virus protection, and my own licensed copy of Office 365 with Office 2013, and it works beautifully.  Not slow, not chuggy - it's great!  I intend to use this for everything except gaming and I don't have a need for a CD/DVD player or burner, so I'm confident I have purchased the perfect laptop for me.I intentionally purchased this laptop with Windows 7, as I wanted it it be compatible in every possible way with my worth computer and my other home computers, but it came with Windows 8 disks, and I know I can upgrade to Windows 10 if I want.  It's not often you buy a computer with so many options for operating systems!

  I got this computer because I needed a good non expensive laptop for basic work functions. Well I will tell you that I have been NOTHING but frustrated and severely ticked off beyond belief. The computer arrived on time but it was pre-loaded with Windows 7(suppose to be Windows 8.1), the battery is all kinds of broke it wont hold a charge and the computer states the battery is damaged. So it is going to cost an additional $40.00 bucks to get one and the laptop was suppose to be touch screen and it is not.

  For the money, this is pretty good. I'd like to find some more memory that is compatible to bring it up to 16GB because of the graphics programs such as GIMP and Inkscape that I like to use. The processor has just enough punch to make it quick and responsive. You'll want to get rid of most of the unnecessary programs packaged with it.

  I bought this laptop for my son(10 years old) for Christmas and when I first got it up and going it was slow and I was going to get a faster hard drive for it but before I did I downloaded the new Windows 10 upgrade and now it works just fine! Screen is big and is very sturdy and my son loves it! So glad it worked out :)

  I just use it for random web browsing, email, etc. No games or movies. It's fine. Just fine. Don't expect much, okay? I know it's inexpensive, but, DANG. Also, don't believe anyone who tells you it has a DVD drive. It doesn't. I was told it does, and when I contacted the seller about this, they ignored me. Wish I had never bought it. First truly negative review ever, I believe, if that says anything.

  As my title sums it up. This product went from bad to worse. My daughter used it about 3 months when the top of the screen by the camera got so hot it melted a small hole in it. Needless to say when I saw that we stopped using it all together. I am currently going through the process of waiting for the repair center to fix it. This is the worse part. They said they would fix it in about 7 days from receipt of the faulty laptop. They have had it for over 6 weeks now. I have called them twice and they tell me they do not know when they will get parts to fix it. I have ordered another laptop from Amazon and I can guarantee you it was NOT a Lenovo.

  The specs for the laptop I received were not what was in the description. The laptop shipped with Windows 7 (not 8), along with a bunch of Windows 8 CDs for operating system recovery that are useless to me. The RAM is also less than described. Wifi worked out of the box but broke down after a few hours of use when Windows 7 downloaded updates. Apparently the laptop was not built to run Windows 7 and it's essentially bricked the machine for me. I'll have to disable all Windows updates and revert the last update to fix wifi.The laptop was cheap, but even so I'd expect to at least get the laptop that was described to me.

  This laptop is ok. It's not bad, really. For $160, I'm surprised at how not awful it is, but still you need to be a bit tech savvy to operate it.First, it gets HOT. As soon as I turned it on, within ten minutes my lap was hot and I could feel heat radiating from the keyboard. But, even an hour later, it was still hot but nothing broke.Second, it comes with Windows 10, but in S mode. S mode means you can only install things from the Windows store. For example, Chrome is not there. You can download a setting from the windows store that gets you out of s mode, but then your drives break and you have to restart. Then it's ok.Also, It's not fast. I figured I could forgive anything if it just was quick, but the CPU constantly stays around 50, or even up to 100. I haven't been able to open any apps until windows update is finished (at 100%). I turned off start up apps, reset windows defender, the usual. It's still 85-100 just sitting there.So, it's aight. It'll get the job done for class, and it's small and lightweight and the screen is pretty, but you should know a bit about computers to be able to set it up, or else you'll be a sad panda.

  The case is a bit flexible but not appearing to be brittle or easily cacked. . .just feels a bit inadequate.  Boot time is acceptable, but not the quick boot time I'd expected with a eMMC. . .about 2 solid minutes.  Once booted, reading journals is quite fast.  Screen quality is very good.The 60GB eMMC comes with about 45GB available.  Upon set-up, it is crucial one reads each item as presented. . .both Microsoft and Lenovo  have desires for a great deal of personal information that the user must OPT  OUT  OF .  It is well presented and honesty displayed. . .easy to un-check the boxes.There is a slot for a micro-SD card.  My 32 GB micro-SD will provide ample storage for my travel uses.The biggest downside is the Microsoft Windows 10-S Mode.  This is Microsoft's attempt to emulated the marketing gimmick Apple employs. . .lock the user out of anything except Apple Apps.  Fortunately, Microsoft offers the user the ability to 'switch OFF'  the S-mode; thereby allowing the computer to load non-Microsoft programs.  After a few hours struggling with the S-Mode,  I switched it off and was then able to set up the computer to meet my needs.UPDATE:  To reduce boot time unpin unnecessary apps from the start page.  My new boot time is less than 30 seconds.  Another reviewer mentioned heat:  Indeed the bottom becomes warm,  but no warmer than a smartphone when it is heavily used.Speakers are located on the bottom, precisely placed so when the computer is on one's lap, the speakers are mostly obstructed.  The result is far less than ample volume.  The headphone jack is the best option.

  I just got it earlier today. I plugged it in and was waiting for it to load. I would have enjoyed watching paint dry with the outcome of it all. It said it connected to the internet then as soon as you go running its updates like you have to for ALL new computers. It drops it over and over again. Oh, there isn't anything with my internet when I have three phones, three tower computers, three full-sized laptops, two paperwhites, one Android tablet, two kindles with a keyboard, and five kindle fires that can connect to the internet. So it's going to go back and I will try again ordering something else from somewhere else. The wifi is open and a small little laptop doesn't want to stay connected. Sounds like something else is wrong here to me at least.

  This notebook computer is a excellent choice for those who will use it for basic browsing, email, and light Microsoft Office application work.  The notebook is lightweight, the screen is very visible and usable for even those with non-perfect eyesight.  The computer has an HDMI port which allows the connection to a larger external monitor.  There are two USB ports for connect of a mouse or larger external disk drive.  This performance of the computer is more than adequate for basic use; it is not a computer that can be used for gaming or other advanced purposes that require a very fast chipset, graphics, etc.The wireless on this computer has performed well after connecting it to a home router.  The speed is good and I have experienced no drops or delays.This laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode.  The first thing most users will want to do is change this to Standard mode so non-Microsoft applications can be installed such as Chrome and Firefox.  It is easy to find instructions on-line on how to do this change in Setup - it is pretty simple.With MS Office installed the OOTB applications take up about 20G leaving about 40G for other applications on the hard-drive.Overall I am impressed with the value of this laptop for the money.  It is a good choice for a basic computer.

  I have owned multiple computers, multiple windows computers, chrome laptop and even Ubuntu OS (self installed).  In summary, I am extremely satisfied with this computer, it is fast, quiet, nice feel to the keys, quick to start up and fast on the web similar to my chromebook. I think it starts up so fast because of the SSD, since it is small, I think Microsoft did not add so much bloat software so it runs lean.  The small SSD is also a negative, with the small memory drive, only 32G you can't store many videos or pics.  I added a micro SD card I had around for 16G but you can easily add a larger micro SD  if you plan to save pics and videos.  I mainly needed a computer to log onto my work citrix main frame and at first it did not work but I downloaded flash and then downloaded the citrix app and now I can log in to my work. I also needed a computer with power point and excel and it comes already installed, could not go wrong with this.Pros:-Fast on the web-Fast with opening applications-Netflix app-Starts up quickly (probably < 20 second from start up to surfing the web)-Pre-installed Office-Lightweight, easy to carry-Sleek look and feel-Great battery life, getting about 5-6+ hours with regular use (web and applications)Cons:-Small SSD (32G)-No other cons

  Ok so the only thing this has going for it is the name. Its great for a basic school computer, but if you want to install any programs other than Microsoft Office... well... good luck. The most frustrating thing about this laptop was that in the item specifications it list the RAM as DDR3. and in the Q&A it says you can add RAM. I purchased this expecting to upgrade the RAM. However I quickly found out this is not the case! The RAM is soldered directly to the motherboard and CANNOT BE UPGRADED! This is nothing more than a glorified Chromebook. I highly suggest you click away from this one!

  Got this for my elderly dad who only browses the internet and plays solitaire . He's had it since September and its painfully SLOW. I tried to factory reset as that's what was recommended And it runs through the process then says it doesn't have enough memory to complete it. Its super frustrating! On a fixed income he can't afford a lot but this is awful. I'm hoping they allow a return honestly.This is an update on June 24th 2018 a little over 10 months with this laptop and it has officially died. It had been getting slower and slower and then yesterday it prompted for an update which he followed through with, I believe it was for Windows update, and now the screen comes on but you can't do anything. It's dead as a doornail and now I'm not sure what we're going to do. This computer has been a problem since day one and I would not recommend it. I'm going to try to reach out to the seller again to see if they could help us out.

  I had to return the first one.  My son in law works on computers for a career.  On the first one, the CPU was bad so I returned it and got a second one.  He has updated everything and even added virus protection.  For a simple computer to basically surf the internet and email, Netflix etc it is okay.  However there is not much ram to this so you will need jump drive.  The laptop looks and feels great, perfect size! For the money, not bad!

  I got this laptop for my retired mother, so she could go online and type a few documents.  After a few months use, the computer prompted her to do updates, as all PC's do.  But there was not enough memory for the computer to do the updates.  She had less than 1 gig of personal data on the computer and didn't download any programs other than office programs, which take about 2 gigs.  But, with such a micro-hard drive, there is no way to update windows.  So, she can continue to use the computer without the updates, but that will only last for so long, before the computer is absolutely useless.

It is smooth as silk; only had to hard restart ONCE in 4 months of service because of an update. It is definitely a warrior worth buying for daily use.

  I bought this computer 6 months ago all of a sudden it quit working. I had to have one immediately so I purchased another one from Amazon the second one lasted 33 days they will not take it back because it's been more than 31 days. It's a great little computer for the money but both of them have the same problem they all of a sudden just quit working and will not charge up or do anything even if you plug the power cord in nothing works so now I have to call the manufacturer and I've already been told it's a 5 to 10 week turnaround. I want my money back but of course I'm not going to give my money back to just going to warranty it out and I'm going to have to go buy another computer so whatever you do do not buy Lenovo I've bought two of them I love them until they quit working and they do not stand behind their product at all which is sad because when the computer works it works great but all of a sudden it'll just quit working with no warning and I have to have it for work. Spend the extra money and get a HP I had a HP laptop last 9 years. I'm very unhappy with Lenovo products I bought two of the same identical laptops and both did the same thing the first one lasted way longer than the second one. All they do is sit on my desk they're not in cars I don't carry them around. They both looked brand-new this is a 100% joke and now I have to go buy another one please please please do not buy this computer or any Lenovo products because they will not stand behind them!!!!

  This is my first ChromeBook. I bought it as a gift for my wife to do emails and web surfing, which is supposedly what ChromeBooks are designed for.It's OK, but slow even for a ChromeBook, and the Chrome browser has a habit of freezing for 10-30 seconds from time to time unexpectedly and inexplicably.The screen is, however, crisp and bright and the keyboard is sturdy.As far as the Chrome OS itself, it's OK, but we hate gmail.

  We received a Lenovo which was advertised as new. When trying to install and get it ready to work, my IT guy contacted Lenovo and found out that the computer was at least 18 months old, had been repaired in July 2019 and only had 67 days left on it's warranty. When he tried charging the battery, it charged up very slow and then once charged, and unplugged, immediately started losing power. When contacted they said they only send out new computers - which is extremely untrue since we contacted Lenovo with it's serial number. I returned it a week ago and am waiting for a refund.

  For the price, this is an excellent Chromebook. After opening the box, I've done my fair share of research.1. Solid build at an undefeatable price. Not many things you can do now for 110 bucks. A full tank gas for my SUV costs more than that.2. USB type C port, SD card slot, and USB 3.03. 4 gigs of RAM is good though the 16gb memory is not enough, just insert $3 32gb micros sd card, it is much better than spend $100 more for a 64gb disk. With 20 bucks, we can make it 144GB. Why buy more expensive one. Besides, you have google cloud free for you.5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad.6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.7. Great for travel. I wanted something I could put in my carry-on, perfect in size and 10 hours movie time on the flight. That is incredible.You get a lot for the low price, it is hard to believe. I think the fair price for this one would be 150 at least. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a touch screeon display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super cool if it is a touch screen. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.

  Not even worth the 100 bucks I paid for it. There, I said it.  Oh I tried to justify it. ""It's only 100 bucks, it ain't so bad"", I kept telling myself. But after a few hours of trying to get things done with the 100E, I just have to admit this to myself: it's just not a good Chromebook and a waste of a Benjamin.Let me preface this by saying that I've had probably 8 or 9 different Chromebooks in my life, of varying sizes and price points. This includes 4 different 11-inchers I've used for various purposes. I'm comparing my experience with the Lenovo with that of those other 11-inch Chromebooks. Apples to apples, and all that.It's such a tempting thing isn't it? For a hundred bucks you get a full fledged Chromebook, and it's even got 4GB of memory which is pretty much the minimum even for Chromebook.Should be at least ""good enough"", right?But jeez this thing has probably THE worst screen of all time. Everything is washed out. Blacks are barely gray. Text is slightly blurry. You can force to resize the resolution within Chrome itself but no matter what, the quality of the screen is just awful.Despite the aforementioned reasonable 4GB of memory, and a -in theory - acceptable processor (MediaTek MT8173C), it's a very sluggish machine. Even basic web browsing just feels slow, like it's fighting to pull up basic web pages. The WiFi radio appears to be a culprit as well, although I haven't run any real tests about that. Point is: even basics are slow with the 100E.They keyboard is black and the key markings (letters) are very dark, so unless you're using this in a well-lit room, you better be a good touch typist. Except of course due to the mini size of this, keys may not be where you think they are. Everything is super cramped so even if you're normally a good touch-typist, you'll be missing keys. It's frustrating but this latter issue is not confined to Lenovo, it's a size thing.What IS a Lenovo thing is the shoddy quality of the keys. Travel is weird (too high) and the keys FEEL like the cheapest plastic possible. Even for a machine that costs 100 bucks I expected more since it comes from Lenovo. But the keys on the 100E are the worst of all my 11-inch Chromebooks.Of course there is no backlighting at this price point. No surprise, and many folks don't feel like they usually need one - but you really need it with a terrible keyboard like this.The top lid is a fingerprint magnet.The body is surprisingly thick and clunky.I do love that it charges via USB-C and has 2 such ports.For this price point you can't expect miracles, but honestly, it's so slow and sluggish, I wouldn't even give this to my 4 year old. (He has a 100 dollar Teqnio Chromebook from Walmart which is astoundingly good for the money, with far better screen, better keys, and faster performance)It's too sluggish to even use as a security camera monitor. You can watch Youtube videos on it but with that awful screen, it won't be pretty.I'm keeping this as a backup to my backup computers, maybe throw it in the back of the car (without being logged in to Google account, for security reasons) or maybe I'll give it to a homeless person or something (hey, free Wifi at McD+ this 100E + free time = next great American novel),  but besides that I just can't recommend it. Not even for 100 bucks.

  This chromebook has a great price and is rugged, lightweight, portable, and truly goes 10+ hours on a charge. So far all the Android apps I‚Äôve wanted are available and loaded from the Google Play store. I‚Äôve added the calculator, Amazon Kindle, Rbdigital, Messages, Calendar, Brother iPrint, Polaris Office, File Manager and Hangouts apps to this Chromebook and still have 7 of the 16GB of SSD available! Gmail, google maps, google keep, youtube and youtube tv work great in the included chrome browser.

  This is a great little Chromebook! It was made by Lenovo for K-12 education so has features like a spill proof keyboard and rubberized edges to protect against drops. Its not very heavy and the size at 11.6"" is perfect for travel. The screen is pretty good--typical for a Chromebook but not ultra high def IPS quality like on an expensive laptop. Since its a Chromebook and not a full fledged laptop it can only have programs that install to the Chrome browser itself. Hard drive space is minimal so you can't download large files unless you store them on an external USB drive or portable drive. If you looking at this laptop, but aren't familiar with Chromebooks, it helps to try them out and do a little research first to see if they will work for what you need. I just needed an inexpensive computer for travel so I wouldn't have to bring my expensive Dell laptop. Its perfect for that.  I've only had it a short time but so far its working great for web surfing, watching YouTube and some word processing via Google Docs. Sometimes thats all you need.

  A year ago I bought a Lenovo flex 14 with an amd ryzen 5 3500u, 12gb ram, 256gb ssd, backlit keyboard, and fingerprint reader for $550 (plus tax and shipping). That model has 4gb ram soldered to the board and a slot with 8gb ram upgradable. This new ryzen 3 4300u model seems to be selling for $400 and some sellers are upgrading the factory installed 128gb ssd to different sizes for a little extra (this isn't something Lenovo is doing, it's the sellers on Amazon). The new 4xxx cpu does seem like an upgrade so far (even going from a ryzen 5 to a ryzen 3). The 4gb of ram is soldered with NO extra slot to hold additional memory if you want to upgrade. There is no backlit keyboard, or fingerprint reader. I'm perfectly happy with the sellers upgrading the ssd, but pretty unimpressed by the other downgrades from the previous model. There are some ryzen 5 and ryzen 7 flex 5 models that seem to ship with more RAM, backlit keyboards, and fingerprint readers, but the price is nearly double. I would be ok with a $50-$100 price jump from the previous model if the CPU was the only thing that changed (upgraded from 3xxx series to 4xxx series), but instead they split the line up into a lower end model with a handful of downgrades for $400 and a higher end model with the CPU upgrades and seemingly nothing else for $700+. This review would be significantly more positive if the ram were upgradable, or 8gb+ soldered, but 4gb is really low even for this price.On a final note, some sellers offering this model with SSDs larger than 128gb are shipping the 128gb model without the SSD upgraded, so be sure to check once you've completed setting up windows (the sticker on the box will say 128gb no matter what). I had to ship back an order with the wrong SSD size and buy from a different seller. Second order was correct.Edit: I should in fairness include that aside from my disappointment in the downgraded specs from the previous generation and lack of upgradability, overall it's a good system for the price, and it pulls it's weight with what it has. My frustration in the review above is entirely in feeling like Lenovo had something good with the previous model and cheaped out with this model. I've got some applications that won't open at all due to the RAM being too low, and I can't upgrade it. Aside from that, for general use and light gaming it's a decent system for the price.

  I couldn't have asked for anything better than this!! It folds so easily and is a perfect size - compact but not tiny feeling. I usually combine the keyboard and touch features and use both concurrently. Easy to flip into one or the other. The screen is crisp and clear and the keyboard functions perfectly. If I had to find one fault, and I'd be searching for sure, It would be that the touch to wake it up is a little tough to figure out. I could have sworn that it used to wake up with a touch to the pad, but now usually wakes up with a double click in the lower right corner but not always..... Honestly could be just operator error. I would definitely buy this again. I am 100% satisfied!

  I've been using a refurbished tablet for a couple of years.  I like the tablet, but it got dropped one too many times.  :-(However, this Lenovo 2-in-1 blows my old tablet out of the water!  Has a nice long battery life - compared to what I am used to anyway.  I can use the laptop for two or three hours in an evening and the battery is usually only halfway used up.I've used it mostly in laptop mode, and I love it.  The verdict is still out on using it in tablet mode, but will update my review when I know more.

  Disappointed in the processing speed.  It's also ""glitchy"" which is concerning.  Did a virus check which came back negative, but periodically the screen will glitch or freeze.  I was also really disappointed that the background feature on Zoom is not compatilbe with this laptop (since I rely on the background function for meetings). On the positive side, I like the feel of the keyboard and the fact that it still has 2 USB A ports.

  The product you order DOES indeed come with a 128GB micro SD card.  HOWEVER the chromebook itself does not have a micro SD slot!  In order to use that 128GB of storage, you need to use the included SD adapter, which sticks out of the side by about 3/4 of an inch.-Just begging to be broken off.  So if you're thinking, like me, that that 128GB of storage will neatly disappear into the side of that chromebook, the way micro SD cards do, it won't.  Don't know why in today's world Lenovo would design it this way, but I'm pretty disappointed.  It's going to be sent back.

  For a relatively cheap laptop i did not have high hopes for this but it continued to surprise me. It would make a good school laptop.Pros:- It had a lot better battery life than i expected, about 10 hours on one charge i think while using google sheets and some youtube.- Lighter than i thought it would be but this is also the smallest laptop I've owned.- Nearly any app you can install on your android phone can be installed on this.- It would be a good office/school presentation laptop. I plugged in the HDMI out port to a Onn TV and had spreadsheets open and youtube without a problem but some video apps not so much (more below).- This can run visual studio CODE just fine so far for programming. I have not tested this a lot since i'm not used this particular program. You will have to enable lunix and look up a walkthrough on how to install it.- When you flip the screen around to use it as a tablet the keys on the back get turned off so you don't accidentally type when your taking notes. I used the Squid notes app and a stylus (not Bluetooth or anything) and it wrote better than i expected.- You can install Microsoft oneNotes and oneDrive as well.- It comes with google sheets and docs installed but they open up the web versions. You can download the apps and make your important documents available offline as well.Cons:- Like i said before, it can run mobile android apps but if you want the full desktop version (like steam) you might have to do some extra steps.- (This is only if plugged into a external TV, otherwise there are no problems). It has a HDMI out port so you can connect a external monitor or TV for another screen. I originally bought this for trips so i can watch HBO max or Netflix on a bigger TV with better picture and sound. When i tired this the video would not play on the external monitor and would only show a black screen. YouTube worked fine though. This was all done on a Onn brand TV and i will do more testing.- Speaker was not crazy loud but not horrible.- As i said before this will download mobile apps and not the desktop versions. My wife downloaded tiktok and while it was in the laptop setup it was just a small window the size of a phone screen. She folded the Chromebook and turned it sideways and it changed to full screen.- To play games on it (Xbox or Google Stadia) you will need a wireless controller. I used a wired USB controller and it did not work right period. You will also need really good WiFi or use the Ethernet port while you play. I tried Halo Reach about 8 feet from my router and had horrible screen tearing and something like 144p graphics. Which this isn't a gaming PC anyway.

  This is a great Chromebook.  I am a teacher and use this at home for Google Classroom.  Extremely fast and easy to use.  Just open the Chrome and it starts right away.  It was so easy to get it started.  Take it out of the box, sign-in to Google and you are ready to go!  I like that you can use both a mouse or touch screen or both at the same time.  I like that I can flip the screen and use it flat with the touchscreen too!  Great product so far!

  This laptop is good for very light gaming. typing documents/note-taking surfing the interwebs. Watching YouTube vids scrolling through Facebook, scrolling through Instagram, googling things. This laptop is lightweight and super portable. Now it‚Äôs on to the bad side of this laptop 1.the speakers are not good I highly recommend getting a Bluetooth speaker or a 2.1 surround system, or some headphones. The camera is not so good either it‚Äôs not HD Quality it‚Äôs SD Quality 480p or 480I. These laptops are easily scratched and dented if you drop them so avoid that at all cost. It also has a habit to leave fingerprints on the laptop which is annoying but they wipe themselves away after a while. There is also not enough storage built-in 32GB is not enough you need more at least 64GB or 128GB needed. Or you can get a portable hard drive at least 500 to 3TB to store all sorts of important stuff.  The keyboard and the Trackpad are sweet no problems what so ever. I owned 4 of these laptops and not one has failed me has of yet. Update in 2020 you can't put mac osx on them they are incompatible with intel Celeron CPU, your best bet is Linux. Windows 10 goes too slow on this laptop the desktop is always glitching in and out because of the low graphics card. Windows 10 updates are a no go, there is not enough space to apply them, and there is nothing you can do about it 32GB is not enough space for anything let alone updates from windows 10. NO, you cannot put updates from windows 10 on a USB stick or External DRIVE. Your best bet and your only option is to install Linux.

  I went into this purchase with the full knowledge that it is, in fact, a very cheap laptop. All I needed it for was browsing the internet and (casually) streaming video - nothing more. This computer, however, could not handle those basic tasks. Sometimes it would take around 10 seconds simply to load the start menu, and to load the initial video streaming page took over 30 seconds in general (even after, yes, I downloaded updates). The trackpad was also unacceptable - very unresponsive and required multiple clicks to register anything most of the time. Ultimately yes it's cheap, but for me the performance was more than abysmal and I couldn't justify even this price for a basically non-functional machine, so I returned it.

  ‚ÄãThis computer at this price is unbeatable!I had to take my MacBook in the shop and needed a laptop to get me through a tough stretch of grad school. After going through and returning several PCs that cost between $500-$700, I landed on this cheap guy and stood pat. It functioned well for a great price; you can't beat it for under $200. I am a writer and needed an excellent keypad, and this Lenovo more than served its purpose. The internet is a tick slower, but the machine and it's cost was worth it. There is also very little storage, but at this price, just add a removable storage device. Unless you are photo or video editing, this computer will serve you well in school or daily home use. I highly recommend it.

  I feel like it might be unfair to give this 3 stars, because it very much is what it is advertises: a decent-ish budget laptop not meant for heavy processing. However, I got this to use exclusively for web browsing, with the intention of loading nothing on it but antivirus software. Even using it that way, it still lagged loading web pages--on some pages more than others depending on how many pop up video suggestions or email newsletter requests, etc. there were on the page. (Cnet.com is a great example if you need a frame of reference.) I returned it and went with something a little bit more powerful. I still didn't wind up with a $1,500 laptop, but by spending around $350, I was able to get something that seems to be able to handle any website. That aside, it was of decent quality, it was nice looking, and I had no complaints about its display, configuration, or other features.

  We have had this laptop only for a few months, and the hard drive is so small and upgradeable, that now (without having loaded ANYTHING on it), it's so full that the laptop grinds to a halt 5 seconds after watching a video on youtube or doing anything useful.

  After completing the Windows setup (which Cortana mostly helps you get through), including creating a PIN (not a password), it is advisable to take the Lenovo Flex 11 out of Windows-S and switch to Windows 10 Home.

You can set up your PIN again by going to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options code (0x8007054f)‚Äù No security settings were changed by me, and there is no way to go beyond this page, so there was no going to Settings>Accounts>Sign In Options.The only thing left to do was shut off the laptop and refresh the PC (start setup all over again), which I did, but the problem still persisted, I was locked out when I closed the lid or the computer went to sleep. One more refresh and I found out that if I turned the power off instead of shutting the lid, the PIN still worked, but who wants a computer that you can‚Äôt shut the lid and resume where you left off when you open it back up? Not me! Unfortunately, Windows S ONLY allows a PIN for credentials.Windows S mode is mostly for school use and disables many settings, blocks any programs other than those from the Microsoft app store, and locks your browser into Microsoft Edge and Bing as the search engine. Chrome and Firefox will not load since there are no Microsoft apps for them. I certainly would have changed from S mode anyway, so switching out of it is no loss. Once it is switched out of S, it cannot be switched back, for that I am grateful! Switching is a quick and easy process. Changing to Windows 10 Home is free, while updating to Windows 10 Pro costs $99 on this machine. Lenovo provides some documentation with a Microsoft link on how to switch, so I won‚Äôt go into that here.Once I finally switched into Windows 10 Home I felt relieved. Settings that were absent in S mode appeared in their familiar locations and I created a local password deleting the PIN business altogether. That just seemed like a disaster that was not ready to be implemented. Now, I know that this is Microsoft‚Äôs issue, but Lenovo has to take some blame here for not thoroughly testing this new version of Windows on their systems. Buyers of a new Flex should not have to go through all of that drama, and most people would have to contact Lenovo Support to fix this issue.Ok, so now I have a Flex 11 that was not going to lock me out, whew! The Lenovo Flex 11 boots up Windows 10 really fast. I had never heard of an Intel Pentium Silver processor before, but it does a good job on this computer with the 4 GB of DDR RAM. Now I wouldn‚Äôt do extensive movie rendering on this machine, but I‚Äôm sure that it can handle simple movie editing providing there is enough space on the SSD, remember this machine only has a 64 GB drive, 55.7 once formatted, and Windows takes up a big chunk of that. Luckily Lenovo includes a single USB 3.0, USB 2.0, USB-C port and SD Card support to attach a flash drive or an external HD, not to mention any other accessories, mouse, keyboard, etc. You may want to purchase a hub for more ports though. I would advise to save most files using OneDrive or other cloud-based services. Most people will probably either use the Flex 11 as either a laptop or a tablet, but keep in mind it is BOTH. That is why it has nice thick hinges on it and can be flipped so the keyboard is flat against the screen. Just be careful not to touch the power button which protrudes from the side of the system and inadvertently put the machine to sleep (I‚Äôve done this several times). When using it as a tablet the touchscreen is responsive and Windows 10 will switch to tablet mode, bringing up an onscreen keyboard, turning off the physically attached keyboard and touchpad and enlarging icons.When using the Flex 11 as a laptop, the keyboard has a solid feel, but is not backlit - a feature that I would have liked to have. The touchpad works well, but the left click is a little bit mushy, sinking down a bit too far than I would have liked, so I wonder about the overall durability in the future. The laptop has a HDMI port to connect to an external monitor or television if you want to use it on a screen bigger than 11.5 inches. Speaking of the screen, the quality is about what I would expect for a computer in this price range ‚Äì not extremely sharp like an iPad, but still not too bad, it has a limited viewing angle, does not have deep blacks or rich deep colors, but is very adequate. The 802.11ac Wi-Fi is quick, which is important because most of the files will probably be saved to the cloud on this machine due to the limited space. The fast Wi-Fi also helps to prevent buffering while watching movies. Since the native screen resolution is only 1366 X 768 it is not capable of displaying 1080p HD video. The speakers on the Flex 11 are located on the bottom front corners and are tiny, so therefore pretty tinny sounding, however the Dolby Audio does a great job of special separation. Luckily you can connect Bluetooth speakers or headphones for a better sound when needed.Included with the purchase of this machine is a one year subscription to Office 365, some other reviewers mentioned it is a 30 day trial. That is incorrect. Other than Lenovo Vantage, which is their support and update hub there is no bloatware installed. Lenovo gives you the option to install McAfee LiveSafe, but I chose not to, just using Windows Defender.After removing Windows-S and changing to a straight Windows 10 Home version I am very happy with the Lenovo Flex 11. It is a great convertible laptop for those with general computing needs. It‚Äôs nice and portable, weighing only 2.75 pounds it‚Äôs certainly in the running with the competition of other low cost convertibles out there.

  As an IT Pro for the last 20 years and computer nerd since 1977, I know quality when I get my hands on a device.I bought this for my mother who wanted a simple computer that was portable, affordable, and limited in frustration seeing that she's a computing neophyte like many people.  Admittedly, I'm not all too familiar with Windows 10 S, but know enough about Windows to navigate any other version.  From what I experienced, it's a functional OS environment for people who simply want to use the machine without knowing much about security and other IT mumbo-jumbo.  In other words, I'm saying that it works as it should for an entry level machine that feels well made without the burden of bloatware and other junk most vendors load onto their devices.  The Flex 11 comes straight up with Windows 10 S ready for use straight out of the box -- except for the few minutes you are going to have to spend to get the OS updated via Windows Update.Unlike other machines that have that ""cheap plastic"" feel, this doesn't.  The keyboard is responsive, the hinges have enough tightness with zero play, and it has all the ports you'd need to plug in any peripheral you would need.  The only issue I have with the build is the lack of a ""chamfer"" on the edge of one of the panels to assist in opening the device when it's closed.Don't expect this device to beat any speed records - it falls into that ""Chromebook"" class of 2 in 1 laptops that may outperform many others of its class but again, it's not supposed to be a speed demon with a litany of GPU benchmark records under its belt.  It has all the power it needs to surf online, participate in all the social media tools, and entertain with decent multi-media play.  The audio and video is functional - not the greatest and certainly not the worst.What can I say about a machine that does more than what I expected for $266USD?  It's a fantastic value for the performance, and it feels durable enough to invoke confidence that it can survive the wear and tear that a primary device will endure.

  My previous laptop was getting old so I decided to pull the trigger for this one.  My previous one had a larger screen than this one (15.6""), but I decided to go with a more compact route this time, since I'm only going to use this occasionally when I visit my mother.  It is an adjustment having the smaller keyboard (I'm 5'11 and have long fingers), but that's just part of the tradeoff of having a smaller device.  The shift and backspace keys are proving to be the more difficult ones., and I also miss the number pad I had on my previous one.  The screen is also noticeably smaller, but I don't really mind small font.  I've been using it for about a week and so far the power seems to hold up fine for doing basic tasks like video streaming, internet browsing, and working with excel and word processor.  I like the design, it's simple and sleek, and it has a nice, sturdy feeling to it.  For the price of $325, I'd say it's a good deal - I can see myself easily having this for the next 5-6 years.  A few minor complaints is I don't like Lenovo's rounded keys at the bottom and I would rather have not paid for the extra features of it having a tablet mode or it rotating completely around.  I'm not going to use those features.I did not see a whole lot of options for this size laptop that runs Windows OS and for this price, so I'm glad this one was a good fit.In summary, I would not recommend this for regular/daily use for work or school (I would go a little bigger both for the keyboard size and the size of screen/text), but for occasional use to have around for traveling or recreation, I would certainly recommend.

  So far so good. This is a switch from Mac for me. Seems like great value for the money but wish it came with more instructions. But works well for work which is what it is needed for. Good sound volume and really great picture quality.*Update: less than two weeks later, key fell off and now I can not get in touch with anyone at either Amazon or Lenovo to help. (after days of trying) Wish I would have just stayed to Mac.*Update #2, over a week has gone buy, Amazon reps no help, Lenovo rep no help! I really miss my mac!*update 3: so over a month now, no response to my ticket from Lenovo and still Amazon no help. Have been using sound more and gotta say great for meetings not for movies.Update 4: here we are in October, still no help from amazon or Lenovo. It‚Äôs seriously just needs a new key, usually can buy online for $6 but this one they don‚Äôt sell yet. I even offered to pay for it and can‚Äôt get any help.

  Shipped fast and packed well no damage. Got this for my Mom. All she needed was to check e-mail, view her accounts and play some games. Starts up fast and works great. Just had to re-train my mom on some things and she loves it. I thought the key board was back lit but is not. But that's Ok.

  I purchased this computer for my granddaughter and she really likes it.... the major problem we had was that the company that sold the computer on Amazon...Holiday Express Deal... sent her a 15"" instead of the 18"" we had purchased.  NOT GOOD. The company did provide us with a small refund....but it wasn't the original computer!  This was not an Amazon problem - but rather Holiday Express Deal.

  We ordered this chromebook in April for my son's remote learning.  It was working well at first but two months later something in the lid started moving around and eventually would cover up the front camera!  5 months later we found a mysterious crack by the esc key right above the power supply plug.  Now sometimes the mic doesn't work and the crack is getting bigger, like something inside is swelling up.  We called amazon which hooked us up to Lenovo's tech support department.  They said warranty doesn't cover physical damages and gave us the number to a local computer repair facility who upon calling gets stuck in automated answering selection mode.  I have always been a lenovo fan and we treat this chromebook like gold at home, always on a sturdy laptop stand.  I am very upset that we are now stuck with this chromebook that is falling apart and worried something inside the laptop that's causing the crack will injure my son!  DO NOT BUY!

  Best bang-for-your-buck Chromebook, with the beauty of a high-end yet overly priced Samsung, Asus, or Pixelbook. This little book is perfect in almost every way.In general, this Chromebook is perfect for what I bought it for: work-related tasks on the web, surfing the web, using Google Docs to type up documents & write lyrics for songs, and organizing thoughts and ideas into productivity apps and jotting down tasks in my Microsoft To-Do list app.  This Chromebook is lightning fast in powering up, connecting to WiFi & Bluetooth, and opening apps & browsers.The Screen size is non-jeopardizing; large enough for a functional workspace, but small enough to easily store away in a backpack. Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you're trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It's quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It's back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you're used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don't have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn't been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn't completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.

  Revised - 3/9/21As others have complained, the right hinge for the monitor is defective. I can't open/close the laptop unless I do it very slow using two hands so the monitor would not break. From what all are saying I guess I am SOL. I will contact Lenovo none the less to see if the will fix this.Revised - 9/30/20I must apologize to Lenovo. The issues I was facing was from my own doing. I forgot that I had set the OS to dev mode sometime ago and that was causing the device to act up. After setting the OS back to standard mode, it is running smoothly not freezing once.  All our headache went away.  Back to 5 stars!Revised - 9/24/20Stay AWAY!! Now the sound is going away during my daughter's virtual class.  We need to restart the device in order to get the sound back.  I would stay away from this device if you need something for school.  Our first Chromebook so not sure if this is normal for Chromebook.  Very dissapointed to say the least.Revised - 9/23/20Our device is starting to freeze daily and needing restart.  This is extremely frustrating for my 4th grade daughter when learning virtually.  It is not like she has too many files or apps open so I'm down grading this to three stars.With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14"" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3"" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We'll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I'm still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it's not that difficult.  It's no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of usÔºöÔºâ

  After six months of use the right hinge broke and started flexing the screen out.Looks like a bad design. Lenovo repair has you fill out a repair ticket but no info as where to send it, RMA or any other info.I have laptops that are over four years old and dont have any problems with hinges.*UPDATE* Lenovo fixed the hinge but broke the covers in the processes. Looks like they used a crowbar to pry them off. Took three months to get the unit back.  I would look at the Acer Spin over this.

  I've used quite a few Chromebooks before (Samsung, Pixelbook, Acer, HP). This time I wanted something that had a 14"" Full HD screen and an Intel Core i3+ processor (main for my children to use), but also wanted something that was snappy.For $400, this Chromebook has been impressive and has a solid build and is fairly lightweight.- Keyboard is great with keys nicely placed.- The HD touchscreen is sharp- The unit performs well with a moderate amount of tabs open, streaming two Youtube videos is no problem.- The flip screen is a nice touch- There's a good # of ports as well (dual USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, mini-SD card slot)- The webcam is great for video conferencing (even comes with a neat built-in webcam cover ).- Installing apps from the Google Play store was simple enough.It is a great Chromebook this price point!

  What can I say it‚Äôs just as good as I thought it would be. It‚Äôs well made and very fast! My other laptop that runs windows 10 has a i7, 8GB of ram, and a SSD. This feels just as fast (or faster) for half the price and better portability.

  I purchased a new version of this Lenovo, as opposed to a cheaper ""refurbished"" version for the expressed reason that I did not want to have any possible glitches or crashes.  Unfortunately, as a result, I did not purchase additional warranty securities because I believed it unnecessary.  Then, following no injury, nor incident, nor inappropriate handling of any sort, I attempted to turn on the computer after approximately six weeks of light use (retail internet searches, Word document creation) only to discover that the unit was unresponsive.  When I was able to finally boot up, there were more inoperable keys than operable, and everything was sporadic and unpredictable.I was unable to achieve full operational function of the machine ever again. BEWARE!!!

  Absolutely terrible. I have had this computer for less than 3 weeks, and the hard drive has broken.I haven't dropped it, or had any water or other damage. After working fine all morning, I closed the laptop briefly to walk to another classroom, and when I reopened the laptop it was stuck on the boot menu screen, and no bottoms worked. An IT friend of mine tried a bunch of things, and he advised me that the hard drive has broken and needs to be replaced.This is unbelievable to me considering I have not even had it for a month. I am extremely dissatisfied, and will certainly never recommend this product or Lenovo to anyone.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.

  Let me try to be fair on both sides.Pros:1. This is a <$300 laptop, that is NOT a cloud-based one or a tablet. Meaning, it actually has a SATA hard drive rather than a ~20GB flash memory and a full desktop OS. If you search for laptops around this price range, most found laptops required streaming service because their flash memory is too small to store any practically sized files.2. Also within this price range a lot of the non-cloud laptops have processors worse than an AMD E1, believe me. To be fair for $200+, an low-end AMD processor is about what you can get without compromising too much on other aspects of the laptop.3. 15 inch screen, although only supports half HD (720p)Cons:1. It is slow, by all standards. I am not arguing against that statement. Yet with some optimization and a little bit of patience it is not unusable.2. Made with plastic shell. I understand to cut the cost down some compromising is required but, personally, I cannot withstand the plastic feeling when I first pull it out of the box.3. Graphic card sucks. But hey, the seller made it clear that it has a on-board low-end graphic card.In general, this laptop is the best in its class if: 1. you have a limited budget (<$300), 2. cannot take a laptop that always requires good internet connection to use (chrome book, cloud book, etc.), 3. want a decent sized screen, and most importantly, 4. have some patience, know the physical limitations of the hardware and would only use it for casual use (not 3D gaming, not full HD streaming, and not data calculating).Otherwise, consider something else.

  I returned it because I was under the impression it had Microsoft word on it. I think it had some program but it wasn't what I was looking for. I went into Best Buy because my luck buying computers online hasn't been the best and found out that almost all computers do not come with all the Microsoft products and that is something you have to purchase in addition to the computer. I am not computer literate at all but I wish I would have known this because I would have kept this computer and bought the Microsoft program. It was a good size computer and seemed to be great minus the program's I was looking for.

  Exactly as described. Had a little frustration getting it fully updated, but that's a Windows 7 Pro issue, not the laptop. It's thin, lightweight, runs the software I need it to run. Nice feature is it has a replaceable battery pack (not commonly found in laptops these days). Screen has a fairly wide viewing angle. The full keyboard is nice also, and highly desirable to me.

  I knew it was cheap and probably loaded with unwanted ""software"".  It was simply a backup to a backup.  What I got; a slow, slow, slow, slow laptop that has some interesting quirks.  Hit the G or H key and the keyboard bends down and the computer gives a ""boink"" noise and shuts down.  Pressing any key bends the keyboard since the cheap plastic is slightly thicker than a thick piece of paper.From time to time the damn thing goes ""boink"" and simply shuts down.The ""Dolby Advanced Sound"" is worse than the noise coming from a child's toy.It's hard to believe they could make something this sh***y and sell it as a computer.Next trip it is headed for the shooting range.  I have a Dell on order.

  This is the most horrible laptop I have ever gotten and I just realized why it is so cheap.  Just as everyone else I noticed the CPU staying at 100% right out of the box which makes it impossible to do anything!  I did not even bother uninstalling any Lenovo related software because the laptop was simply unresponsive because it was ‚Äúbusy‚Äù doing something else. I‚Äôve had 12800 4GB stick lying around, so I pop it in, format the C drive and install my own Windows 7 Pro x64 and it did not change a thing‚Ä¶ The machine without any software kept on staying at 65-80% load on the CPU which makes no sense to me. I believe the CPU has a flaw in it and hence they are getting rid of this junk for that cheap.  Besides, the windows I installed off my USB drive (which is known to work well and activate with multiple legit license keys) failed to activate with the license key Lenovo came with.  I called Microsoft and they told me that Lenovo has blocked the key for any further activation‚Ä¶ Then, I called Lenovo Customer Support and after being transferred a couple of times AND having to repeat myself EVERY time, the last representative told me they are lacking in proper training to help me fix the problem.  Besides, they were like: ‚ÄúYou should not install anything on this laptop besides what the laptop came with‚Äù. I LOL‚Äôed.Conclusion: nothing against Lenovo, even though I don‚Äôt think they know what they are talking about, DO NOT buy this laptop, would it be for your grandma or aunt ‚Äì JUST DO NOT BUY IT‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs nothing you can do to take the load off the CPU unless you install Windows 95 on it LOL. It‚Äôs going back to where it came from.

  It came with windows 7 which I wanted, but the screen would auto dim if left on for some reason. Tried every setting but it didn't fix it.Installed windows 10 on it and all of a sudden everything works perfect. IT's even faster. Mother likes her computer now!

  I ordered this laptop so my kids can do their school work and play games on so they wouldn't be on mine. This laptop is so slow it was like we were using dial up internet. They can't look anything up, or play any games no matter what drivers I download to help speed it up. There is nothing saved on this computer so it has plenty of memory and I though it had a big enough processer and RAM to allow for these few tasks. I wouldn't order again. I will stick with HP. You get what you pay for....and I paid a lot for this laptop which is now a paper weight!

  This product came in timely manner, even though it was ordered holiday time. Everything works well besides for 2 issues. I am finding that downloading apps and data goes quickly, but, when more than 4 windows are open, it takes a long time (up to 50 seconds) to load or open a new window. Additionally, the touch screen is NOT touch screen at all. It hasn't worked not once since I bought the product. Either it is a faulty feature or the product sent to me is not the product advertised.

  AMD 4300u CPU (latest gen in 2021), passmark currently at 7749 (which is pretty impressive for a 15w TDP CPU).This CPU is going to be significantly better than any intel Celeron or atom processor in this price range.It also beats out all the price comparable i3 chips by 50-70% - the i3-1005G1has a passmark score of only 5261.This AMD 4300u is a fantastic value at this price range.The integrated graphics are good enough to easily watch 1080p video, and keep up with the demands of Windows. I would not recommend this for any serious gaming.128gb m.2 ssd - would prefer 512gb+ but again, can upgrade this later for a relatively cheap cost. There's only room for one m.2 so it would require replacing the drive and reinstalling Windows (or your operating system of choice).IPS Touchscreen is quite nice, the responsiveness of the touch screen is 'mediocre' but for the cost of the laptop, it's still impressive.Speakers sound good, touchpad is responsive, and keyboard feels good to type on.Build quality feels good and there is a bit of resistance when flipping the screen into tablet mode.Overall for the $447 I paid at the time, it was an excellent deal for a low to mid-end 2 in 1.

  Bought this to replace my acer, which died after 5 years. I have high end notebooks and an ipad at my house, but I like to use these cheap chromebooks (we have two) as daily beaters.First the good. Its a reliable, sturdy computer that was cheap.The bad is that the volume is practically unusable. I basically have to use earphones all the time because the sound is  so low. Second, the wifi performance is substandard. We have very congested wifi here, in silicon valley, and everyone is home because of covid. The lenovo is halting and videos are unwatchable much of the time. It clears up very late or very early, so I know it is wifi congestion. However, if I change to one of my more expensive laptops, there is no issue. I don't know how lenovo managed this.

  I purchased this after I bought a 2 in 1 Windows 10 laptop last year. I like the Chromebook MUCH more. It is easier to navigate (like an Android phone or tablet), starts up INSTANTLY, and has incredible battery life. This particular one has an aluminum chassis and top cover, a glass touch screen, and usb c ports on BOTH sides for charging etc! It is thin, but heavier (aluminum and glass vs  all plastic) It FEELS like a high end laptop and performs like it. 4gb ram and 64gb hard drive is more than most basic Chromebooks. AND you can turn it into a 15.6"" tablet!- and you can play a lot of your favorite games from the Google Play Store! I am glad I bought it .

  This chromebook feels nice and looks good. I loved the feature of it unfolding 360¬∞. When I turned it on, it was a different story. The display is so dark, my eyes hurt to look at the screen. I compared the brightness of the screen on the highest setting with my much much cheaper Acer chromebook. Lenovo was just nowhere near the brightness of the Acer screen. The resolution is too blurry to believe it is 1080.  I also tried to set up this chromebook and it took a while for just 6 apps to download. I was hoping to get something better for this price, but I guess the prices are overinflated on everything due to pandemic and this chromebook is no exception. I believe it isn't worth more than $250 in reality, hence the perfomance. Needless to say the new Lenovo went back.

  We have owned laptops from Toshiba, HP, Asus, Acer and Dell and all of them got slow and outdated over a long period of time but never any issues. So this is the first time buying a Lenovo and had high hopes as they seem like a good brand. So this laptop had light use and bit the dust after only a year and a half.A professional looked at it and tested everything and looks like the motherboard went out on it. Call Lenovo for help and they were no help. They tried to sell me a replacement motherboard for $227.....really? We paid $299 for the laptop and now need to pay almost what we paid for the part???? Come one Lenovo, seriously. Not happy and plan to never use Lenovo ever again.Want to waste money on a laptop that dies after a year and a half? Then Buy a Lenovo

  For a $400 laptop, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. Touch screen works, but viewing angles are garbage (i mean GARBAGE). I also don't know if it's just the one I received, but if I tilt the screen closed, not shut but just halfway down, it considers it CLOSED and shuts down. Very frustrating. Im also having trouble with an error code for Windows updater that I still haven't solved yet- though that probably isn't going to be a problem for everyone.HOWEVER, I was in need of a cheap laptop with a passable processor to use for browsing, word processing, etc and this will certainly work for me. It's not a bad laptop as long as you don't set your expectations too high.

  I needed a computer quick, for school use. The only reason I purchased this one, is because they offered INSTALLMENTS! It does the job. I've had it for 2 months. It doesn't have a 9 key but you can use a usb key board. Speakers are small but loud enough for me.Pros:-Flexible & turns into a tablet-I had to turn S mode off for advanced accounting class but liked it on/off-Works with Blackboard-Installments offered-Compact/easily portable-Not heavy but I would say average-Windows 10 already installed-Touchscreen works goodCons:-Starting to get slow after 2 months but it may be bc I've downloaded a lot for school-Small screen. Says 14"" but looks more like 11""-Price is too high-Only has 2 USB slots-No disc slot for CDs!-Battery should last longer-Dont like using Bing

  Great for the price! Display is where the manufacturer saved some $$ to offer at a lower cost. Not that bad for daily/occasional use. If you require more screen tim I would recommend spending some more $$ for a better display.

  I like the touch screen. But the display is very poor. I want to see my flickr and Instagram photos and they just looked bad on this display. The description says it comes with Windows 10 but in fact it is Windows 10 S mode. It will not allow you to download a Kindle app. I am returning and will come back to let you know how quickly I receive my refund. I got the return authorization within minutes of requesting it and the label printed easily.

  I needed to get a new computer as my OS was no longer going to be supported.  I am not a ""techie"".  My old computer was only 8 years old and I was quite irritated that it was no longer going to be supported/updated. .  One of the selling points of that computer was that it had ""lifetime"" antivirus included.  After much research and reading of others opinions here and on the QVC forums I decided to try a CB. If you are considering a CB, check out a website...ChromeUnboxed.  I did not want to spend big bucks again and I wanted a CB that had the longest life I could afford in my price range.  I have gone from a 17"" Dell Windows Laptop to this 11"" CB.  I love it.  It was an adjustment to the smaller size and navigating the system but for limited daily use to check emails, shop and check accounts etc it meets my needs.  I am not a gamer so that is not something I can speak to.

  Look, when I first got this chromebook, I expected it to be a piece of crap, despite the positive reviews. When it came, I could not apply a screen protector whatsoever. Mainly because this unit already had a screen protector on it. 4 to be exact, so this tells me right away that this wasn‚Äôt brand new. When I booted it right, right away had bubbles in the screen. So I had to remove the screen protectors to stop it from bubbling up. The performance of this laptop or chromebook is sluggish and slow. The set up was so simple that I didn‚Äôt have to do anything really, just type my email in, and everything transferred over like that. When I typed on google docs, Netflix or a random app would start up mid session while typing, which was a hassle. You cannot whatsoever put mobile network on this and solely runs on WiFi. If you use mobile hotspot it isn‚Äôt the most trust worthy as it constantly booted me off. When I tried Google Stadia on this, for the most part it ran well, but with mobile hotspot at McDonald‚Äôs it stuttered a lot. And off of mobile hotspot, couldn‚Äôt play whatsoever. If your planning on gaming on the go, with a mobile network, you will be sadly disappointed if wanting to take this on a dirt road away from WiFi. This is good for Someone who will stay at home or has a great WiFi connection constantly. You can download Netflix movies and watch them without internet, but the sound is awful, and the resolution isn‚Äôt the greatest being sluggish and all. The overall feel of this laptop is there, but it doesn‚Äôt allow certain things to work on it. This isn‚Äôt windows remember, so your awesome headsets or gaming mouse, may not be compatible with this chromebook. Although it looks really cool, to use typing as a writer, I would not recommend it. Typing words sometimes pauses mid type, and doesn‚Äôt respond causing the device to freeze then come back to life again. Not the best device out there for sure, and would recommend not picking it up, unless you are literally not going to take it anywhere but home.

  To best describe the color of this notebook it's a sandy metallic pink.Before this purchase I owned a Toshiba 15 inch from 2012 with full keyboard. If you are willing to learn to switch to save files in cloud form or to USB it will work for you.I installed Microsoft it works well. I'm able to retrieve documents easily. I am able to check emails watch videos on YouTube. I find no lag time and opening new windows in opening applications. Easy navigation. Prints well. Clear screen and good sound. I find no issues and believe it's right for the money.I use it for emails, Zoom, YT, recording video, office duties, etc. No gaming.

  So cute and it‚Äôs PINK!! I‚Äôm love with this little chrome book. Gets the job done. I‚Äôm studying real estate so I have a few quiz apps and real estate apps. Light weight!! Small enough to throw in a tote bag and I just LOVE how it folds all the way back. I have absolutely no complaints. I hope to keep using this once I‚Äôm licensed.

  This device is terrible. It lasts long enough to surpass the return window, but afterwards, it's a piece of junk. It disconnects from WiFi automatically. Every. Single. Time.

  i love this chromebook! I watched some review videos and searched online forever about this model. I finally decided to buy it. It's pretty fast and responsive - i had a hp prior and it was the slowest thing on the planet. This chromebook DOES NOT get mad when i have multiple browsers open at the same time. I always have like 10 open at once lol and it responds great! I love that it flips, i do a lot of digital drawing. It does not work with an active stylus, which blows. I had to use a capacitive stylus. It works fine but is not pressure sensitive when drawing. This is not my main tool so its fine. I will say that the volume isnt incredibly loud - sounds pretty bad, but i use headphones all the time so it doesnt really effect me much. Chromebooks are definitely not for everyone. I bought this for school and work. It will definitely take some getting used to. But i definitely recommend this product and im glad i went with it!

  This review is for the Lenovo ThinkPad 11e 11.6"" notebook.  (Reviews for different models sometimes get grouped together; it's important to know which model is being reviewed so as to avoid confusion).My 11e came with Windows 10 Professional installed on a 128 SSD with 4gb of RAM.  Both the RAM and the drive can be upgraded by removing the bottom panel on the lower clam shell.  I cannot comment on the ease of upgrades, not having performed any.  Edit: I did, however, remove the bottom panel from the lower clamshell (six Philips screws) and found the SSD, RAM chip, and battery all easily accessed.EDIT:  I decided to upgrade the RAM to 8gb.  It's a single chip and requires that the original 4gb chip be removed.  The upgrade was quite easy; remove the six Philips screws, remove the old chip, insert the new chip, replace the six Philips screws, done.  I have not noticed any increase in performance; this upgrade was done because I noticed that with a number of Chrome tabs open and Office Excel and Outlook open the available RAM was getting quite low.  The RAM was $40 from Amazon.¬†

  Pros:- Windows 10 Pro x64- 4GB RAM-128GB SSD- Celeron Quad-Core (what??)- Bluetooth / AC Wifi- Lightweight- 6+ hours battery life- Minimal bloatware- Decent keyboard feel- Screen Mirroring works- Sound qualityCons (very few minimal cons at this pricepoint):- Only two USB ports- No physical wifi switch (dedicated hotkey though)- Hotkey FN button disabled out of box but keys workI picked this up on an impulse buy last week. This was on sale for $199. I know PCs and this was a steal at that price and is still a great deal at the currently listed price of $270. I have a custom built desktop for gaming and everything else at home and a bunch of workstations at work but I lacked an ultra-portable. The main use for this will be as a backup in case something goes wrong with my home PC (need to be able to get work and school work done) and to take with me on trips if needed. It's also nice to be able to do homework or light browsing somewhere other than the home office.What I like about it -The laptop has some great hardware specs (true quad-core!) and runs Win 10 effortlessly. It's not a powerhouse but it's definitely a few steps above your average Chromebook or under-powered ""netbook"" that you can get for the same price. Very little bloatware came installed. I removed McAfee and a few Lenovo add-ons that weren't necessary for normal operation of the hardware / software. Took maybe 20 minutes to go through. There are a few things you'll want to keep so don't go uninstalling anything that says Lenovo (will update and provide a list later). Battery life states 6+ hours on full charge. With the screen at 25% brightness, the estimated jumped to 7 hours 22 minutes. Impressive. The design is simple and functional. Nothing too flashy. The bottom of the laptop and the bezel for the lid is coated in this grippy texture that makes it nice for use on your lap or other sloped surface. It doesn't slide.What I dislike about it -I use the term dislike very loosely here but the only thing I noticed that wasn't right was that the hotkeys did not work out of the box. There are an assortment of functions like volume, screen brightness, wifi off/on, etc. that can be controlled by pressing the Fn key and another key but none of them worked for me. Not a big deal since I use the controls within the OS primarily. Still something I will investigate further. **EDIT - so as of week or so ago, I discovered that the hotkey options in the BIOS were set to disable the Fn key and just use F1 - F12 as hotkeys. I switched it back to what I am accustomed to (Fn + punction key for hotkey function) and all is well. There are also options to switch the CTRL and Fn key which I may still use since the Fn key is in a weird spot.Only two USB ports available, with at least one being USB 3.0.Other uses:- This will be an outstanding student laptop if what you want an actual PC to do homework, browsing, media playing and maybe light (very light) gaming.- It's also just a great little PC to have in place of a Chromebook or even a tablet if you're considering a portable device. Windows 10 (and Windows 8 / 8.1) have screen mirroring technology built into the OS so as long as your hardware supports it (most new devices will) you can mirror the device's screen on a smart TV or other smart display.All in all, this is a great deal and you should buy it while you can, even at $270.**EDIT** - So as promised, I went back and made a list of the bloatware that I removed in case someone could benefit from it.Software Removed:- McAfee (should be self explanatory as to why I removed it. Windows Defender (aka - Microsoft Security Essentials) is perfectly fine as an antivirus / antimalware SCANNER. If you want live internet security you want a better full security suite like Bitdefender Internet Security.- Active Protection System (only needed for a HDD, safely stops HDD if the laptop is dropped, not necessary for SSD).- Lenovo Quick Optimizer (""toolbar that allows the user to view computer optimization status, quickly optimize the computer, and launch the Lenovo Companion universal app."" So in other words, it allows you to manage PC status like temp files, settings that can be done from elsewhere. To me it's unnecessary and redundant if I can do these functions in the OS so I removed it.).- Lenovo Battery Gauge (simple battery gauge that can go on the task bar. Windows already has one so I removed).- REACHit (a cloud service from Lenovo for storing and managing data. I like simplicity so I have one Google account to store important data and that uploads my pictures from mobile regularly. No need for another product that does the same thing, removed).- Lenovo Experience Improvement (feedback tool for Lenovo. I can submit feedback and bug reports on my own, I don't need an added program to do that, removed).Software Kept:- Lenovo On Screen Display (displays hotkey status as a message on the screen. Have yet to get hotkeys to work but the messages do work for caps lock button)- Lenovo Power Management Driver (probably only needed to use the built-in Lenovo power profile but I kept it just in case. It doesn't look like it uses many resources if any.)- Lenovo System Interface Foundation (have yet to evaluate this one but apparently it is tied to Lenovo Companion so that it can access the MS app store. I don't think I'll use the app store so I may remove both. Kept for now though).

  This is for the Windows 10 Pro version of the Lenovo 11E.  Purchased for $199.First impressions taking it out of the box:- Very well built- Looks very industrial/business oriented- Lots of portsAfter starting it up and using it:- Great keyboard feel (feels better than a Mac Book Pro's by far) and good keyboard layout- Comes with Windows 10 Pro which enables a lot more functionality for businesses.  A Windows 10 Pro license costs about as much as this laptop - and this laptop comes with it!- Decent performance.  I was expecting a dog slow computer for $199.  Nope - this actually works quite well.  Installed Office365 full version on it and it handles it very nicely.- 4GB Ram + 128GB SSD is great for this price!- Dedicated Ethernet port.- Wireless works great.  No problems with connecting and staying connected.- Windows 10 works great.  No issues at all and it seems quite fast.Downsides:- The screen.  - It's small and really doesn't 'pop' with colors.  Quite unsaturated look to it.  However, it is clear and easy to view.  - Not a touchscreen.Overall:Still can't believe this thing was $199.  I'd buy it again at $299.*Edit:  Added additional details.

  Even with only 4 GB of ram it's really fast. Because it's a Window Home, I switched it from Windows 10 s back to Home and everything is great. The speakers on this model are way-way better than most, even better than many more expensive models.

  i had been hearing good things about amd's ryzen mobile and i already knew the leno flex was durable this line up is no different i am extremely impressed for the cost this thing is runnin notch for notch with my 1st gen core i7 desktop (better in many areas) im even able to play yester years games at doable frames (newz mostly) and it looks fantastic this touch screen is surprisingly crisp and clean to play on. only gripe is the fixed ram i bought mine with a 16 gig upgrade felt rather sheepish when i opened her up in front of the wife and found soldered ram lol.  anyone wtb a ram stick?  alright ive seriously never dished like this in a review before im sorry if your still reading this lol.. i literally felt obligated, tryin to explain to the wife how we need a 2nd one currently the experience was that good lol.  i know if i read this one id say payed actor in my head but this was really my experience.  dunno about leno's other products but flex is awesome in my book

  *UPDATED Review Further Down*Be warned nothing against Amazon but the laptop seller (Lenovo Sold By: M-X-C Tech) sent me dead on arrival software. This computer started up slower than any computer I've personally owned and when it started it stayed at the ""Lenovo"" start up screen constantly replaying the words ""Diagnosing your PC"" and ""Preparing Automatic Repair"". I tried troubleshooting (F11, F12 etc) and I tried Contacting **Lenovo Tech Support** Support told me they'd fix the computer for $99. When I said ""That's more than a third of what I paid for the Laptop so I think I'll go ahead and return it instead"" the agent simply said ""I think you should return it too"" that's it.Terrible all around purchase. Dead Laptop. Even for the low price of $249 this deal was a bust. Please be warned you're rolling the dice on this purchase.** Update: I was later able to get to the BIOS myself and restore the computer. Had I not known how to fix this issue this still would have warranted a return however.A big issue I had when I finally got this laptop going was the amount of ""bloat ware"" on the Laptop. I used IOBit Uninstaller and spent 1-2 hours uninstalling and updating programs on the laptop only then after would I give this 3 stars just for the sheer work involved with stabilizing it.

  For $258 (I paid) this laptop is more that enough.  Let's go through to good and bad.Construction:  Cheap plastic but one cannot expect much.  Everything feels solid but you definitely notice that the best materials were not used.  They keyboard actually moves up and down as you type, as if there is empty space under it.  Keystrokes are not as smooth as I would like and the right shift key is small.  There is no separation between the directional keys which causes incorrect key presses.  The touchpad is a rough texture but responsive.  It is overly sensitive to movement as you are typing which throws you off.  Also for some odd reason all the F-keys are set to require pressing the Fn button.Processor:  You get a 2.0 GHz that boosts to 2.4GHz.  For comparison I have a i7 quad core that boosts to 3.2 GHz but this computer performs surprisingly fast!  Even better, it runs much cooler.  I didn't feel any warmth under it even when running intensive graphics. My i7 with a 750M ran super hot.Graphics:  The R5 is no powerhouse but believe it or not this thing can actually run Fallout 4!  Yes, you heard correctly.  Now don't get excited because you must run it at low settings and windowed mode for best speed.  However, my i7 could only max out at medium settings which says a lot for this laptop.  I also paid $700 more for that i7 laptop (Sony SVF15328CXB).  The downside is that this laptop only has 1366x768 resolution which is not impressive at all.  An R6 would probably make this laptop a bit more valuable.  Expect to run Fallout 3 or Skyrim just fine on this.To be fair, I did mod this system a bit.  I put an extra 4GB Ram in it.  It has two slots.  I also IMMEDIATELY wiped the system and put Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate on it.  It comes with Windows 8.1 which is a disaster by itself.  However with all the bloatware it's even worse.  Windows 10??? Bleh.. I'll stay off that subject less we start an argument.  BE WARNED the Wireless driver on Lenovo is the WRONG driver!  I guess they are too lazy to put up the correct driver even after people have posted the problem in their forums.  Do a quick google search for it and you'll find the correct one (62f001fw) .[...]Battery & Power:  3 hours max.  Half that if you are playing games.  It also has a square AC plug which is unlike other plugs.  So if you lose the charger, don't expect to use a universal.Bottom Line:With a little upgrade this thing runs fabulous.  With an SSD, I'm sure it will run even better.  For the price, you cannot beat it.

  I was looking to replace a 4 year-old Asus netbook for as little as possible, since I do not have any real income at the moment. The netbook has been put through a lot and still works fine, but the 10 inch screen, single core processor and 2 GB of RAM were just too limiting. Given my extremely small budget, I looked around and researched different models (I always spend a lot of time obsessing over every bit of information I can find before I make a purchase!) for a while before finding a Lenovo G50 laptop for about $350. Looking around a bit more, I stumbled across this model which was almost $100 cheaper and all I could find for the difference was a little less RAM. For that difference, I could upgrade the RAM and buy a few extra things like a case and still save.I didn't have a lot of needs: bigger screen and keyboard as well as more processing power were the main concerns. I do some writing and online work, as well as the occasional gaming.  I also like to watch movies and shows on my computer, so a large hard drive would be beneficial. This model seemed to do everything I needed and a bit more.Keeping my eye on it, I was surprised to see it going for $220 one day. Luckily I had the money so I went ahead and ordered it, and made an order a few days later when I had the extra money for an additional 4 GB RAM module (Kingston Technology 4GB 1600MHz DDR3L PC3-12800 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/4), an Amazon Basics case and a couple of favorite PC games.The laptop was ordered on a Wednesday night and arrived in brand new shape Saturday around noon -- excellent value for $7.99 shipping. It was packaged well. I had fears that for the money, it might be an open box unit or something -- but no! It was factory sealed. I ordered from Tazwell and couldn't have asked for better service!It came with Windows 8.1 which I had never used, as my netbook had been upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 and I had gotten use to the new OS, which I liked. Windows 8.1 by comparison seemed a little clunky. I didn't like the Metro menu and getting to apps was a little cumbersome. Other things like the charms were unnecessary and had a habit of getting in my way more than helping. Eventually I reformatted and installed Windows 10, which seems to make things better overall. I also doubled the RAM, although I don't notice much of a difference yet.First impression is that the thing is a bit bigger than I expected. But going from a tiny netbook to this was quite a difference. The plastic seems a bit flimsy, especially on the underside and the space around the monitor. There's a bit of give in the keyboard as well, but not terribly. But I think the unit will hold up as long as it is moved and stored with care. It's very thin, having about an inch of height which is great for portability.My netbook had suffered a hard drive failure so I had installed a solid state drive which breathed new life into the unit. This laptop obviously has a regular disc hard drive, and it's noticeably slow in booting and when starting applications. I hope to upgrade to a solid state eventually but for now, it's perfectly acceptable. Upgrading the hardware is a cinch; simply unscrew a large panel from underneath the unit and from there, you can install RAM and/or change out the hard drive. There were a few more components that I had access to, but since I was only concerned with RAM at the moment,  I neglected to see what those were.Overall, the screen is just alright. There are some instances of color banding and sometimes web pages and video will look a bit washed out. Scrolling up and down on webpages tends to blur things a little bit, but I don‚Äôt know if that's the nature of laptops in general or something I can adjust. The keyboard is decent, for the price, but there is some space below the buttons which is a concern for debris. The buttons also feel a little cheap but nothing that I think will break soon. The touchpad is also just acceptable, although there have been a few times when it seems to act like it's doing some things on it's own, like not moving smoothly and then jumping around. It‚Äôs unusable at that point and requires a reboot or using the function keys to disable and enable it several times. There are two buttons below it, and the right one seems to ""dip"" inward on the end a little more than the others. But they are responsive. The USB ports on the left side are a little too close together and I was unable to plug both a USB drive and a wireless mouse dongle into that side. So you may want to opt for a hub. Doing a fresh install of Windows 10 helped cut down on the boot time and increase overall performance. It does come with a lot of bloatware although it isn't quite as bad as I had read, and some of the applications, like PowerDVD, were actually pretty handy. Since I did a complete format, I don't know if I can obtain that particular software from Lenovo since I haven't checked yet. But both Media Player Classic and VLC Player are capable of playing DVDs as I alternate between the two for viewing downloaded videos. The headphone jack is on the right hand side and very close to the front of the unit, which can be problematic while using a mouse if you have very limited desktop space like I do. The included DVD writer was on the slow side as far as reading, but again this is a budget laptop. I haven't burned any discs yet so I can't comment on it's speed there.*Just a note about the touchscreen. I saw where someone has complained about the lack of a scroll bar. While this is correct, you can press two fingers to the pad and scroll up and down on webpages. Moving your fingers apart will allow you to either zoom or unzoom on pages. It also registers five finger touches but I am not yet sure what purpose that would serve.I installed and ran a few games, such as Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway and STALKER, and they run well and look great on the unit. Fallout 3 I thought might give it some trouble, but no. That game also runs extremely well at default settings. The unit never gets hot; just a little warm during gaming. At first I was concerned since I have yet to hear a fan, but when I went to update the BIOS, that reassured me as the fan spun up to what I imagine is its highest setting and it was pretty loud. Using GPU-Z (a program for providing detailed specs on the graphics chip), I noticed it seems to think the integrated Radeon GPU has about 1 gig of dedicated memory (this was after the 4 GB RAM upgrade; before it indicated 512 MB). I realize this is shared with the main RAM, but I was under the impression that the graphics chip could use up to 4 GB if needed. That still may be the case and it could be a limitation of the program itself as the GPU may take more memory if the demand is great enough, such as when playing graphics-intensive games. There just seemed to be a few other differences between what GPU-Z tells me and the information about the Radeon chip on the internet. I may read up more and see if I can get additional information on the discrepancy, but again, for the budget this laptop runs older games perfectly.I don't have a need for many programs, but the ones I use, such as Open Office and Photoshop CC, started up and ran decently fast.It has a few nice little bells, like a USB 3.0 port, an HDMI-out, a card reader and Bluetooth. I don't know if this is standard for laptops nowadays, but I also like that the F-keys (functions 1 through 12) are for quick actions like adjusting volume, brightness, disabling touchscreen, etc. There is an 'FN' key on the bottom row of keys that you'll need to hold down in order to actually use 'F1' through 'F12'. I greatly prefer that, as quick adjustments have been something I tend to use a lot more than any of the 'F' keys, especially for gaming and watching videos. I do not think there is a function lock key however, for those that may need them. If you really need the function keys as they were, you can go to BIOS and adjust the 'hotkey' settings there. In order to get to the full BIOS, you'll need to press the ""one key"" button on the side of the unit. I do wish there was a way to do that without having to go through BIOS, especially since I love those very old X-Wing/TIE Fighter games which needed those function keys for important gameplay control. Even better would have been a ""function lock"" on the keyboard itself.So far, I am very pleased with the unit. It's a substantial upgrade from my netbook, and for the money I don't think I could have found a better deal. It fulfills all of my basic, albeit rather undemanding needs and it's a nice bonus that it can run some of my favorite older games. It isn't built like a tank by any means, but considering what I paid for it, I feel it will last a good while as long as I am careful. I plan on still using my netbook for other things, so that will cut down on wear. I am very pleased with the purchase as well as how fast it was shipped. I don't think things could have gone any more smoothly. Thanks again, Tazwell, for an excellent product at an excellent price and with equally excellent shipping. Now that I upgraded the RAM and Windows, the unit seems to be exactly what I need and I am very satisfied with everything.*Just a quick note on upgrading. As I mentioned, I chose to do a clean install of Windows 10, which completely erases all of the information on the hard drive. I used a USB flashdrive to install Windows, so hitting either the 'escape' or 'F12' (sorry, can't remember which) key at bootup and choosing the second option will allow it to boot from USB. Lenovo has partitioned off about 25 GB that contains drivers and, oddly enough, just one program (McAfee). Anyway, after installing Windows 10 and getting to the desktop, it couldn't locate the wireless adapter. Considering you need that so Windows can update your software (such as for the wireless adapter!), I got a little worried. On a whim,  I went into that Lenovo partition and installed the wireless drivers from there, which fixed the problem and allowed it to connect online and download the necessary updates and proper drivers. The unit has a network cable connection, so that could be a second option for needing to connect online when installing and updating.

  This was purchased primarily as a home laptop for the wife to surf the web, e-commerce, minor research.  We do not do gaming.  We found the laptop to have a nice sleek appearance.  It was easy to follow instructions for set up.  There were no down sides to this purchase.  We have now used for about 2 months and all is very good.  We have no complaints as to speed, memory size, etc.

  We purchased this Laptop on 7/16/2018  from Amazon, and it arrived 7/19/2018. We had a startup problem in January, 2019 and called Leveno. We were informed that we were out of warranty. Upon investigation, this product warranty started when it shipped to Etech Galaxy on 6/9/2017. That meant that when we ordered the product, it was out of the one year warranty upon purchase. We have been trying to get the warranty adjusted with Lenovo, but have been unsucessful so far. I have talked with Amazon and Etect Galaxy with no positive results.

  I really like that this computer is lightweight, I don't have a touch screen, which is fine. The only issues I have with it though, it is a little slow, and it heats up to the point of the fan being on, and the fan is very loud.Other than that, I love it! Arrived on time, easy to set up. Not bad for a refurbished computer. Although, the price is a little too high, I thought it was a new computer, but, I can deal with that.Thank you!!

  I got this especially to use in my Amateur Radio applications. So far it seems to be doing good. I purchased the upgraded model with 12 GB Ram and 512 GB M.2 solid state drive. It boots from shut down in about 15 seconds (I haven't timed it). It also does not seem to have a lot of bloatware installed on it and I find that a great plus. So far everything seems good but I'm  sure there will be little things that I find as I go along I do not care. One of the things I like best is the fact it has an intel processer, one of my least liked things is the O/S which is Windows,  however there are lots of Amateur radio programs that just won't work well it at all with Apple so that is why I opted for this machine.

  At first I was very happy with my purchase, except I was concerned the package seal had been broken before I received the box.  I began having problems within hours of turning on my new laptop. The space bar only responded part of the time. I started having boxes pop up asking me to do this or do that, and not being an expert, I tried to decipher if these were from Microsoft or Lenovo before accepting or rejecting. By the third day, I was having major problems. The laptop was no longer able to detect my wireless internet, even though my old laptop in the same room was picking up the signal just fine. The audio quit, and troubleshooting said it was a registry issue. System restore said it was not working. Windows Security Service was not working. And so on... I am not a computer expert, and when I buy something I need it to work at least for the manufacturer's warranty period, and preferably long after.  My old laptop here is almost 6 years old, and I've never encountered any of these issues with it. This one is 3 days  old.  I had to send it back.  I didn't have a chance to find out if this laptop would have been great or not.

  I've had it for a good few weeks now, and the only issue that I have with it is that the track pad kind of spazzes out randomly, which I think it's because I hit a combination of keys and all of a sudden everything I do on the trackpad makes me zoom in on webpages lol. That's really the only issue.Before I bought this a lot of the reviews I read had complaints about the keyboard and monitor.For me personally, I love the keyboard just fine. I'm a very fast typer as it is and it does me just fine.The moniter does seem slightly dull in daytime, but that's to be expected.The speakers did throw me off at first, I'd say they don't sound as great as my last laptop just because of where these speakers sit but it's not horrible either. (plus I use earbuds half the time so it wouldn't bother me in the first place.)I bought this computer to fit my gaming needs, and since I didn't have the money for more expenses models, this was the best one I could find for under 500 dollars.I play World of Warcraft at about medium/some high settings and I range from 30-70 fps just depending on whats going on.Of course in PVP and raids I'd suggest lowering everything as far as it can go just because those modes are very demanding.League of Legends is at I believe max settings, except I turned shadows off and sometimes I can get up to 65-70 fps, but it generally stays around the 50-60 area, and sometimes 45 if some crazy stuff is going down.I tried to push this laptop for some higher up games like Archeage and Warframe, which are a lot more graphically intense.It runs Warframe on very low but with 50-60 fps, so if you wanted prettier settings and are okay with sacrificing some frames then there's totally some room for that.Archeage on the other hand didn't really work for me.It did run on low, but in bigger areas there was some pretty hardcore lag especially with heavy player traffic.But when I bought this laptop I didn't expect it to play everything so that's perfectly fine with me.My biggest wants were to play WoW, LoL, and Warframe at smooth and enjoyable frames which I'd say I accomplished.If you are looking for an affordable laptop that can game today's popular games, like League of Legends, then this is totally worth it.I'm 100% happy with my purchase.

  I love the size of this computer. The mouse is very responsive and the added numerical key pad is very nice. It seems to respond fast enough for me. Dump the bloat ware and do any updates.As far as the feel , fit and finish. The outer plastic cover feels very flimsy and cheap, I can actually push on the edge of the screen an it pops in and out of place. The key board is very well built and comfortable and the screen is large and clear.The sound although marketed as Dolby is terrible. Quite and the speakers are located under the keyboard so if its on your lap you can't hear anything. I would recommend this computer for students or for streaming ect.

  This was the hardest laptop ever to get up an running.  It functioned ok, but I had to change numerous default settings (mouse was entirely too sensitive, didn't autoload photos from an SD card,etc.)  The keyboard is very difficult - the page-up and page-down keys are in inconvenient locations, the function keys don't default to the F-functions for excel.  Obviously, I'm not in love with it, but I decided to keep it now that I have it all set-up, but it took me a few weeks to get it to where I wasn't frustrated every time I used it.  Updated later... still really wouldn't recommend this, and I have lowered my rating.  The mouse pad regularly (at least 1-2 times per use) changes the zoom size of my page on chrome or excel.  The mouse often doesn't follow my finger on the pad well.

Its not a gaming laptop, so don't expect peak performance for this, but it will run all the games I have (WOW, Elder Scrolls Online, Diablo 3) at great speed and with impressive graphics.

  Has some good educational Microsoft programs. But I'm almost 100% sure the laptop I was sent was a return. The box had several other shipping tags below mine that I could slightly read. There was no plastic to peel off as all new products have. I inquired about my concerns to the 3rd party company but they said it was new, 1 of a bulk purchase order. Old box may have been used. Started off working ok. Seemed slow for being brand new, internet (high speed) wasn't as expected. The screen started to black out, a white line appeared and it went back to the home screen. Fortunately my 30 days was not up and we sent it back. After getting my shipping labels,  WHICH ARE NOT PREPAIDED, BEWARE, I sent an email to the company.

  This computer is horrible. I work off of a remote desktop, so I don't keep any files on it, and it is still SO SLOW. It cannot handle the microsoft office suite at all. It's very slow to load up, and then load all the programs. I am routinely late to Zoom calls because this stupid machine is stalling. ARE YOU LISTENING COMPUTER? YOU SUCK!I had a Lenovo at my last job and it was a dream. This performs worse than my Acer notebook. Keep looking.

  This is a great laptop and worth the money.  Has windows 10 and easy to sign on and download programs.  No problems at all.  The only thing I'm not too happy about is the battery life.  If that's all I have to worry about, no problem.

  Bought this for my wife as an upgrade to her 6 year old laptop from another mfr. This is much faster and has a great looking screen. The data transfer app made setup a breeze and pulled over all of her photos, documents, bookmarks, etc. from her old machine. Happy wife, happy life, so I am very satisfied with my purchase

  This laptop is very new but so far I'm happy. Seems very quick, keyboard and track pad are comfortable, easy set up. Quick trip out of S-mode. Delivery was earlier than scheduled. I have had HPs and Toshibas, but this is my first Lenovo and so far I like everything about it.UPDATE 12/10/2020--Unfortunately the laptop stopped charging the battery within a week of receiving it. I returned it, shipped back at my own considerable expense. I received a refund for the purchase itself but was out over $40 for shipping it back. It appears failure to recharge is something that happens from time to time with Lenovo so it will be my last Lenovo. Probably an infrequent problem, but I can't recommend it.

  A very nice laptop has good enough battery life and a very nice build, the screen quality is a bit low for a 2020 laptop but its fine, the processor is pretty snappy i wouldn't bother doing gaming though since it does not have great dedicated graphics but overall its a great computer definitely recommend it for the price.

  I bought this laptop for myself and I absolutely love it! It has given me zero problems, and I love that the screen is also a touchscreen. The battery life is fine, it‚Äôs just like any other laptop battery life really. Its slim, and lightweight, so very easy to pack up & take anywhere with you. I use this laptop for mostly personal use, but I could easily use it for business reasons as well. This is my first laptop I‚Äôve ever purchased brand new for myself, and I have no complaints about this product so far and would highly recommend it! Lenovo has good customer service as well if you would have any questions or problems.

  In the picture,  my old ASUS laptop is on the left, bought new for $600 in 2019. The new 2020 Lenovo on the right, for $499. I needed to replace my ASUS due to a manufacturing defect, and decided I needed something a little larger.Comparing the Lenovo to the ASUS-- Lenovo is much faster even though it has around the same specs as the ASUS. Loading webpages, opening programs, etc. is almost instant on the Lenovo.- My biggest issue with my ASUS is that it would easily overheat if my screen was too bright or I overwhelmed the CPU fan and it made this awful grinding noise, I have yet to experience any overheating issues with the Lenovo even with running webpages, videos, games, and over programs at once.- The keyboard buttons do look cheaper since they aren't backlit like on the ASUS, but I find the keyboard overall to be much easier to see and use on the Lenovo, the number pad on the right is a great addition as I use my laptop for work as well as gaming.- The screen on the ASUS does seem to be better quality picture as it's more of a touchscreen glass, and the Lenovo screen is more of a traditional laptop screen. However, both touchscreen work just was well, and I feel like I found see as many finger marks as I do on the glass screen.- The sound quality and loudness is much better on the Lenovo, like, super loud.- Even though these two laptops are vastly different sizes, they weigh about the same. I find the larger screen on the Lenovo also easier to see, as the ASUS is only 13"".All in all, I am pleasantly surprised with how well the laptop works. Along with the expedient shipping and care put into packaging. Good warranty terms as well. Over one month in and everything is still working as good as the first day, let's hope it keeps working that way!

  The laptop is great; however, the Windows 10 S Mode prevents installing software not found in the Microsoft Store. Nevertheless, the S Mode can be disabled for installation of non-MS apps.Still, I bought is as a gift for my wife, and she loves it... So I love it! ;)

  So this computer randomly crashes. If my husband wasn't an IT guy, the computer would not have made it this far and I've only had it for 4 months. That's pretty sad. It's crashed at least 6 times. I only use the computer for work and my studies. I don't download anything crazy or out of the ordinary. I will never buy this brand again. Very sorely disappointed. They should just stop selling it.

  Much thinner than the Lenovo we purchased in 2013 because it no longer has a DVD player (which I kind of miss). Very fast. Slot for camera card is shallow but functions fine.

I'm not a gamer, I simply wanted a laptop to perform basic online research and write papers. Nope -- this is not a good model. Slow response time.

  DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!  I bought this a month ago and have been trying to set the mousepad TAPS feature off.  The settings for mousepad TAPS has been removed so it cant be turned off.  Trying to work is really aggravating when you remove your finger from the pad and touch it again to continue to move the cursor, it clicks anything its pointing to, opening applications and links!!!!  I called the manufacturer over this issue, and they want to charge me to be able for them to install a patch to correct it!!!  When I asked why I have to pay to fix an error this product, he asked me if I asked the retailer if this computer had the capability of turning TAPS off!!  Representative will not let you speak to a supervisor, or give out their headquarters' number!  Again, DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!

  This is our first Lenovo laptop. We're not impressed with the battery life. I think it might go 4 hours but we're usually plugged in so it doesn't matter.

  I ordered this because my old Lenovo laptop (2010 model) finally kicked the bucket. Compared to my old one, this laptop is an absolute beast for the price. It feels much quicker than some of the ones I‚Äôve been able to get my hands on. The battery life is really good and it charges surprisingly fast. The color scheme is also a nice touch, I really like the flat gray with a matte or satin finish to it. The keys feel really nice, and the typing experience is smooth and comfortable. The pad is really responsive and smooth to the touch, it‚Äôs a breeze to operate. My only recommendation is to wash your hands before using it if you‚Äôve just eaten something greasy (fries, burger, etc) because it does leave little marks on the finish easily. However with a small washrag and a tiny bit of water these marks come off without much trouble. I‚Äôve been using the laptop to take summer classes online through my college, and it handles it well. All in all, I‚Äôd recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a great ‚Äúbang for your buck‚Äù laptop.

  I have recently moved all my work over to G Suite because I use Google voice to text a lot, so I wanted to see if I could get away with doing most of my work tasks on a Chromebook. Turns out that with SAS Studio installed in a virtual box through the integrated Linux terminal, that I totally can. I am amazed. My last straw moment with my Windows machine were the sorts of things that everyone is annoyed by: slow startup, updates that fail to install correctly, and machines that just run slower and slower with every update that does install correctly. I was officially done when Microsoft pushed an ""OMG you must do this NOW"" security update outside of my designated update time with zero warning. That happened on my primary machine 20 minutes before giving one of the biggest webinars of my career.  Never, ever, ever again Microsoft. You're dead to me.I wanted this 8 GB RAM machine since Google is now doing 8 years of support from the time the product is introduced to the market, in hopes of prolonging the device's useful life. It feels little like overkill, but came in really handy last week when I had over 40 browser tabs open trying to score a vaccine appointment. Not even a hiccup. The keyboard is super comfortable to type on, and the trackpad works well. I bought the iPlume USI stylus and that works perfectly as well. I use my Logitech trackball mouse with IR dongle and my old school USB ergonomic keyboard with this with no problems. The only software hiccup I've had so far are with backspacing on Facebook messenger. I'm also not a fan of Zoom on chromebook (no option for face tuning, backgrounds etc), and Microsoft 365's web based PPT has a really awful presenter view. But those are problems on the software side and I'm not blaming Google for that. I just mention it since we are all using PPT on Zoom these days. I am treating the hinges of this machine carefully since that seems to be where this machine fails most often. So far, so good (knock on wood).

  This is a great performing laptop to use for web browsing, and media consumption.  Movies, youtube, twitch, even some games.  So far the battery life has been amazing on this unit.  I have purchased both options.  I picked up 1 unit  with the standard 4GB/64GB and 1 with the 8GB/128GB options for me and my wife.  Both of them are performing very well and we've had no issues with them at all.  These work really well with the chromebook USB-C docking bays so we can just plug in our USB ports and charge while we're connected to monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers.  They perform better than I expected.  The convertible/tablet form factor is very convenient for games and touch screen apps.  We've been very impressed with this chromebook.  The fan can be noticeable at times, but it's not a real issue.  The speakers are nice and loud for the size of this unit.  Screen quality , clarity, colors are excellent.  Highly recommended.

  It's pretty fast with tons of storage. I'd be fine with the mediocre screen and audio quality, and even the sense that it'll break easily, but then the touchpad just stopped responding to taps or clicks. Rebooted, started working for another minute or so then stopped again. Lenovo won't do a thing for me except make me ship it to them for ""repair"" -- got the sense if it's a software problem I'm SOL. Big fail -- returning immediately.

  ¬†I never write reviews but I believe it is necessary in this instance as I'm not a computer expert and Amazon and its associates are quick to threaten their customers with account freezes for returning items which do not meet customers satisfaction. This Lenovo IdeaPad will not allow Microsoft edge or word document (except through Google Docs which also closes constantly making me open multiple pages at the same time, ridiculous!) no matter how hard I try to circumvent it including using the Linux Beta software. These apps and documents are necessary for work. Amazon IT helpdesk was a joke where I wasted one hour without any resolution. So, Lenovo is on its way back to Amazon. I will continue searching. Thanks.

With the onboard 64GB eMMC and a Samsung 128GB 100MB/s (U3) MicroSDXC EVO Select Memory Card, I have all the storage I need for the things I do on this computer. At only $170, it is great value for the price.

  I use a $3000 mobile workstation from Dell on a day to day basis and this battery blows the Dell to pieces. Obviously the Dell is pulling way more power. The point is, the little guy will stream hours of video on a charge and doesn't bleed off power in sleep mode like some Windows 10 tablets I sell.For the money, the size and battery are awesome. I don't push the hardware, so I can't speak to much to that.

  For well under $200 this laptop is adequate. It comes with Windows 10 Pro Education and a full HD 1080p display.  The AMD processor is pretty slow and you cannot expand the memory or replace the storage. USB C charging is a plus.

  So far, so good. I have a nine year-old Toshiba with updated windows 10 and it still working with a slow boot up. This laptop boots pretty fast and no problem installing IE11 which is not loaded in favor of Edge. I added Firefox and Chrome and no problems with either. A great deal for $168.

  Product is nice, however, the battery life is draining really fast, not 10 hours, more like 4. I shut down the laptop with half the battery life 2 times, and when I turned it back on the following day, the battery was dead. Battery seems not to be holding the charge.Also, no backlit keyboard as expected.

  This thing is complete garbage. I bought it for my dad, and I spent an hour setting it up, but it immediately disabled the touchpad (as in completely wiped it from the system). Any effort to restore it failed, so I had to do a complete reset on it just to get back one of the most basic features of any such device.This is the last time I will ever buy a Lenovo product. Not remotely worth the frustration.

  The 10th gen i3 gets the job done. We're not using it for gaming; just needed a replacement for my wife's aging Chromebook. It's super snappy and smooth with everyday web browsing, Office app usage, etc. I do wish they put a backlight in the keyboard, but not a deal breaker. Have also seen a few reviews online complaining about screen ""wash out"" but we have seen none of that. I'm not sure how many people use their laptops outside.. the brightness is perfect indoors but no clue how it would perform outside (not something we'll ever need). Good purchase, great seller.

  I don't know if I got a lemon, but this was a terrible computer. The usb drives quit working. The computer was extremely slow. I would delete some of the bloatware, only for it to find it's way back on the machine. I would create a system restore point, only to have it disappear when I would try to restore to that time. I could only do a factory restore, that would then add all the deleted software back on. It also didn't resolve the failed USB drives.

  I purchased this Lenovo in March 2020 and on July 24th 2020 it was on low battery so I put it on the charger, came back hours later, and could not turn it on. I checked to make sure it was actually connected and plugged in, then I tried plugging in to several different outlets, and finally, tried my other charger from another Lenovo and confirmed that it was simply not turning on. This is the reason I stopped buying Macs, after 3 separate incidents of sudden battery death on 3 separate computers (and completely different models) I swore them off. I am so disappointed as we have at least 6 Lenovos and had never had any problems before. I am truly hoping mine is a dud and that the company will have better policies.I will now try contacting Lenovo and hope for the best. I will update that experience.

  I was skeptical ordering this laptop because of its brand. I have always purchased HP or Dell however the ratings for this was what helped my decision. More features came with this for less money. The overall fit and finish is incredible,surprisingly light and thin. Setup was less than 5 minutes and the picture quality is the best I have seen on comparable laptops in this price bracket. I would buy a Lenovo again and again if this is the quality they provide. I would however spend a tad more to gain the optic drive but using and external drive isn't a deal breaker....

  My old laptop was DDR Drive, so switched to SSD Drive. This Lenovo S340 makes my IPad 6th generation look slow, no kidding! No more spinning wheel while humming the Jeopardy jingle w/my old laptop waiting for a requested site to come up. Boom! It‚Äôs there. Downloads same thing...what took minutes is now seconds, especially Zip files. The surprise feature is the Lenovo Transfer Assistant. I transferred everything from my old computer to my Lenovo S340 seamlessly, just follow the voice commands. Best to start during early evening into overnight as took 9 hr‚Äôs to complete the transfer. It does not transfer your Cloud pics, so you have to do that separately by following ICLOUD instructions. But hey, if I could do all this while in my 70‚Äôs, it should be a snap for you younger folks. Touchscreen is great, did not even bother setting up my Mouse, may do so if my wife finds out out great this laptop is, but for now she is content using her ever so slow HP Notebook. Backlight keyboard is great for evenings, as is the FHD 1920x1080 for watching movies on Amazon Prime or Internet Archive.

  This may be as much about how bad Microsoft is as it is Lenovo.  We will see if Lenovo comes through with a warranty solution.This is a laptop/tab Christmas present for my daughter who is in college.  Immediately after we opened it, we allowed all of the Windows updates to be done and then we went back and did the Lenovo updates which included the Synaptics driver.  Worked great.  Then 12/28 Microsoft pushed one of its forced updates.Everything on the PC worked except the sound.  Neither the speakers nor the earphone jack would work.  Not on mute and up 100%.  We rolled back the Windows update.  Still no success.  We reloaded the newest Lenovo drivers.  No success.  Ran a full hardware diagnostic from Lenovo.  No problems indicated.  Have gone all over forums and found no solution.Basically we have a silent PC and a ticket in with Lenovo.  BTW - not sure what gives, but Lenovo shows warranty is about 1/3rd through, with a purchase date of 8/22.  Given that I didn't purchase this from Amazon until 12/10, there is something REALLY amiss here.  Amazon?  You filled the order; you have some 'splainin' to do.  This was ordered as a new 3rd generation (which is what the box says); not a refurb.Maybe someone has a helpful hint?UPDATE: It really is a defect issue.  Using HDMI I can connect to TV and it will pump out sound no problem. Lenovo has responded and will send a box to send it off for warranty repair.  Still no explanation why they say so much of the warranty is already out when it shouldn't be.  Everyone can get a lemon now and then, but it is how it is handled after the fact that will determine whether this will remain at one star or move up more.ADDITIONAL UPDATE: Lenovo Warranty Service was quick to send a box and fix.  It was a hardware failure.  I still do not know if they have corrected the warranty period yet.  So I can't give it four stars.  Really about 2.5 stars.FINAL UPDATE: Sound card went out again.  Clearly they have a product integrity issue as this had to be replaced before.

  Family loves this laptop--quality keyboard, tough, quick SSD, nice touch screen, good weight. I bought the Lenovo 4X80H34887 Active Capacitive Pen, which works very well with this device and even includes a little clip that allows you to attach the pen to the USB port.I don't understand Lenovo's philosophy behind the tactile quality in their touchpads. The last three Thinkpads I've purchased have had very robust touchpads that were unfortunately very loose. You touch the surface of the touchpad and the surface moves down about a millimeter before it hits the contact for the mouseclick. The movement to the click contact is very deep (relatively speaking) and has very little resistance. This means that in typical usage--gliding around the touchpad, tap-to-click--the surface of the touchpad is constantly bouncing up and down. I guess someone likes that, since they seem to be deliberately designed that way, but, personally...no thanks. I want no play between the first touch and the point at which pressure is applied to the click contact.There was a huge difference in price between this and the same model on the Lenovo website. Not sure if these are seconds or something. I do notice a verrry slight bulge at the at the top, around where the ""0"" or ""-"" keys are, where the case bends up just a little bit. When you eyeball down from the side looking at the function keys, you can see a slight rise at the point. In other words, a slight imperfection. My family doesn't appear to have noticed it, nor have they said anything negative about the touchpad, so I guess I'm being a little too picky. Hard to complain at this price!

  OK, first the good: this little laptop has a fantastic IPS display. It has a very, very comfy keyboard that is easy to type on, even in spite of the laptop's tiny size. The SSD is speedy and much nicer than a hard drive. The battery lasts at least 7 hours on a charge, which is perfectly great for me. Including Windows 10 Pro is a very classing move by Lenovo, and bloatware is minimal to non-existent. Also, the build quality is fantastic. Everything about this machine gives you confidence that it is well put together and unlikely to suffer from troubles like broken corners or screen hinges. Now the bad, which is probably more about me than about the laptop itself. It is poky slow. I know the processor is the latest, quad-core Celeron, and that is fantastic, but it honestly is just not that quick. Even web browsing in Chrome can feel slow depending on how complex the websites you like are (hint, things like nbcnews, PCWorld, and even Amazon are apparently complicated enough to make scrolling through them just a bit tedious on this machine). Gaming is a definite no-no on this machine, although I CAN confirm it works well with Minecraft Windows 10 Edition. I upgraded the RAM to 8 GB, but noticed no differences in performance. The real bottleneck on this machine is most definitely its CPU, which just is not that fast. If you need something ultra portable and don't tend to work on more than one task at a time, and aren't bothered by slightly slow scrolling on websites, this machine is just fine. If you want quicker performance, please spend just a little extra money for something with a quicker processor. I wound up purchasing the Acer ZX53VW, and for me personally, it is a much better fit.

  BLUF:  This is an entry level machine.  It will handle routine tasks gracefully and offers some versatility with the 2-1 design, but know going in that there's very little the user can do to upgrade this computer.  It is not a performance powerhouse in this configuration.So bias noted first: I'm a gamer, developer, and I do video/photo editing.  My tastes for computers therefore run to the right end of the bell curve, in that for my use cases I prefer GPUs, higher-end CPUs, as much RAM as I can stuff into the chassis, SSDs, the whole nine.In playing with this machine for some time I have to first say that this is not a machine that will meet my normal needs.  It's using an 11th gen Core I3, so for routine uses it's not going to lag too much, however the memory is capped at 4GB in this configuration.  RAM is soldered to the motherboard so a later upgrade isn't possible.  In practical terms this means web browsing with more than a few tabs will start to stress the computer.  It's also very limited for games, between the 128GB SSD and the sole use of Intel graphics you'll be hard pressed to do much more than web gaming.  In short, on specs alone this is a computer that is suited for light routine duty (email, word processing, excel, web browsing) but it's not a computer that a user will grow into.This all said, the tablet mode does offer some versatility in the use cases.  Downside there is that there is no stylus included, so that's an extra $40-50 purchase from Lenovo.  It does work acceptably when, again, doing typical stuff...but as a design platform the hardware limits hold it back.I did find the screen rather nice albeit somewhat on the dim side.  It has a glossy coating to it because it's also a touchscreen, so keep that in mind if you plan to use this outside...the glare is going to mitigate things quite a bit.  The ad copy says there are 360 degree hinges (wouldn't they actually be 180 degrees though...) and the laptop can be configured as a tablet, a tent, or traditional with infinite adjustment across the arc.  Again, very nice nod to multi-use capabilities, however I'll mention the hardware limitations in this configuration.It streams video well enough, the sound is fine (although in tent mode the speakers face away from the viewer), and as long as you aren't pushing the limits it is a solid machine.But.You knew that was coming.From my perspective it's clear Lenovo cut quite a few corners to make this price point.  The trackpad is on the small side, something I wasn't expecting in this kind of laptop (it also has no glass surface, so it isn't as smooth as it could be).  Plastic dominates the construction and while it's a decent plastic...it's still plastic.  The machine itself is very light as a result, with what I think is a battery that could use some more capacity if this is a travel machine.  With typical use I got about 6-7 hours out of it, which leads me to another item to discuss....Lenovo has set Windows 10 here in S mode, meaning that it cannot run non-Microsoft stuff.  This has certain advantages when it comes to streamlining things (indeed, it runs very efficiently, no doubt helping battery life and processing speed), but...it doesn't run non-Microsoft Store stuff and it's the first thing I disable when I set up a new computer.  In other words, having this in a typical configuration does run the risk of slowing things down, getting abbreviated battery life, and so on.  And the included charger is a barrel-type connector (while charging via USB-C is possible, you're on your own to get the charging hardware for that).So why do I like it?Because really, as an education computer it works quite well.  It's not something that a kid is going to go nuts with, but it does have enough horsepower to handle video calls, teleconferences (built in camera is good quality) and simply being able to keep up with remote learning.  It's something I don't have many qualms about handing it to my seven year old for her classes.  Having it plugged in while she's working on class, in tent mode for watching videos, etc...it works very well for her.So in a nutshell, this isn't an Uber-powerful machine.  It will falter if there are a lot of things open at once.  But as a general-use machine it offers acceptable performance, and the 2-1 construction with touch capabilities gives it some versatility.  Overall I think it's a good machine for what it is.

  I like the IdeaPad Flex line. Many manufacturers have tried to create a laptop that can double as a tablet, but most of the implementations have failed--either they're unreliable, or they sacrifice usability in the laptop mode (keyboard) for the sake of tablet usability. Ever try to use a Surface laptop with a type cover in your lap?The Flex line, which IBM has made for a few years now, gets the form/function mostly right--although at the cost of a laptop that's significantly heavier and thicker than other implementations (this one is 0.82"" and 3.3 pounds). There are more elegant solutions, but most of those run more than twice what this costs.Anyway, while I find there's much to like about the general implementation, this particular version is a mixed bag.What you get in this particular IdeaPad Flex is a very recent Intel I3 processor (i3-1115G4 (2C / 4T, 3.0 / 4.1GHz, 6MB), Integrated Intel UHD graphics, 128Gb of NVMe storage, and 4Gb of RAM. While the I3 chip isn't the fastest thing on the planet, this modern version is certainly quite capable enough for browsing, productivity apps, photo editing and even most games. Where you'll see it stutter will be apps that soak every cpu cycle out of your laptop and that can take advantage of parallelism. The average person doesn't have those kinds of use cases. But if you are a scientific programmer or do video rendering or something like that, you know this laptop isn't for you.Anyway, the processor is more than fine for your average surf/social media/YouTube/etc. user.128Gb of NVMe storage isn't huge, but it's enough to comfortably hold the Windows 10 OS and leave a bunch left over for the user. Out of the box, first boot, you have 86Gb free. Also, the NVMe storage is upgradable. They don't make it trivial to do the upgrade, but it's not hideously difficult, either. Basically, you need to remove a bunch of screws on the bottom of the laptop, then carefully snap the plastic bottom away from the case. Once you do that, the NVMe storage stick is easily accessible.The laptop also comes with modern 802.11ac WiFi and BlueTooth 5.0. No issues there.Where this laptop fails, though, is with respect to memory. There's only 4Gb of memory included with the laptop--about the bare minimum acceptable for a modern laptop running Windows 10. What stinks is that the memory is soldiered to the motherboard and CANNOT BE UPGRADED. That's fairly inexcusable for a laptop that gives you access to the motherboard. What being limited to 4Gb of memory means is that if you are the kind of person who tends to run multiple applications simultaneously, you'll find them slow to load. If you are the kind of person who tends to have many browser windows open, you'll find that many of them crash or else go to sleep. Apps that tend to be memory hogs, such as Google Hangouts, may drive your laptop to a crawl as the soak up the available memory. And so on.During the setup phase of the laptop (when it was installing updates, etc.) I repeatedly had apps hang as a result of memory deprevation.Beyond the specs already noted, you have two decent (for a laptop) speakers, one at each side of the keyboard. You have a low-res 720p webcam which does a pretty good job of light management, but which takes fairly poor pictures. There are two microphones built into the laptop which I would term adequate, but not amazing. There's a physical shutter integrated into the shell that can hide the camera, for those who worry about that sort of thing. It's a cute added feature (see photo).The keyboard itself is quite comfortable to type on. I have no complaints there.The laptop comes configured with Windows 10 S, which is a dumbed down version of Windows created for those who are satisfied with ONLY installing apps from the Windows store. If you are dealing with a user who you might not trust to install apps from the Web, or where other security worries are an issue, you might want to keep the laptop in Windows 10 S mode. But if you are an advanced user, or if you want to install anything that isn't in the Windows App Store, then you'll need to move to a full Windows 10 Home installation. This is TRIVIALLY accomplished by following a link you can find in the settings-> updates-> activation panel. It takes about 30 seconds to complete. Note that once you move to WIndows 10 Home from Windows 10 S, you can't go back.Battery life is decent. On a full charge, using it for a combination of surfing, watching video, etc., I got just over 9 hours on a full charge. The battery is integrated and is 52.5 Wh. If you wind up needing to replace the battery, you'll have to remove the back of the case. The battery is held in place by a series of screws. As with the NVMe storage, it's not incredibly difficult, but you won't be switching batteries on the fly in the airport lounge.Ports include both a round port for the included charger, a USB-C port that supports charge delivery (so you can charge your laptop through the USB-C port), an HDMI 1.4b video output slot, and 2x USB-A 3.1 gen 1 ports, which support 5Mbps data transfer. One of them is always on, so you can charge devices from it, even if your laptop is off. The charger provided works with the round power port, provides 65W charging, and does not provide any additional charge ports. If you have a modern GaN USB-C charger rated at 65W or more, you can easily keep the charger that comes with this laptop in a drawer and use that instead to charge through the USB-C port.The touchscreen is reasonably bright and reasonably responsive. It works well in the ""tee pee"" mode, as shown in the pics, to watch video. One caveat: The speakers in tee pee mode will be facing the BACK, rather than the viewer.On the whole, I like the form factor here, and on most counts, this is a decent starter machine for anyone who mostly uses their laptop for either content consumption or else for standard productivity apps. I wouldn't recommend it to a gamer, to someone doing any video production, or to anyone used to having a lot of applications running simultaneously. The 4Gb of not-upgradable RAM is a real bummer here and prevents me from rating this a full 5 stars, even for light users. But I think if your use of a laptop is most as a consumer of content (plus maybe using Microsoft Office--not included), then this laptop will probably be OK. If you can find a variant upgraded to 8Gb of memory for not much more, however, I'd seriously consider that.

  I like a Chromebook, especially when the camera works.  I found Lenovo support online and scheduled an appointment for them to call me.  They called the exact time I had scheduled.  The technician was knowledgeable and professional.  I found out there is a small switch at the top of the screen that covers the camera.  I would highly recommend a Lenovo Chromebook.  I have had mine a week and will add additional information if any problems arise.

  After two good days, I barely can write this review its sucks so bad. Baklit keyboard was COMPLETELY FALSE ADVERTISING!! I cant get the touch screen to work. Every so often the screen goes hog wild and decides to computer itself. Worst product on the market, my last ACER Chromebook was 5 years old without one hiccup ever. This sucks balls since it was my birthday computer purchase.

  Seller sending different model / version.  Did NOT have backlit keyboard.  I bought one of these last year and it DID have the backlighting.  Loved it!  Bought another about a month ago and no backlighting.  It sucks when you're in the dark and need to type something and cannot see the keys.  Sent it back assuming it was defective since the listing says backlit keyboard (5th bullet point).  Ordered a replacement and same problem.  Turns out if you check the full model number, the last 3 digits are different from my first to the 3rd and THAT is the difference.  Sent it back as well and found an awesome HP for a better price elsewhere.

  First computer I ever purchased for myself and it was a big mistake. For zoom calls the background cannot be changed which is a big drawback. I can‚Äôt print to my Canon printer from chrome book. Basically it is only good for watching videos (with external speakers) and reading emails. It also drops WiFi connection intermittently where my other devices do not. I do not recommend a chrome book for anyone.

  When you hear the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" it normally has negative connotations, but in this case you get a well built, low budget, everyday PC with some gaming protentional, with just a few trade offs. My daughter asked for a laptop for her birthday, I had an older Alienware laptop I upgraded and gave to her brother to play Minecraft, and she understandably wanted something similar.This shipped super fast during snow and ice storms! Well done Fed Ex!The GoodThe laptop looks nice, feels solid, and is light weight. Upon starting it up I was ready to put an hour or two into cleaning out all the bloatware and loading up the essentials; I was pleasantly surprised to find only 2 programs that needed to be removed(Lenovo something or other, and Mcafee). Boot time is very fast, the wifi is acceptable at this price point, and the gaming performance actually took me off guard. Now its just Minecraft but with a few adjustments in the settings(to optimize) I was getting 90-140 FPS matching the older Alienware laptop which has a 3840qm and a 7970m dedicated graphics card. AMD's APU technology has really come a very long way!The MehhThe screen is lack luster. Although it does give a nice 1920x1080 resolution the color reproductions is not great, its not bad.. but the screen always feels a bit washed out, I did adjust the brightness and a few other settings and cleaned this up quite a bit. The touch pad is... get yourself a mouse.For those of you not Tech Savvy - No drivers were installed at all. Since this is AMD CPU/GPU combo its a very easy fix. You go to AMD's website download Adrenalin and it does all of the work for you, just install and follow the recommended driver installs. This made a HUGE difference in performance.

  So far so good. I was on a hunt for the most laptop I could get for <$500.  I‚Äôm pretty confident this is it. Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt have a touchscreen but the Ryzen 5 3600 processor is decent. It‚Äôs not the latest and greatest but it benchmarks well. I‚Äôm extremely happy with this computer‚Äôs performance. It‚Äôs perfect for working from home. It multitasks well, and the SSD drive makes loading almost instant.My biggest gripe is the display quality. It‚Äôs just fair. Not bad, not good. Honestly, until I set up a second monitor I didn‚Äôt notice. Side by side you can definitely tell the difference. Of course a little more ram and a bigger HD would be nice too but I definitely got what I paid for.I looked at laptops until I was seeing specs in my sleep. Don‚Äôt do this to yourself, just buy this thing. Unless you‚Äôre a serious gamer or you want to do heavy video editing, this thing should work just fine.

  We really liked this laptop until the power button stopped working after just 3 weeks. Amazon did not have one available for replacement so I was directed to contact Lenovo. Their customer service is a nightmare to deal with. At one point I was transferred to a number where I was offered a deal on Roadside Assistance. After 3 unsuccessful calls, I finally had luck chatting with an online rep. It was determined to be a hardware issue and the only resolution offered was to send it in for repair.  After just 3 weeks, this was unacceptable.  I‚Äôm sending this laptop back to Amazon for a refund.

  The screen I received was NOT 15.6, I measured it and it was barely 14 inches and it does make a difference.  if at all possible you need to verify with the seller, amazon, or whomever that what they are sending you is exactly what you ordered. it comes in S Mode whatever the hell that is, and you got to go thru a little crap, to get out of it. But it's doable. Also it wants to force you to use Explorer; but you can bypass that as well. You can call amazon tech support and they will help you. Of course if you're techno savvy, you won't need to. Other than that, I do notice that the keyboard is somehow easier for me to use, don't know why.  This was my second laptop in a week ordered thru amazon. But they do help you if you get a lemon. I still love amazon. I rated it 3 value for money because i received a discount thru amazon and decided to keep it. you be suprised what you can get used to if the cost is right! LoL!!

  week 1:for clarity, this is about the 8gig ram/128gig hard drive version.boots instantly. yes, literally. runs multiple tabs and split screen with ease.  Was told this was ""slightly heavy"" but I feel it's weight is appropriate.  screen bends to tablet formation confidently.OS has -slight- learning curve but it's very similar to an Android phone, (its basically an Android phone) takes about 20 minutes of poking at it to figure out where everything is.Google Docs and Sheets are the new Word and Excel, if you don't know how to find/use them there are tutorials on youtube.  they work exactly the same, it's just where the documents are kept that takes some getting used to.one of the reasons I picked this model is because the ram and hard drive are the sort you find in a ""real"" computer, the last gen of chromebook used cell phone type memory and would reportedly have latency issues, not so with this model.screen and keyboard are back lit comfortably.  keyboard feels great to type on, size is good even as a bigger guy.Battery lasts a VERY long time when browsing and word processing, didn't have to charge for the first two days I used it (estimated 10+ hours feels accurate, though I did not time it.) have not tried gaming or otherwise stressful apps yet.one thing to note is the camera, now hear me out: it's 720p.  it's grainy, and it's ""bad"".  HOWEVER, something that's -good- about that is that in a world where video conferencing is the new normal and many people don't always have computers that can handle receiving HD streaming, they have an easier time receiving zoom calls from me because of the lower rez.  I can be seen and understood, consistently, and that's what I need the machine for.The other plus with the camera is that there is a little slider, so you can cover the camera when not in use.  +1 for privacy.sofar I haven't found anything I really dislike about it.  I wish it came with a Digital Audio Workspace and photoshop like Macs do, but if I had mac money I wouldn't be here lol.  If you need a work computer but don't need audio and visual editors, this is it.  if you have to have those things, you need to drop another 800 bucks and get a mac.  Hope this was helpful ‚úåÔ∏èTwo Months:Still going strong.  Battery life has stayed consistent the 9-10 hour mark.  Bought an HDMI to USB type C adaptor so i can hook it up to a TV, plays shows at 1080p just fine while streaming, no fragging or lag, though i do have to close background programs for that to happen i think that's normal.Minor nitpick: trying to correct typing or cut and paste text when -just using the touchscreen- has some weird hangups that make it difficult.  not impossible, but annoying.  Recommend using a mouse, which you probably already do.  Other than that, the touch screen is really great feature on this machine and something that i will be looking for in any laptop i get from now on. Still highly recommend!3 months: one problem i run into professionally is working with a team of people that use Macs.  Macs have different programs they use to share documents, and groups that ""Live in a Mac Ecosystem"" don't really seem concerned with or motivated to adapt to the newer programs that google uses for document and team management, which i personally feel are superior and have made my life as a student (the second time around) much, much easier.nothing new to report on the lappy, still works great, just saying for prospective buyers: if everyone you work with professionally has a Mac, strongly consider getting a mac.  otherwise, this is still the machine to get.

  My last laptop had a much higher price tag.  I didn't have that kind of cash to replace it when the motherboard had issues.  This one was reasonably priced and will meet my current needs. I couldn't run my Silhouette machine without a laptop so this is the one I chose.  It's taking a bit to get used to but I'm liking it now after 2 days.  First day was a bit frustrating as I am a very low tech person and had to figure out what I had to do to get rid of windows S and be able to use the programs I needed.  Looking back it wasn't that hard but it was stressful! The Lenovo my son bought lasted all through his college years and is now being used by his sister.  My last laptop lasted close to 9 years so looking forward to  a long term relationship with this  new addition to our family.

  This Lenovo laptop exceeded all of my requirements: lighter weight, right-side numeric keypad (which i knew would put me in the bigger 15"" range), touch-screen optional but not required, good screen quality, under $600. I mainly surf the internet, online shop, watch YouTube vids & occassionally create, design & edit resumes. One small annoyance is the touchpad is a bit ""loosey-goosey"" making it hard to find/control the cursor. All in all I'm very satisfied with this laptop.

  El producto me dio problemas rapido con la bateria, de fabrica no me cargaba al 100%, solo alcanzaba el 97%, y la bateria no dura lo que dice el proveedor o en todo caso Lenovo, ya ultimamente la bateria me dura menos de 2 horas, con rendmiento bajo, y el brillo a nivel medio, la vida util de la bateria realmente es malisima, en mi opinion no recomiendo comprar este articulo, ya que incluso soy de El Salvador y hacer esta devolucion se me haria demasiado complicado!

  I have no other complaints other than the battery drains quickly!! Not what I expected from a new laptop! I allow it to drain and charge fully but within say 21/2 hours of use battery saver comes on. so battery saver is on now, power button light flashing and notification says 53 mins remaining (18%) remaining.

  I placed my order for my  lenovo laptop yesterday and it arrived this afternoon. I have been working on this computer since then for about 5 hours to browse the webpages and to do work with MS Office applications, and to read from Kindle, etc. I cannot highly recommend it for the very fast speed to start and work with any programs. Much much faster than my Macbook Air! Besides, the windows system is a bit more open than Apple OS. I really don't like the hegemony Apple OS holds over my music, photos, and office files. I could not even update my office on Apple OS. It is really a good computer that deserves enthusiastic recommendation and popularity.

  Update: Finally had to return this piece of crap üí©WARNING!! Look at this review before you buy!!!Notice well that apart from me, none of the other buyers have the ‚Äúverified purchase‚Äù tag. Those idiots are trying to get their review up by using underhanded means. Be warned !The laptop by itself is sleek looking and is quite light.The screen is not that bright but is cool to the eyes.The laptop is a bit slow but since I bought it for entertainment purposes, it‚Äôs okay for me.The battery is underperforming because it barely crosses the 2.5 hour mark during video playback.The graphics performance is below average. But that even is still okay.But the absolute worst, THE WORST, is the fact that the hardisk drive is perhaps defective as it freezes very frequently during video playback.Also, when the volume is increased there is a vibrating sound that comes from the chassis. And once the volume is up, the hardisk drive crashes more frequently.This is not what I expected from Lenovo.This is just plain sad.A piece of advice for them would be that they please hire some good engineers to develop their product.RIP LenovoAn utter disaster of a product.

  Battery:After nearly a week of usage, I have to say this laptop lasts me pretty much 5-6 hours before I start charging when it still has about 30% battery left. I use it in between classes and school work (basically light load) and it runs smoothly with no lag what so ever (thank you i5-cpu).Screen Color and Brightness:The max screen resolution is 1366 x 768, and the color is a bit off from full HD color, which kind of disappoints me. There is a variation out there that have a better FHD screen with 1920 x 1080 but not sure how to find it. However the screen looks nice if you use darker themes, and wallpapers, bright colors are wonky so generally I put it at 50% brightness and it looks best that way.Weight:This laptop surprised me with how much it weighs, it might have something to do with how well the plastic material is, because certainly it isn't because of the battery size. However this gives me a feeling of sturdy durability.Gaming:Okay, I haven't tried the hardcore GPU demanding games on this laptop yet and I will not because I know it can't handle it. However, normal indie games like ""Cross Code"", or if you're a fan of Old school JRPG games like ""Trails in the Sky"" which both are on steam, it will run flawlessly.Well you know... the type that are described as ""Game-able On-The-Go"", and I just pop the game open in between classes if I have no other schoolwork I have to do.Sound:Nothing much to say, sound just sucks 4/10, it works fine, but when it's above 50% volume, you'll start to hear buzzing noises from the speakers. Just bring your own 3-mm jack earbuds/headset. Heck even Bluetooth earbuds work too (I use a pair of Jabra Elite 65t), since the laptop have Bluetooth built-inOverall Aesthetics:The midnight blue color is just so stunning, kind of a personal preference but the lowkey branding logo off the side, and modest clean look of the overall color and design, just fascinating and soothing to look at.Score: 7/10

  Well, I'm writting this after seeing a lot of people saying this laptop is the worst, I don't know if their laptops came with fabric problems, because I didn't have any problem since I bought It; I'm using it since march 2019, it's actually worth it with the price (420$) I didn't found any NEW LAPTOP with i5 8th Gen. under this price, I remark NEW because people compare it with used prices. Here's my review:The Optane technology makes the computer very fast, turns on in less than 1 minute, I use it for university and music production, updated it with a 8gb ram, now I have 12gb, didn't upgrade the disk, but I'm sure if I do it the computer it's going faster; the screen is normal, isn't bad and isn't the best. I have nothing bad to say about it, I know it isn't 1080p Full HD but it's ok, no problem and you can see 1080p content without problems; the brightness is ok, I love that is anti-glare, it helps a lot and you have options in the Lenovo app that can help you in the night with the color calibration, for me, eye care it's always on and at the max, I like how it looks; the sound is low if your environment is loud, for me in my house it's ok to see videos, some music, some sounds, usually I use the laptop with 50% of volume and I'm done. Speakers doesn't have bass but I like them because are clear, you don't have any distortion at the max volume. The audio out it's ok, and I use an usb audio interface so I got very nice sound. I'm thankful with the USB-C port because I didn't know about the USB-C technology and it's really fast, works great. The keyboard is soft and smooth, also thankful with the num pad, it's very useful. Missing the backlight in it. But nothing to cry. The Intel i5 8th Gen processor, works so fine, fast, open programs really fast; ram can annoy sometimes but if you upgrade it like me, you'll never have a performance problem. And I upgraded it because of my music production work, I don't know if it's necessary if you use it for the normal use. I used the 4GB ram for about 5 months and didn't have problems. Thankful with the 1TB HDD and the original Windows license, I'm not having plans to upgrade to an SSD (yet). The battery it's ok too, about 3 hours. You have options to give more life to your battery in the Lenovo app. I know there are laptops with 8 hours. For me it's enough, but it were cool if this laptop had a bit more.  The charger is so small, only the adapter and cable, really surprised, I was accustomed to the big and heavy square that all the laptops had, it's like the Mac's charger. Finally, the weight and the thickness of the laptop. You can lift it with one hand and put it wherever. Totally worth It with the price. A laptop with this specs or worst in my country costs at least 900$ not joking (Ecuador). The materials are resistant and feels nice. I'm very happy with my purchase.

  Cheap laptop for some light gaming; considering there isn't a dedicated graphics card, the size could probably be cut down on, because the screen size is a little ridiculous. The shift key, as many others complained, is also short--I don't understand the decision behind that.I think that if you'll be writing a lot, like college essays and whatnot, then this definitely isn't for you. It can handle some light gaming--older titles, mostly. The color quality is also surprisingly good for how cheaply the rest of it seems to have been built.

  My old laptop that I was replacing is a Lenovo.  I use a Lenovo laptop at work.  I have been happy with both of those, so I decided to go with another Lenovo. I am sorry I purchased it & am very unhappy with my purchase.  What in the work is up with the right-handed shift key??!!!  It's in a different place than every other computer key board shift key I've ever used.  Due to this, I constantly have errors when typing, am having to stop & correct them.I am SO displeased with this laptop.  What in the world were you thinking, Lenovo???

  On paper it looks really good, the hardware, Core i5, 8Gb, 1Tb drive. In reality it is really cheaply built. The display is just OK, heavy enough to keep wanting to tip the machine over, the keyboard has a known problem in the design, the right shift key was cut in-half and placed next to the up-arrow key so 75% of the time while you're typing you hit the up arrow. Lenovo admits this and suggests using Key Tweaker which is a small app to remap the up-arrow key to an extra right-shift key, that definitely helps alleviate the problem. The overall construction is just cheap plastic, the mother board and components seem well laid out though and the thing is fast. I replaced the 1Tb 5400RPM drive with a 240Gb SSD and this thing really flies! It is noice to have that large screen and truth be told it is also nice that it doesn't seem to weigh much. I have an ASUS ROG gaming 17-inch laptop and you NEVER use it in your lap because it's just too heavy. This feels rather light by comparison but again if you tilt it just a little the weight of the screen will try to tip the machine over. Oh, one other thing, they really scrimped on the speaker, yes I said speaker as in one, MONO, it's bad. I have a Toshiba Radius laptop that has Harmon-Kardon speakers and that thing is sweet, this is just good enough for the beeps and bops that Windows puts out and that's about it..forget it for movies or videos. Is it worth $400? It depends the Core i5 is pricey and it does also use DDR4 2100 memory so it's got the guts to tackle a lot, it's just the fit and finish were lowered in order to keep the price down. I'd rather have a Toshiba 17-inch but that's about $200 more than I paid for this thing.

  I bought 2 of these one for my self and another for a family member.Like others have said the shift key placement is rather anoying but I had no issue getting used to it.Other than that its a decient laptop. I personally like large screens (I use dual 27s on my desktop pc) and this screen was deffenitly a plus. It can play some good older games. But dont expect to play anything new.It does well when playing DVD's and watching Hulu/Netflix. Although dont expect to edit gopro footage. It will handle Blender pretty well as well as Lightroom and Photoshop.Overall I'm pleased with it. I'd recomend it but dont expect a workhorse.

  The right hand shift key causes typing errors, because it is not located in the same location as other laptops. There is something wrong with the power system. The message ""locking"" comes up and then the computer shuts down. Batteries seem not to last in the computer and taking them out requires an engineer. No simple battery compartment. The engineer who decided to redesign the location of the shift key and the non-existent battery compartment is an idiot and should be fired.

  Loads Windows 10 (s-mode) quickly , about 25 seconds. Set screen brightness at 75% and tilt slightly back a little further than normal to correct washed out appearance. Battery life is running at about 7 hrs. with intermittent use. I did shut down all unnecessary apps from running in the background in the settings. I'm not a fan of Windows 10 s-mode which limits the user to apps from the Microsoft Store. You can switch to win. 10 home for free which does not require this limitation, however I have a 250 gb ssd in my unit so I have not switched and I'm trying to work with  the S-mode, I may switch sometime in the future. I do recommend this laptop for general use around the home, my only complaint is that the graphics could be better., Ok I used this laptop for about 2 more weeks and I would add that I have switched it out of the Windows 10 s-mode without any problems. There was no significant issue or change to the amount of used space on the 250 gb hard drive and it is operating normally in the Win 10 standard (home) mode which is a free switch so it will now accept apps from outside the windows store.

  My old 2012 ThinkPad, that I used for a few things to keep those things off my newer computer, finally died. I selected this Ideapad as a reasonable option for those uses.As most people know, ThinkPads have the best keyboard in the business. This machine can't meet that standard, but it is pretty good for a laptop. I'm a fast touch typists and I got along with it.The screen looks good but is only 1366x768 which isn't very inspiring for a 15 inch screen. This machine is not meant for gaming or high class photo and video editing!One very nice feature that many computer makers don't provide: The top row of keys has shifted options for various features of the computer. This machine, like most competitors comes set so the those extra options are not shifted. You have to press Fn+F key to get a function key to work. Not very good for people who know Windows short cut keys or who have software that regularly uses function keys. Fortunately this machine has an option in the BIOS to restore the keys to the proper function. I almost never use those extra key features but routinely use the actual function keys, so this makes the computer much more pleasant to use.In comparison to the old ThinkPad which I had downgraded to 4gig of ram and an old 360 gig HD, this machine is blazing fast with 12 gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD. It is also very slim and light so it is much easier to carry. However I was surprised it didn't charge via USB and the power brick has fixed prongs, not folding prongs. That is a minor complaint but still surprising. I haven't used it long enough to test the battery life.Big warning: This machine comes with Windows 10S which I thought I heard had been withdrawn by MS? If you don't want to be limited to using only apps from the Windows Store, be sure to Google how to switch from 10S back to Windows Home. I would have returned this machine if I couldn't switch back to real Windows 10.Also, if you prefer using local accounts on the machine, rather than a Microsoft Account, be sure to ignore the option to link to WiFi during the setup. Only if it doesn't have a network connection will it allow you to set up a local account. You can always connect to WiFi after finishing the setup.

  After spending a couple hours on initial setup, I attempted to install my primary software, and discovered that this machine came with Windows in S mode. Say what?  I had specifically bought this particular model over some other choices because it did NOT say it was coming with Windows S mode. So I figured, ok, no big deal. Switching out of S mode is supposed to be fairly simple. I follow the instructions on Microsoft's site, and it directs me to the Windows Store to get the ""Switch out of S mode"" app. Weird, but okay...So I try to ""get"" the app, and instead all I see is a vague error saying ""something happened and we couldn't start the upgrade"". Lovely.I tried for the next few hours everything I could find online to fix it, but with no progress.I called Lenovo, who basically told me to pound sand, unless I wanted to pay them for ""premium software support"". Oh no, I'm not paying you to get my brand new laptop working!I finally got on the phone with Microsoft directly, and spoke with a nice lady who was able to remote into the machine (using Quick Assist), and verify the error.After trying everything she knew (including setting up a new user account with a Microsoft account auto-login), she finally gave up and we performed a clean install of Windows 10 Home, using a custom config file she helped me inject into the iso file I downloaded from MS servers.So now my machine is finally up and running regular Windows 10 Home, version 20H2, without all the Lenovo bloatware.All-in-all, this was a truly painful process, and a complete waste of time. This machine never should have come with the pointless S mode enabled to begin with. I blame Lenovo for that, since I have 2 other Lenovo laptops (an S340 and another Ideapad 3), both bought within the past 6 months, and neither of them came in S mode.

  Negative- The battery lasts an only an hour even when in battery saving mode.  I'm constantly having to plug in.  Camera quality is very poor, looks extremely grainy and dark in virtual meetings.  Graphics are not great. Poor ventilation.Positive- touchscreen works properly, plenty of memory, good processor; moves pretty fast.  Overall, for the price I paid I am satisfied. I was not concerned about graphics when I purchase but disappointed mainly in the battery life.

  Unless this is resolved, I do not recommend getting a Lenovo machine. When I opened the computer, I registered the product. The 1 year warranty showed that it started over 5 months ago. I purchased this computer a few days ago. They don't base the warranty on purchase date to end user. It's based on the purchase date to the vendor. So this computer sat for almost 6 months and the warranty started with the vendor. This is just not right and it's not how you do business.EDIT: I adjusted my rating. Lenovo support granted my request and extended the warranty. That's great but I don't feel like I should have to make that request. I understand a vendor purchased this from Lenovo, then I purchased from the vendor, but they should have a system in place that handles this for the end user.My first impression is the keyboard area of the laptop is too far back from the front of the device. The keys are all the way back and lean toward the left. The numeric keypad should not have been included on the right side. It throws off the balance while typing. I chose the Windows 10 installation and I've already had issues with Windows, so that's not necessarily the manufacturer's fault.For now I'm going with an average rating. I might improve the rating as time passes.

  I purchased this 2in1 because of its great features for a person on the go. The LTE, battery life, and 2in1 features were great.Unfortunately, the features in the listing is where my like if the machine ended. I powered it up and let it run and update over night. I then went to unlock it to WIN 10 PRO, and restart it. Thats where it ended. It then would just attempt to boot. It would never pass the Lenovo screen and after a few hard resets, it attempted to repair. The repair process would never finish and would never fully boot up.I requested a replacement. It made it to me in two days. I am now using it. It still has some limitations due to Windows on ARM64. Also the process for activating the LTE is an endless loop. Never allowing you to activate. I will be calling Lenovo once the open. To try and fix the LTE activation, not expecting much from them.Hopefully Windows on ARM64 gets more support to help with the compatibility issues.

  With the new windows update, this computer was excellent.  The battery life was incredible, almost 14 hours running windows pro.  The touchscreen was accurate, and the pen was super accurate with no lag.  The LTE connection was solid, in my area I was consistently getting 120 mbps on verizon.  With the newest update to windows, chrome worked flawlessly, as did firefox.My only complaint was I could not get office to activate.  Despite having an office 365 subscription, it kept telling me that my ""trial has expired.""  I think that could be because I downloaded and installed the version from the web instead of using the built in office (which I uninstalled).I would absolutely recommend this laptop, mine just had that weird error that I couldn't get fixed.

  After 2 months of light use (occassionally and strictly at home), the plastic connecting the tablet and the keyboard starts to come out (see picture). And I have been extremely careful around it at home, so I believe it might be a design issue. I ordered a new (not refurbished) 2-in-1 laptop, and it does not come with warranty. I looked up the warranty terms and conditions online and it appears that the warranty period was from 2018-2019, and it doesn't seem like there is an option for even purchasing a warranty (and if it does, not sure whether or not it will cover these kind of 'issues'). So basically I am not sure who can I turn to if my laptop acts up at some point in the future. Definitely something to consider if you are thinking of buying a laptop.In terms of the actual hardware, since I have limited apps, so far it's working well. Once I got it, I charged it for a little bit and turned it on and it's good to go. Surfing the internet and all that is smooth and mostly depends on your own wifi network and other factors. So far I haven't seen any issues with performance. However, it does drain battery life quickly. Let's just say I won't feel comfortable taking it out to a coffee shop without a charger, and it's safer to always take the charger with you since battery life is not great.However, I like the fact that it's a 2-in-1 so I can easily use it in tablet mode and detach the keyboard. Also it's pretty thin but it lacks ports (which means you will need some external hubs for USB, etc) - hence the 4 stars.The keyboard itself is plastic-made and you can feel it while you type. Not super sturdy and looks cheaply made. There tends to be a lag as you type but sometimes all it takes is just to take out the tablet and reattach it again to the keyboard.

  I bought this for simple note taking and light word processing. I knew BEFORE buying that windows 10s could only use apps from the Microsoft app store, however I planned on upgrading to windows 10 pro immediately. The Microsoft app store was corrupted upon the initial setup (right out of the box) alright a known issue with windows 10, however this also made it impossible to fix as the only way to fix this is to get out of 10s, which can only be done by downloading through app store! You can't even open a cmd prompt to force it threw. After 5 hours of trouble shooting with no eesolve, it's headed back. I have loved Lenovo for years and have owned/ own many if their products, but this now unsteadys my faith in anything they make, and is no wonder why they are no longer making this product.

  The Miix 630 is excellent, but there is no product support available. I have a broken screen, and it is impossible to find a replacement, so it is essentially useless. The screen will inevitably crack and it is not unreasonable to expect there to be replacement parts available. So 1 star.

  I started looking at these last year, but didn't want to spend $800. At $444, it's a great deal. Popped in a Sprint Sim Card and I was online in seconds.

  Right out of the box I'm so pleased. I purchased a ""used, like new"" model. Luckily, the previous owner had already changed it from Windows S mode to Windows pro. This saved me a lot of time and trouble. Installing non-MS software such as Chrome has been no trouble.Update after a month's use and taking on international trips: It performs beautifully, the sim card is so easy to add and remove for a new country. I don't understand why they discontinued this model. Only wish it had more RAM options. I'm a little afraid to install resource-hogging apps.

I checked the specs and it is exactly what the seller claimed to be. This laptop is sleek and very light, love it!  It is a fast start, had been binge watching movies and videos, put the laptop on sleep mode and so far no overheating problem. One thing though, the screen resolution is not as sharp as I expected it to be. For the price, this is an excellent computer, just had this for only 3 days.

  After passing off last year's model to my brother (3500U Flex 14), I got this as soon as I saw it posted up on Reddit. I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since.Let's get the rundown here.- Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU- Radeon Vega 6 graphics- 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop)- 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD- 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!)Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but it opens up almost all the way with one hand (tilts towards the end). The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more ""premium."" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2.I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W).The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a ""worst case"" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all!Camera is acceptable. Nothing to write home about, but it'll work well enough for video calls. Battery is excellent - while browsing the web and watching videos, I have been consistently draining 10% per hour of use! That 10 hour claim from Lenovo seems pretty spot on.Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier:- 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7- Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (4700U option is now available in some places)- Metal constructionI'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing.

  ***UPDATE 3 - 12/2/20 - Have had several issues recently and wanted to pass along how I resolved them.  Issue #1 was trying to boot up the computer after 12 hours of sleep and being unable to get the computer to turn on at all.  Didn't matter if it was plugged in or not.  The battery was fully charged.  I tried holding the power button.  No go, laptop was dead.  As a final attempt before sending it in for service, I pulled off the bottom cover of the laptop and disconnected the battery cable for several minutes.  I plugged it back in, pressed the power button,and the laptop booted normally.  Everything worked fine after that and I haven't had the issue since.  Issue #2 was noticing the laptop was no longer charging when connected to the USB-C charger.  Even the charging LED wouldn't come on.  The fix was to shut down the computer completely, then hold the power button for 20-40 seconds.  The charge light came on and the laptop started charging again.**UPDATE 2 - 7/2/20 - Resolved an audio stuttering issue by turning off Dolby Audio processing in the Dolby app.***UPDATE - 6/10/20 - Dropping a star.  Sent original back due to crashing issues when waking from sleep.  Wifi also dropped occasionally and had trouble reconnecting after sleep.  New unit seems to work fine.  Also replaced wireless card with Intel AX200 (need torx T5 bit to remove bottom panel).  Much faster and no dropped connections.  Still really like the laptop (and Amazon's return policy).*Original Review:Overall usability ‚Äì Everything about the laptop feels well-built and like it should cost hundreds more.  Incredibly fast processor, especially given the 15W TDP.  The AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors (7nm Zen 2) have really improved the thermals and efficiency to the same level as Intel (or better).  Between the 6 core processor and the  PCIe NVMe SSD the laptop flies.  Nothing I‚Äôve thrown at it has been able to slow it down or make it stutter.  Benchmarks comparable to my HP desktop with i7-7700 (if in best performance mode while plugged in).  Applications open instantly in most cases.  Comes out of short-term sleep instantly.  Nice webcam privacy cover.  Fingerprint reader is best I‚Äôve used in terms of accuracy and speed.  Fans are quiet under normal loads and a low non-annoying whirring when the GPU/CPU is taxed.Exterior ‚Äì Very light weight (but not cheap feeling) and nice sturdy build.  Feels like it will hold up well.  Keyboard back-light adjustable.  Plenty of ports.  Hinges also feel built to last.Touchscreen ‚Äì Sensitive and good feel (though I prefer matte to glossy).  Works well with included pen.Bloatware ‚Äì Almost none (uninstalled Skype).Speakers ‚Äì Above average for price range.  Not especially tinny sounding like cheaper laptops.  Don‚Äôt expect bass though.  The included Dolby equalizer software can help improve the sound if you don‚Äôt mind experimenting.  Side-mounted front-facing speakers are well placed.Screen ‚Äì Brightness OK for indoor use, but I plan to run it at 90% brightness even on battery because anything less is too dim.  Colors are bright.  No noticeable back light bleed.Battery life ‚Äì Above average for price range.  Really quite impressive.  Could easily last half to three-quarters of the stated 10 hours depending on the conditions (clearly not doing anything processor or graphics intensive for the duration, but web browsing, office work, or video viewing).Wireless/Bluetooth ‚Äì Some occasional random disconnects and trouble connecting after sleep, likely due to Realtek wireless card.  Average speeds on my 5GHz home network.Keyboard/Trackpad ‚Äì High quality feel.  You can tell when you‚Äôve hit a key unlike cheaper laptops.  Miss the numpad, but knew it didn‚Äôt have one before I ordered.  Trackpad not over-sensitive or unresponsive.  Good balance, but still prefer a mouse.Graphics/Gaming ‚Äì Played Two-Point Hospital on Steam at 1080p very high graphics setting.  Not very graphics intensive or an FPS, but the game is newer and frame-rate didn‚Äôt drop below 30 in game.  Game load times are ridiculously fast.Downsides ‚Äì Mediocre webcam.  Soldered RAM (not a big deal w/16 GB, but if it goes bad it is a big problem).  Screen may not be bright enough for outdoor use and the glossy coating leads to reflections/glare when viewing from an angle.  Wireless card not great.  Stories of poor tech support (though, admittedly I‚Äôve never interacted with them).**Don‚Äôt forget to create your USB backup drive from the Lenovo website for crashes/re-installs.  Or have the Windows 10 ISO handy on a USB drive and download the drivers/apps from the website.

  ¬†For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the ""Lenovo Representative"" knows nothing about their product. Yes, it has dual channel 16GB RAM @ 3200mhz, it ships with the Lenovo pencil included. Screen is only @ 250 nits, but I wouldn't call it a deal breaker unless you plan to use it outdoors a lot. Plastic machine but nothing feels cheap. The hinge is a little loose to my taste, the touchpad is a little shaky. Other than those, everything fits my needs. Very satisfying first day of use.Update: the audio starts to cutoff randomly from the 2nd day, all drivers and windows updates and BIOS are up to date. I contacted both Amazon and Lenovo tech support, after a remote session, the problem persists. Then I noticed the trackpad is shaky and sticky ( see video).So overall it's a nice product, but quality control can be a problem.

  We bought this to primarily use for Zoom meetings. The microphone cuts in and out. We tried settings, etc. etc. and have now purchased an auxiliary microphone. Hopefully it works!Otherwise, this computer does what we wanted it to do.

  Love the color, the weight, screen clarity and performance. Set-up was a breeze!! I do a lot of web based programs that do not require much saved space, nor do I store large files(pics, etc), so it works quick and efficiently. I do run multiple programs simultaneously and there is no delay in toggling between them.

  This was better than I had expected.  It boots very quickly, I don't miss my Chromebook's quick booting speed Windows 10 works much better than on my older laptop.  The screen is colorful and sharp enough. It is not as bright as some, according to the review in Laptop magazine which persuaded me to buy it. but bright enough for anything except bright sunlight.  If you want to work outside in bright sun, get one of the others.  It is fine for a shaded porch or anywhere indoors.  The keys can be hard to read in certain  conditions, whether you turn the lighting on or off.  The black keys with white letters on my Chromebook are much better for anyone who looks at the keys a lot while typing.  Touch typing on this one is good.  I do a lot of Zoom meetings and with both of my other computers it kept saying ""your internet connection is unstable"".  But with this computer, I never have a problem despite poor DSL internet.  The speakers can be turned up quite loud which is important to me as my hearing is poor.  If you turn them up too loud on a Zoom call you may get feedback when you talk, but you can always turn them down.  I thought the fingerprint reader was a gimmick, but it is very convenient. It seems very solidly made and doesn't feel heavy even after being used to a 2 pound Chromebook. The WIFI and Bluetooth both have been flawless.  I don't use very demanding software except for Zoom which apparently was more demanding that I thought.  The trackpad and touch screen both work very well.

  Lenovo Support and Premium Care Worst in Industry - DO Note Care about CustomersI bought a Lenovo Yoga C740 14"" - Mica laptop on July 20, 2020 on about Sept 1st, 2020 the screen cracked and the touchscreen no longer worked. The shutter for camera cracked when we tried to close the shutter and it cracked the screen making 3 full length cracks in the screen.I called support via chat and explained the issue they said they would give me  a replacement and they would call in 2-3 days. I week later I called back, escalated the issue and they said for sure in 2 days they would call. 3 days later called back, escalated the issue a 2nd time. Again assurance someone would call.Waited more than a week and called again! this time asking for a full refund. They said they understood and someone would call me.Waited another week, more than 1 month as passed now with cracked screen. I called support on the phone spent 45 mins on the line being transfered and put on hold to finally get hung up on.I called premium support and again they said they will escalate and someone will call. I asked for supervisor or manager. Waited 10 mins only to tell me they are busy! They would call me. I asked for an exact time and they did not want to give it. Finally had no choice but to wait again.Laptop was bought for my son to do his school work now with a cracked screen which can cut him. I cannot get a refund, replacement or anything. Cannot buy a new one until I get a refund as I cannot afford to buy 2 laptops!!!We are screwed and no one at lenovo wants to help, cares to help or i suspect is even able to help. This is by far the worse support and premium care I have ever experience in my lifetime. They build bad laptops then make it impossible to get it fixed, replaced or get a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I bought my Lenovo Yoga C740 at BestBuy (the exact same color and specs that Amazon sells here and the exact same price) and have been using it for about two weeks. I will start with a possible warning, which may or may not turn out to be an issue - the laptop might be dropping randomly wifi connections. Mine did it a few times. Reconnecting is easy but no other laptop or any other smart device at home does it, so it might be a specific issue related to this laptop line. The Lenovo Yoga 730 and C940 lines appear to be having similar wifi issues and there are threads on the Lenovo forums about this problem, offering a number of possible solutions.Otherwise, the machine is very competent - light (about 3 lbs., 1.4 kg.), thin, comfortable, quick. Typing is easy, and the keys are very comfortable, the backlit keyboard has two settings, and the fingerprint sensor is accurate and fast. The battery is outstanding. It seems to last about 8-9 hours on full brightness and probably 14-15 hours on half (I read online reviews where it indeed lasted for 15 hours). The processor is good, although there are better 10th generation Intel i5 models out there, but the laptop is comfortably quick. The screen is bright, the colors are accurate and feel slightly warm. The webcam is fine (720p HD) and has a privacy shutter (a nice decision - it is built-in and requires you to slide it with your nails or with something very thin - the tiny sliding panel is located right above the webcam). The audio is quite loud, coming from a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers. The fan is quiet. It's a 2-in-1 type (Lenovo calls, in fact, a 4-in-1 ), and tablet mode also works well.The ports of the C740 are a bit unusual. It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A 3.1 port. You can charge it in any of the two USB-C ports (the charging adapter has a USB-C jack). It lacks an HDMI port. I bought a small hub from Amazon (QGeeM USB C Hub) that works well with it and has an HDMI port plus some more USB-A ports. I can also confirm that the laptop works well with a Wacom Bamboo Ink pen. It also works with a Lenovo Active Pen 1 or 2 (according to Lenovo). I only tested it with the Bamboo Ink stylus and have had no issues.One final word of caution: beware McAfee LiveSafe that might come pre-installed (the BestBuy model did). Years ago, I used to test AV software as a hobby. McAfee was always a pain to remove and would brick machines worse than other AV programs. This has not really changed over the years. On the day I bought this laptop, I almost returned it back to BestBuy, because after setting Windows 10 for the first time, McAfee got stuck with a bad update and I had to reset Windows because it became unresponsive and would load but then freeze. It was quite a fight to get it to start the resetting process because it would begin to do so and freeze again. After Windows was reset and McAfee removed, there have been no issues.To sum up, it's a nice, pretty stylish laptop. I would think that it is a bit overpriced (cheaper laptops from HP and Dell come with stronger Intel 10th generation i5 processors), but if you pair it against a MacBook (and it looks as nice or even nicer than a MacBook) - then the price would seems good.Update: ONE YEAR LATER. I need to remove one star from my original rating. The Yoga C740 has certain issues with its cooling fan (could get very loud and even would begin to screech and ""thud"", as if the entire cooling unit were out of its socket). The solution was to change the cooling settings in the BIOS and to restore in the Windows 10 registry a ""Processor Power Management"" tab. Lenovo's customer service is incredibly unwilling to offer any assistance and it's only on the Lenovo forums where some help can be obtained from other users. Also - beware BIOS updates! One of them caused the battery not to charge properly and I had to roll back the BIOS, even though Lenovo Customer Service again refused to help (another user did). The laptop still woks fine and looks great, but is prone to problems with the fan, and the BIOS upgrades have been troublesome, to say the least. It also drops every now and then the wi-fi signal (was doing it from the very beginning).

  I work from home and have a heavier Lenovo Thinkpad from work. This one is a lot more portable - around the house and when traveling. It's very responsive and quick. I use a blue marble ""skin"" on it to protect it from scratches. I am a 66 yr old educator who creates online graduate courses for a college in Chicago. I work remotely from Florida and have no problem doing my work on this Yoga. In fact, I've hardly used my work laptop since getting this one 2 mos ago. Favorite features: thin profile, screen brightness, backlit keyboard, and finger recognition for login (which works amazingly well). I've never regretted getting this laptop and highly recommend it.Comment added after 3 mos: This laptop is still working well. My only point of concern after 3 mos. was that I had set the laptop to ""never go to sleep"" if it was plugged in. One morning, when I started to use it, I noticed it was extremely hot and the fan was loudly working. This scared me; I thought the laptop was going to fail. However, I rebooted, and, most importantly, changed the sleep settings, and it has settled down into its ""cool self."" So caveat to all: DO NOT set this laptop to NEVER go to sleep. It will overheat. With the finger-recognition security, it is easy enough to wake up, so there's really no need to never let it sleep. We all get cranky without sleep! (BTW, I found out through this odyssey that Amazon gives you a 1-yr warranty. I would not buy the product warranty that is offered when you first buy the laptop; when I contacted them, they were more than useless. But, AMZN was very helpful and willing to take the fall in the first year if the laptop failed.)

  Looking for a laptop for myself, a freshmen in college, I was so scared that I would purchase the wrong laptop. I looked and compared things for weeks on end. This was the best laptop that I could have ever bought for myself. It runs great, I find no problems in it being slow. The Touch screen works great. I love that I can fold it in have and use it as a tablet if I want. Sometimes when I'm laying in bed to watch a movie I can flip the screen backwards to stand it up. The sound is also amazing on this thing! I am able to have a lot of tabs open at once for school and I have had absolutely no troubles with anything so far. The camera quality is also fantastic for those of you stuck in zoom classes. The battery also last me through at least one, if not two full days of usage. It's really nice that the charger for the computer is a US-C cable, it works perfectly with my pixel phone! If i ever need to charge anything I just switch back and forth between my computer and my phone.Although quick thing, if there are any gamers stumbling on this computer. Although, it is a very amazing computer but I seriously doubt you can run anything heavy duty on here such as a Call of Duty game, CSGO, or anything that needs a lot of ram. If you love playing minecraft though, I was able to run that very easily without no problem.Overall it is a great computer, if anything ever happens to this one I will for sure buy from this company again. Also extra brownie points for this company because it came in A WEEK EARLIER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TOO!! I was shocked to find it in the mail. Any college student looking for a nice computer for school, don't worry no more because this is your best option!

  The computer I received is a nice enough computer, but it is not the one that I ordered from the company. I made that comment to them when the computer initially came. I followed this with two more emails to their customer service asking for them to make it right. The computer I received has only 250 gig memory and the one I ordered had 1 T memory. As I had already started using the computer, I asked simply that they refund to me the difference in cost. It supposedly also came with a 500 gig external hard drive, but there was no external hard drive in the box. I like the computer, but the company is untrustworthy.

  I was looking for a laptop to replace my 15 year old laptop (antique!).  I have had this laptop for 10 days now and have been very pleased.  My primary use is for home:  internet shopping, bill paying, etc.  Setup was simple... guide through each step.  I have downloaded ZOOM to conference with my kids and no gliches.  I would definitely recommend this laptop.  My only caution would be if it is going to be used by children who tend not to be careful, the cover is plastic..... very attractive and I personally love it.... but I can see where it could get broken if handled with carelessness.

  This computer is amazing for the price! I use it for email, writing, the internet, certain programs for taxes and accounting, also for my Cameo Cutting Machine, the Silhouette, and it can handle all of that. I do not use it for gaming so I don‚Äôt know how well it would perform doing that type of stuff. Also it doesn‚Äôt have that much storage, but the set up is amazing. It is beautiful aesthetically and the keyboard is fun to use as it functions very well. My last computer was the HP Spectra which was 1309 dollars and was stolen from me so I had to get something I could afford to replace it and I‚Äôm glad I picked this one!

  I've only had this laptop for three days, but it came as described. I plugged it in, and the whole thing booted up smoothly.  It runs all my basic software and a couple of games. This might have gone over my head, but I was surprised with the touchscreen feature so that's a plus! So far, I'm in love with this laptop.

  Looks like new but this is worst than 10yr old laptop. Can handle even little load. if I open 3-4tabs in the chrome, it takes forever to load. This is just the worst laptop on amazon.

  I think this e495 laptop with Ryzen 5 processor is a great laptop for the money (I paid around $500). It runs quite quickly and with the full high-def (FHD) screen, characters and details are very sharp. I ran it on the battery for over 8 hours with fairly heavy usage.  I also like the large, responsive and sensitive touchpad which makes it easy to position the pointer.  Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.

  This is my first new laptop in over twenty years. I've been getting by with work desktops, iPad/keyboard combos and reconditioned macbooks.  After slogging through the first 10 months of the pandemic remote working with an iPad Air & keyboard, I finally gave up and bought this Thinkpad. And, so far, I am very happy with it.  The battery life seems pretty good, the keyboard is excellent, the processor is plenty fast for business use including remoting into my office with VMWare and the screen is very easy to read.  I paid about $500 for this machine. It has what feels like the same solid feel that I remember from old Thinkpads in the IBM days and still has the little red joystick in the keyboard which works nicely too. Good stuff!

  Lenovo i5 Idea pad 3 2021 (new): My computer literacy rate is 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. This would be about the eighth laptop I have owned over 17 years and easily the worse. In that its ease of set seem to lock me out of the admin feature. So, I can't load programs on to it. The program does NOT give me a admin button. There are instructions on how to fix this online, but it's brand new I shouldn't have to do that - I gave it a good faith effort, but the quirks were too much. Among them is not giving the option of having no sign in password and having to give the computer an email. So my email (the one I gave at start up) shows up on screen every time it sleeps. Also, something I was willing to live with, the screen is bad and less clear than any screen I've had post 2002. It is grainy and is bright in a way that can't be fixed (I tried). I've never owned a chrome book (this is not a chrome book) but this is how I imagine they work. The feel is cheap, couldn't keep up with how much personal information and passwords it needed and there are tons of stuff being sold to you all the time. Adds all over every site I went to. A lot of security is based on you giving third party companies your information. I gave it a week, but not being able to use it as the administrator makes it useless to me (likely because of how I set it up??).  Don't buy this computer. I am off the Lenovo train.

  I ordered a laptop with Windows 10 Pro and instead, I got a laptop with Windows 10 Pro in S mode, which won't allow you to install ANY product that isn't sold on the Windows Store.  That means no Adobe Acrobat, Illustrator, Photoshop or AutoCad can be installed on this computer.  When you try to switch it out of S mode, it reverts to Windows 10 Home, which is NOT what I purchased and NOT as advertised.

  I was looking for a good ThinkPad on a budget and this fit the bill perfect.  I was looking at refurbed units until I stumbled upon this one priced only a little more.  My only hesitancy was it coming with a HDD rather than SSD but it's running fine so far and I'm still debating swapping a SSD in.  Processor, ram, and integrated graphics have been great for what I'm using it for.  (I wanted something portable I could do light gaming on rather than my huge desktop replacement MSI.)  For reference I haven't really tested the components too hard yet.. It's mostly been used for Rim World so far.  That is when the battery gets sucked down in a couple hours.From my researching, it sounded like the A series was on par with the T series.  That was a big deciding factor to go with this one.

  I purchased this laptop to run an open source operating system on it called MidnightBSD.  It required some tweaking to the boot loader.conf in order to get it to boot.  Once it did, everything seemed to work except the wifi card.  I'm using an external usb adapter with it.  The network adapter detects as two and the second port must be used with MidnightBSD. (re1)I also had initially booted it into windows to get it registered and make sure everything was working.  I found that in windows the performance was just OK. It seemed to run slower than it does on BSD.  I'm wondering if the power profile is not quite right for the ryzen CPU in windows that ships with it.  It might be worth trying to install the AMD chipset drivers on the unit to see if it improves performance.I found that it shows fingerprints very easily.  This is quite noticeable by the trackpad and keyboard.  The keyboard itself is one of the best to type on I've found on recent laptops though.  It's not as mushy as some of the other brands.It's a good value overall.

  All and all it's a great laptop for the price range, but I do feel I have to mention a problem with the WIFI hardware so everyone can make a wise decision while having all the facts in-front of them.I have used the laptop for 2 weeks before giving this review.PROS: Speedy performance. High-quality speakers. The shape of the laptop is wonderful, cut edges and smooth finish will make your eyes shine.The touchscreen is the best, works great with no glitches.When you change from laptop to tablet mode it will adjust the screen to the position you are setting it at, no matter the position.Photos, videos and pretty much everything you are looking at on this screen looks great!VOLTAGE: 110-240v, this means it will work worldwide with the proper adapter, but keep in mind it is a US plug and comes with a 3 pin (prongs) plug, meaning the bottom prong is in the way when you want to use an adapter, so I have removed the 3rd (bottom) prong to make it fit the adapter and it works perfectly, but if you can then get an adapter that will fit all 3 prongs, that will be the best option.CONS: A mentioned, there is only one thing i am not happy with and that is the WIFI:The WIFI connection drops every once in a while, which makes me disconnect and connect again.On my old laptop it never used to happen, but with this laptop the WIFI just stops randomly and without even telling me it is not working. Let's say i am watching a video o or listing to Spotify, it will start buffering out of nowhere which makes me disconnect and re-connect, and that is quite the bummer. so either wait for a few minutes or disconnect and reconnect.This was my 2 cents, hope this helps.

  I bought this laptop for my son, brand new! When he received it, it was not working. The charging light comes on, but the screen does not, it  is""blank"" ... a black screen.My son studies in India, took the laptop to the Lenovo showroom and he was told, even with the international warranty it is best to return the laptop, and buy another laptop from Lenovo showroom in India. International warranties mean nothing and there is a lot of ""red tape""! So best just to return it .. as told by the Lenovo  showroom rep in India!When my son told me this, I contacted Amazon immediately, but it has been a nightmare to return this product.I have all the return labels, but cannot ship the laptop from India back to the United States.DHL, DTDC and FedEx won't take the return even though I am willing to pay the return shipment fees. And DTDC also said I have to pay DUTY!Duty on an item I am returning, which is defected and not working.In the last 5 days I have been running to the various courier service providers in a country which is badly affected with COVID-19, and having explained all this to Amazon customer service they are unwilling to extend the return-by-date-deadline. I am very disappointed with Lenovo and Amazon. I have been a long time personal and business customer of amazon and did not expect this from them.

This laptop is missing nothing that I can relay here...I am very happy with all it has to offer. A couple of small gripes is the keyboard back-lite is pretty dim, even on the brightest setting. And the speakers, well, they sound like laptop speakers. No big deal, I bluetooth my headsets and all is well.

  Lacked a valid Win Home license. Confirmed this lack of license with 3 hours of MS tech support. Notified seller, but seller would not budge.

  I love my IdeaPad Slim 7 so much that I kept it EVEN THOUGH it is NOT touch screen as advertised in the description. That is my only dislike, but as I was on the fence about touch screen anyway I chose to keep this device. If you have strong feelings about wanting a touch screen, do not purchase this model.

  I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying that I am not one to leave negative reviews. I run two businesses and have worked in marketing for years, so I recognize that things sometimes go wrong in a business and that‚Äôs just how it is. There are off days, bad employees, and faulty products if a business is doing a decent amount of sales.But it‚Äôs how a company responds to those faults that shows integrity.Lenovo failed to show integrity and trustworthiness again and again.On October 7, my old computer failed. It was dramatic and fast. Like I said, I run two businesses - one is completely online. So I quickly researched and asked around and found Lenovo continually touted as one of the best brands and the Ideapad to be known as a solid computer. I ordered the computer directly from Lenovo on October 8 to be overnighted.The first day I had the computer (Oct 9), I noticed that the touchpad wasn‚Äôt working correctly. And the screen started randomly blacking out. I gave the computer a few days to see if the issues were persistent - and they were.I tried to call tech support on Oct 14 but couldn‚Äôt get through - even during their listed hours. I scheduled a call with them the next day, Oct 15. Someone called me around the time I scheduled to ask me what the problems were - then informed me that a technician would call me back in the next 24 hours. I was upset because I am a busy person and had scheduled this call‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt going to be sitting in front of my computer for the next 24 hours. But I rearranged my schedule‚Ä¶ Only to not get a call. I had to call them on Oct 16. He reinstalled the drivers and told me to call back in a few days if the issue continued. I told him, while on the call, that the issue was still happening post reinstalling the drivers. He told me to just wait.This should have been a sign of what the following month would hold.On Oct 18, I called customer service to ask for a replacement. They told me to call sales the next day. I called sales and they immediately forwarded me to customer service.Now, mind you, every time you have to talk to customer service, you have to sit on hold for at least an hour unless you call first thing when they open - which happens to be 6 am for me.This customer service rep put in a request for a replacement and told me I should receive a call or email within 24-48 hours from my case manager to tell me they were shipping the replacement. I asked if I needed to send the old one back first. They said no. I asked if it would be overnighted because that‚Äôs what I paid for. They said yes.Two days later, no word. I called back and was told those were business hours. So 3 to 5 days.A week later, still nothing. I reached back out. No updates.A few days later, I talked to someone and they said there were mistakes in the original order and had to resubmit. He gave me his email address and said he‚Äôd email me with updates.Two weeks later and a number of calls requesting updates later, still nothing. I emailed the rep and he opened the email (I have email tracking) but he never replied.I started reaching out to Lenovo on social media. Others started to tag them on my channels.Originally, the social media team was just telling me that they were just sending notes to my case manager. The same thing customer service reps said.But then, a Twitter rep told me I needed to send the computer back. This is a MONTH after I requested a replacement. And then someone from their TikTok team said the same thing. And that day, I mysteriously got an RMA that no one could confirm until the following week.The RMA was apparently the sign that the replacement was being sent. Originally it was to be here on Oct 18, but it didn‚Äôt even ship until that date. Oh, and despite me checking THAT WEEK that it would be overnighted.. It arrived on Oct 21.The RMA told me I had 10 days from the issue date of the RMA to return the computer. The return email I finally got said 5 days from receiving the computer. One rep said 30 days from the ship date of the replacement. Another said 10 days.I just sent it back the day I got the replacement.This whole time, my businesses were suffering. My productivity was down. I couldn‚Äôt take client calls because my computer was faulty. I told Lenovo this - they didn‚Äôt care.I have the replacement now. It seems to be working fine. I like the computer when it works. But the company is the worst company I have ever worked with. I would not trust their refunds, replacement, warranties - ANYTHING.If you are able to get a computer that works and never deal with them, then it‚Äôs fine. But don‚Äôt waste your money on a warranty because you will not want to send the computer to them. You‚Äôll never get it back.This company is literally the worst.

  It is quite good for what you pay for it.The cpu is awesome. It is very light. The keyboard is great, I miss the backlit though. The mousepad is wonky, the scrolling is bad.

The screen resolution is great, the screen brightness is not, but you can tweak it easily.It has room for a 2.5"" unit and you can replace memory on one slot, it takes a 16gb module fine so you can push it to a higher spec with less than 150 extra.Almost no bloatware preinstalled and windows pro comes from factory.

  I knew I'd be getting a TN screen, which is fine for what I purchased this laptop for (conference room), but holy crap is that a bad screen. Even a cheap 200$ laptop from 10 years ago has better contrast. Trackpad is pretty atrocious too. Users of this machine in my shop won't be looking at the screen for long, nor using the trackpad - so it's fine for this use case, but you could not pay me to daily drive this.

  ¬†The device itself is kinda fine, but I'm having a really bad fan noise when rotating the laptop. After disassembling, I found lots of fingerprints inside the laptop. It was looking as a new, clean and fine, but inside there was a mess. And the fan is making some noises, which scared me a lot, but after checking what's inside, I found only that the fan wasn't centered well enough. Can't replace, as I'm in another country now, and repair will most likely be not free. :-(Only the right fan does this. And I've replaced 2 fans so far - looks like the problem is serial.Also, when you switch videos to fullscreen from slack or discord, the whole screen goes blue. It's a driver issue, but Lenovo doesn't care, and told be to reinstall system/apps/drivers. I told them I did - they just do ""meh, not our problem"" and refuses to release updated drivers that are not 6 months old.Lenovo support also was extremely lazy when it came to bios update - I was unable to get a newer bios version until I've reinstalled windows from the stock. Why the hell would they restrict bios updates to windows patches?And why can't I set anything up in bios itself? As a sysadmin and developer this is ridiculous.

  My model is slightly different. It has the 2700 cpu and 512gb ssd. Though I did not purchase this item through amazon. I did purchase it directly from Lenovo. Build quality is good. I purchased this because I like the style (slim and light) and the price was very good compared to others I looked at.The laptop is reasonably fast and I had no problem connecting it with Bluetooth devices and a TV with a separately purchased usb-c to hdmi dongle. Battery seemed to last a decent amount of time and for the limited time I used it there were few issues. Except some major ones. There are video glitches that could not be overcome. There were bios and driver problems. Apparently the bios was not compatible with certain version updates of windows. These issues have been documented online and in Lenovos forums.After numerous attempts to correct these issues by myself (no luck) I called tech support. After describing the issue the tech took control and tried to update the bios. After this failed he issued a ticket and i returned the laptop. This was on June 12th. Lenovo states they have a 9 day turnaround time. They recieved the laptop on June 20th. Since that time they have not communicated the delays. Only when i make an inquire will i get a canned response requesting my patience.I spoke numerous with Lenovo and they have indicated they would escalate the matter and someone would communicate with me. They did not. On July 12th i spoke with someone who again said they would escalate the matter. I indicated they had already done they .Their response was "" my notes dont show that"" I asked for a supervisor and after a few times on hold was told non was available that someone would contact me within 3 days. I am not confident that they will.  And by the way i payed for the extra warranty......I post this here because i found no avenue to post this anywhere at Lenovo. Similar complaints have not been addressed on thier forum but simply ignored. I also post this so someone else does not have to go through this.Bottom line is..... I bought a laptop and warranty from Lenovo that did not and has not worked as advertised. Thier customer service is terrible. there is no way i could have any confidence in this product even if they return it.  I am sorry Lenovo i will look elsewhere.

  As with one of the other reviewers leaving a 1 star review, I purchased my ideapad directly from Lenvo, but cannot find anywhere else to leave a review, so I'm posting it here in hopes of saving future customers from the stress and hassle I've been through. I'm having the same issues as some of the other people complaining. Loud fan, some overheating, and video issues- mostly blue screens with video driver errors.The computer is under warranty, so I attempted to go through the proper troubleshooting, but after countless online troubleshooting and sending off my laptop 4x's the issue still isn't fixed. We tried escalating to managers, but they don't return our calls, and one's voice mail is full. I also tried @'ing them on twitter in hopes of resolving the issue, but they treated me like I was a 85 year old grandmother who didn't know how to open an email. (I'll add a picture of the screen shot from one of the messages. They suggested my blue screen errors were me clicking on video which had been deleted and therefore nothing would play, as if I didn't have enough common sense to know the difference between when a video is deleted and therefore nothing is playing, and a complete blue screen with a error message that says ""video_schedule_internal_error"" which makes my computer reboot).Looking around at similar complaints, this seems to be a common issue and simply isn't going to get resolved, so they're basically just trying to stall for time until my warranty runs out. I'm furious at not only their bad business practices in general, but at their fake troubleshooting as they blatantly ignore (or at least don't own up to) issues with their drivers/bios.

  Buyer Beware of the Lenovo 720S with Ryzen Mobile! It's only single-channel DDR4 2133 or (2400) NOT-UPGRADEABLE. At first sight, it seems great, since it's a small, slim and light 13.3"" model with nice looks.However, for anyone looking forward for this model's gaming capabilities please keep in mind that Lenovo completely butchered this laptop's gaming capability but using only single-channel RAM soldered to the board, with no option to add a second DIMM for dual-channel. Gaming and ram intensive work results for this model will be pretty terrible.

  I have been wanting a convertible for some time and as a computer professional, I know Lenovo is a well-respected technology company that got their start making Thinkpads for IBM many years ago. When I saw this Yoga 13 for sale at a good price, even though it was a refurb, I decided to take the plunge.I have had several refurbs in the past but those have always been from the D*** Outlet and never once had an issue. Naively, I assumed that this was a Lenovo factory refurb and that was my mistake. A third party to the selling vendor did the refurb and it definitely was not up to Lenovo factory standards.The look and feel of the Yoga 13 was outstanding, thin and lightweight. It promptly booted up thanks to an Intel i5 CPU and a 128 GB SSD. When Windows prompted me to ""Activate"", it would not accept the Product Key because it was not valid. Looking further into the software, none of the Lenovo software was installed or present indicating to me that this was a generic Window 8 reimaging of the laptop and was not specifically designed for the Lenovo Yoga 13. Further, the reimaging did not use a proper configuration of Windows 8 which would have included a unique Product Key but rather they used one Product Key for many different laptops and Microsoft probably recognized the first laptop that activated but after that, they began denying anyone else who tried to activate. Basically, it was a software piracy issue and I do not blame Microsoft for protecting their brand.Also, I could not simply change the Product Key as is the usual case with most Windows installations. Something about the reimaging process did not allow this procedure.I did work with the vendor's tech support people and they offered to refund my money and were very courteous but would not just send me a valid license for Win 8. Since I really like this ultrabook, I decided to keep the product but that would mean I have to purchase a new copy of Win 8 in order to use this computer for longer than 30 days.Evidently, good karma came my way because another person from the vendor's customer satisfaction department called quickly credited my credit card for the cost of a new license for Windows 8. May faith in Internet shopping is restored.Once I reinstalled Windows 8, installed the appropriate Yoga 13 drivers which I downloaded from their website, I was in business.This is a solid well built ultrabook that has a touchscreen that can be used in regular laptop mode, folded back and setup as a movie screen or folded back all the way so that it can be used as a tablet. Very cool.I plan on upgrading the RAM from 4 to at least 8 gb and I may eventually upgrade the SSD from 128 GB to 256 GB. The Lenovo Yoga 13 Users Manual (get it from the Lenovo website) has detailed instructions on how to do this and there are videos on YouTube on how to do this as well.I plan to use this as my training device to help me learn Windows 8 which I really do no like but realize that I have to eventually come to accept the inevitable.Another well-built Lenovo product.*********** Update ***************7/25/2014Upgraded RAM to 8 GB and switched the SSD hard drive from 128 GB to 256 GB. Very good laptop / tablet. I like it alot with the exception of Windows 8.1 but I am getting used to it. I did add one of the many Windows Start button restorer addons and that makes it much better to use. The size and feel are nice. Lenovo does make good products.

  I have had this laptop for several months now, and have been using it almost daily.  I feel this is a great laptop, and really appreciate the sleek, elegant design.  Windows 8 was fine, since I installed one of the free Start menu programs, and I generally bypass the Metro screen, so it runs almost like Windows 7, which I like.The laptop runs well, is speedy with all activties. I do a good bit of internet browsing/downloading, Arduino and C programming, and it has kept up with me well.  Screen is beautiful as well.  Don't use the touch screen much, but the other day I was looking at a document, and couldn't quite read the text, so I just touched he screen and used the ""pinch expand"", and it enlarged it - COOL!  I have tested out the other laptop modes (tablet, wedge, etc), and they're interesting, but generally I just use it as a really sleek ultrabook and will reserve those other modes for occasional use.The keyboard does have a very shallow key travel, but this does not bother me.  Fan is audible at times, but generally very quiet.Pros:very nice screen (with touch)speedy processormultiple configurations (laptop, tablet, wedge, tent)nice touchpadvery thinlightweightquite sturdy design** expandable RAM and can add an additional mSATA SSD (very big plusses for me) **Cons:only 2 USB ports (had to use a USB hub at times)wifi range is not stellar, but good enough (I have a very weak wifi signal at my office, which one of my other laptops can barely connect to)no kensington cable lock port - I had to use a ""slide tab under the screen hinge"" security cable which works well.I highly recommend this laptop!

  Now I am pretty tech sauvy & I usually go with what I know. This time around I went with the great reviews regarding this hybrid.I was looking for a Tablet / Laptop. This one peaked my interest. So I bought it.Ironically I rarely used this as a tablet position.At just over $1000 I expected much more from this device. If I were to have stuck with a ASUS & spent that kind of money I would have gotten a device with twice the power & much bigger screen.My machine did not have the wifi issues I see others were having. However after just a couple of months use I noticed lag time increasing while only using my browsers. Yes I had a couple of larger programs installed, Adobe Fireworks & Dreamweaver. But the lag still appeared while these programs were inactive.I reset my device back to factory settings, but still the slow down was still evident.I purchased new RAM & upped it to 8 gigs. That did not help at all.I followed advice regarding my YOGA from the lenovo forums & from knowledgeable tech sites. But my device is still lagging even when every custom app & program is un-installed.When ever I go to a site that is Flash based, I cant even open another browser page because of the horrible lag. My INTERNET is fine I have other computers running okay on it. When I disconnect from the INTERNET & turn off my connection completely I still get lagged out.A completely factory reset pc with extra ram & nothing installed & this all on a computer that is just 1 year old, yet it still lags.Seriously, save your money.If you need a Tablet, then buy a tablet, While the concept looks cool, it's practicality just isn't worth the extra bucks, use that & buy a faster more reliable laptop with a touch screen.I will be staying away from Lenovo for now.

  I've had the laptop for about a week now and it is great. Lenovo products are built well. 16gb of RAM and 500gb for this price was a good deal. Screen looks great.No blaring issues have shown up so far. Only two gripes. There is no lid lip, meaning there is no lip for opening up the laptop. Makes it a little harder to open, but not the end of the world. Other gripe is the keyboard. This is a personal gripe, but the keyboards on Lenovo products are weird. They are kind of mushy and the soft plastic feeling doesn't feel great.I will update this review in a few months.

  I needed something for my son to replace an older Asus weird tablet computer thing with a keyboard that detached and would only charge when it was in the ""stored"" position, not in the forward facing usable position.  Wasn't a bad system, but he hated the trackpoint (as do I) and the touch screen just wasn't that good.I've used Lenovo for years, and IBM for a couple decades prior to that, before the Lenovo spinoff.  Some of them have been disappointing, but this one was an outstanding choice for my kid.I was able to find a holiday special where Lenovo had them for half off, and bought direct from the Microsoft store online.  Arrived quickly, and I was off.I have a 20GB zip file of things I install on my computers, and while most are only for my personal laptop, a lot of them are used everywhere.  And the very first thing I noticed here was how fast the SSD was on this laptop.  It screamed, I copied that 20GB zip file over a USB C port faster than even my $2500 Dell Inspiron XPS 13 can...Extracted, began the installs, and that drive was fast.  Everything I did, just flew, whether copying back files I backed up from his old computer, installing things from the Zip file, or even copying things over my AC network.The hinge works well, I have no points where anything binds, it's smooth and fluid, but holds position where you stop.  So in laptop mode, any angle works, in tent mode, again any angle works.  In tablet mode it's comfortable.  I know some people don't like the feel of loose chicklet keyboards on the back of a convertible computer, it bugs them.  Never bothered me, and having had things like the Thinkpad that flipped like that and then the keys locked in place so you did NOT feel them moving - made no difference to me or anyone I knew...Has a backlit keyboard, which I hadn't known when I bought it, but works like all Lenovo backlights do - function and space bar, set low, high, or off.  Seems to work fine, I had no keys that were too dark, everything seemed uniform.This is also one of the quieter 2 in 1 convertibles I've dealt with - very little fan noise even when I was doing processor intensive things like unzipping that huge 20GB zip file.  Long installs, all the windows updates, doing some test games, it stayed cool (even on my lap, never got even mildly uncomfortable) and quiet.  I made sure everything was set for high performance when on battery, and never had it experience any issue because of that.Screen is well done - that's one thing I've always liked with any Lenovo I had, the screens are usually great.  Good contrast, good black levels, and adjusting it lets you easily work with it at half brightness, no need to suck battery in torch mode to have it look good and be usable.Keyboard is about standard for the chicklet style, comfortable for me, and lets me speed type easily.  My son is a hunt and peck typist, so for him it's definitely no issues.I miss the volume rocker switches that convertibles like this used to have, so the only volume control is either keyboard or touchscreen.The touch screen works well, accurate with no false inputs.  The surface is smooth enough that your finger doesn't get sticky and jump around.  Multitouch has worked just fine.The 256 GB SSD will hold things my son needs, since he's still using google docs and the cloud for his homework, so all he needs locally are some games and music and movie files.  But this gives him room to breathe, unlike the smaller 128GB drives that fill up so quick, especially considering how much Windows can end up taking.My only issue was the warranty showed 7 months expired already by the time I received it.  I spent two days with numerous phone calls, emails, and tech support chats to get that straightened out.  Other than that, I can't find anything I'm not happy with, and my son absolutely LOVES it.

  An excellent variety in the Lenovo Yoga product line.  Screen is bright and clear.  Great sound too.  Set up was very easy.  A great value, given the low price for this hard working, durable machine.  My only regret - it has only one USB port.  Not 2 or 3 like other models.

  The description of this laptop clearly states ""300nits Anti-glare Touchscreen Display"". It is not!

  Screen is perfect, clear vivid and good contrast. It could have more memory but this is not for gaming, or graphic design. I wish it have keyboard backlight. But In turn, mine came with fingerprint reader and thats a plus because if you turn it on with your registered finger, it caches the read and login automatically into Windows when it asks for a finger, thats cool for me. Be aware that Is not touch screen... Is powerful enough to everyday tasks and making DevOps and cloud jobs (git, vscode, jira etc etc etc.) But it cannot handle well Docker desktop and so under Windows. Battery life is long. More than 8 hours. And thats what I was looking for when I take my laptop out of my house. My MSI GF65 is way more powerful but the battery wont last more than 2 hours. Is a pretty descent machine for students or non power users. If you are not looking for a rocker machine, and a lightweight, powerful enough long lasting battery is enough for your. Go for it!

  I am very pleased with the functionality of this computer. For the average user it will far exceed your needs and perhaps lead you to learning more of what a great tool a computer can be.

  UPDATE: the seller provided a prepaid label. It took about 2 weeks for them to fix and return it. It had the power cable but was missing a couple other cables and wires that came with it and that we had sent back with the unit.Overall, we are happy with the purchase.Received quickly, BUT no network drivers are installed. We can't connect to internet. Downloaded drivers on phone & jump drive, but system won't let ""unapproved"" files run without going to internet. Item received Friday. Customer service only available M-F 9-5, so sent email. Will update review depending on response.

  Everything I dislike about this laptop is about the laptop itself. This seller threw in a fun bonus of 20G of RAM, but at the end of the day, you're paying over $600 for a $350 laptop.The actual laptop is just horrid. It's cheap and flimsy, with a God awful screen. Lenovo definitely cut corners on this one, and the base laptop (without this Amazon seller's upgrades) can be found for around $350-$400. I'm not sure how expensive RAM is, but that leaves about $300 for an upgrade of, I believe it was 8G, up to a whopping 20G.Also, the laptop doesn't have touch screen capabilities like it was advertised. The battery lasts a total of 39 MINUTES when going from full to dead; my last GAMING PC lasted at least an hour! It's incredibly light weight, but it translates to FLIMSY over ""practical"". There's nothing I like about this laptop other than its upgrades, and to pay $679 just for the upgrades didn't fit my agenda. I ultimately returned it a month after owning it.The laptop might be good for just school work or business work, but definitely wouldn't be good for gaming, video/photo editing, portability, touch screen usage, or anything that requires a decent screen or uncharged use. The laptop itself is a .5 star out of 5, but the seller is not to blame for these issues, hence the higher rating.

  It was great and perfect.  For seven days.  Today it quit working for no apparent reason.  Just shut off right in the middle of one of my son's lessons.  I inquired about this with seller and the instructions were fractured and vague at best, and now I cannot reply to that message.  I would prefer to have it fixed, but may just return it instead.

  UPDATE:This laptop is now 4 years old, and still running stong. I'm running Windows 10 now, and I've upgraded the RAM, and switched from a HDD to a SSD. It's been running everyday, for about 12 to 18 hours daily - sometimes more, rarely less. No gaming, but plenty of heavy work such as MATLAB, COMSOL etc. The only issue that has come up, which is honestly to be expected, is the battery, which now gives about 2 hours worth of use (that's what the system approximates anyway).Original Review:I've had this laptop for about a year and a half now, and I have used it everyday since I bought it.I have never had any issues related to software or hardware; everything is still working as it should.For $650, the laptop had a 500 GB HDD, 4 GB RAM, 1366 x 768 14.0"" matte display and Intel Integrated Graphics (I would really recommend trying to get a higher resolution screen). It came with Windows 7 Professional, and I upgraded that Windows 10 Pro. I do find that the laptop, and programs were slightly faster with Win7 as the OS, though.Ports include: VGA (D-Sub); Microphone/headphone combo; Mini DisplayPort; 2 x USB 3.0; 2 x USB 2.0 (including one specially designed for fast charging); SD card reader.The only hardware modifications I've made are adding an 8 GB stick of RAM for a total of 12 GB (out of a maximum of 16 GB), and swapping out the CD drive for an HDD caddy, and putting a Samsung 840 EVO SSD there. That SSD stores my main programs and OS. The original HDD stores everything else. Getting access to the components is really easy; just remove 2 screws on the bottom, and the cover slides right off. Immediate access to HDD, 2 RAM slots and wireless card.Just browsing the internet alone, I manage to get about 5 - 6 hours. That range is dependent on what exactly I'm doing on the internet (watching YouTube videos drain the battery faster than just reading web pages). If the CD drive is under constant use, expect less battery life. Having only the SSD in the laptop, while not using the CD drive can lengthen battery life (SSD uses less power than HDD).So, on to everything I don't like about this laptop.1) For a 14.0"" laptop, it's noticeably and significantly heavy (almost 5 lbs) and bulky (over an inch thick). (-0.5 star)2) No wireless AC; only wireless-N. A wireless AC card can be purchased, however, and installed with ease.3) No hardware switches for toggling wireless; this must be done while the laptop is on, and using Fn + F8. Additionally, No indication lights for things such as hard drive activity, or battery status/charging status. (-0.5 star).Things other people may not like:4) Keyboard: Function keys are integrated with multimedia keys. Default operation is multimedia. For example: To decrease or increase the volume, you press the F2 or F3 keys respectively. To activate the functions of F2 or F3 however, you need to press the function button (Fn) THEN press F2 or F3. You can also press Fn + Esc to 'lock' the Fn button, so that you only need to press F2 or F3 to get the functions of F2 or F3.5) Touchpad: Many persons are not fans of the integrated design, where the buttons and trackpad are integrated into one. I have no problems with it.

  I have the business version of this Lenovo Thinkpad T440 at work and I wanted one of my own. Throughout my career I have had these Thinkpads many times from my employer. At home we tried Toshiba, Dell Inspirons (2!) and a Chromebook. All died inglorious premature deaths. I finally decided that I want what I want and I want a Thinkpad! Awesome decision. This is a spectacular workhorse. Includes DVD drive which is becoming increasingly rare these days but is extremely convenient when you want to load music or software programs. So the DVD drive adds a touch more weight (my office Thinkpad is around 1 lb) it's worth it.PROS - battery life, durability, display, Windows 7 OS (Win 8 sucks), processing speed, etc.CONS - Win 7 OS. I miss the lightening speed of powering up the Chromebook. When will MSFT solve the problem?! Hate the Windows updates that unannounced take several minutes when powering off and then AGAIN when powering on. Last con is form factor. It's a black brick. Style and function have come a long way but the Thinkpad form factor is old and black and clunky. Please upgrade.OVERALL - an awesome MACHINE in every sense of that word. I love it and I'll buy it again but hopefully not for several years. :)

  Bought this just over 2 years ago. Used it for organizing music, browsing and photos. Hardware failed - critical error, cannot access anything on the laptop. Windows will not load. Operating system (windows) will not load. Worked with IT specialist who said laptop is as good as a paperweight. $580 and it only lasted just over 2 years!!  Will never buy a Lenovo again.

  I'm disappointed with this computer and will be replacing it as soon as possible. I specifically wanted a computer with a back-lit keyboard, and the specs said this one was. It's not. And apparently that's just the way it is - it doesn't come with a back-lit keyboard. So I bought another keyboard and replaced the one that came with the computer. Now I have a keyboard that isn't back-lit and has only one functional Control key.Weird things happen with this computer. Sometimes the cursor inexplicably jumps from the insertion point to someplace else in the document. Sometimes it doesn't save. I tried to rip CDs to the drive; it doesn't play some of them. I get alerts all the time that my C drive (444 GB is out of memory), but I have only documents on the computer - no movies, no pictures, no games. I bought this computer for business, but it slows me down regularly.I'd headed back to the reliable HPs that I used to use.

  This isn't really a Thinkpad and far from the old T-Series machines I have used. Its more in the family of Thinkpad Edge. The whole trackpad is messed up big time and something in design is not correct as I am just not being able to get accustomed to this machine. I have been using Thinkpad for years now and I bought this out of habit. If you are a thinkpad user, please don't buy this machine. Also, the CPU performance is at best average, and is poorer than one of my 8 year old thinkpad's. Bad buying decision.

  This computer gives Lenovo such a bad name. I had a T430P, which was fantastic, until it died. I replaced it with a T440P purchased through Amazon.In under 1 week, I've had 5 blue screens of death, a faulty wireless card, and a slew of other issues.Also, Amazon is misrepresenting this computer and won't do anything about it. The computer you're going to buy from this listing does NOT have a fingerprint scanner.I will never buy a computer from Amazon EVER again.

  this company brags about this laptop large capacity for gaming and memory. i run a small apparel & engraving business, i have two main software programs that are very small, one of which is silhoutte software very common, the laptop (in comparison to my wifes old dell laptop with less features) is so slow and it has a tendency in silhouttte and also online sometimes to glitch and suddenly close programs. the help line was of no help and so im stuck with it because i was late getting into using it and missed the 30 day return window. only plus is this laptop runs the laser software pretty well but otherwise its junk i wouldnt ever pyrchase from this company again.

  Like the SSD.Much thinner than my 5 yr old Toshiba, but would take thicker if it meant quieter or better reliability.Fan runs whenever the lid is open although it is multi-speed.Power cord is half the length of other laptops.There are no trap doors for memory or drive upgrades.I'll still be happy with it if the reliability is good.

  Great computer, great find for the price. I bought this for school with the intention of using it for full stack developing. This computer is very fast, I had no clue SSD would make so much of a difference! Starts up and shuts down within 10 seconds give or take. The 256GB storage works out, as the computer is ready to sync with Onedrive or the cloud storage of your choice. That being said though I may want to install a larger SSD down the line. Keys are well spaced out and responsive like the touchpad -- what one would expect from a Lenovo. Speakers are decent for personal use and intial setup is fast and without too much additional bloatware to install. I would describe the screen/resolution quality as basic - this definitely isn't your #1 HD laptop, but performance-wise you get more than enough for the price. I would've preferred a more durable screen as opposed to the soft screen, but once again, budget PC.The only issue I have with this computer is the backlight brightness. I've had it for about a week now and I've noticed flickering and changes in brightness while in use. I'm thinking at this point that this is most likely due to the aggressive battery saving mode re-adjusting the screen brightness,but plan on keeping an eye on it for issues.

  Great laptop does not have a lack of speed. Not the best graphics but good enough for everything but gaming. With this Laptop you get the 1920x1200 Full HD Anti-glare LCD which is bright and clear, and with the SSD you almost can click and Go instead of waiting for the sights to load. Go with SSD drive instead of the HDD and you will not be disappointed.

  I bought this computer to replace a Dell laptop, and I honestly don't think there is a comparison.  The Lenovo is so much better, I can hardly believe it.

  This is my third attempt at a new latptop this year, so I was hopeful that third time would be a charm. So sad. Arrived, booted (a step up from the last two duds), installed windows, but had to do it without a mouse. Hoped it was just a driver issue. Downloaded and installed drivers, no mouse/trackpad found, so the drivers were installed but there was nothing to update. No trace of a mouse in the device manager or mouse settings. I tried everything that has ever worked on my other Windows laptops when this issue happened. After two hours fighting with it, I realized it wasn't going to work and it wasn't worth it for something I just spent $700 on and should work out of the box. So sad, because it seemed like it would fit my needs perfectly otherwise. Back to crossing my fingers that the laptop that's on its last legs won't die before I try to order something again.

  I bought this for gaming, it runs red dead redemption 2 and Grounded on high settings flawlessly. I recommend setting your max processor state to 85% which will prevent any and all throttling or overheating issues as well as give your cpu a longer lifespan. Speakers are decent and quite loud, the weight and size are comparable to any other laptop meaning it doesn't stand out like other gaming laptops at all. When I'm not gaming on it, the fans are  quiet. But they are as loud as any other laptop when gaming unfortunately, nothing that can be done about it and not the sellers fault. The fan intake is on the bottom,which would make cooling pads more effective but trust me they won't be needed at 85% processor state. It came packaged nicely and arrived a day early, 100% recommend for anyone looking for a portable gaming machine or engineering students using AutoCAD or other software.

  ¬†I bought this gaming laptop for my sister through this listing, which was shipped by Valinor Tech. A short time after she started to notice a glitch (see video)  that would happen with the screen. A part of the top left section would seem distorted until the mouse was dragged over the area. I returned the defective product for a full refund within the allotted time I'm allowed to do so. However,  Valinor Tech still took out over $100 from the refund for a 'restocking fee'. It makes no sense that I have to pay the price for a defective product, and when I disputed the claim, Valinor Tech said these types of errors have to be reported within the first 14 days, and I took too long, which is stupid and infuriating even though I returned it in time. They also said that they checked it and they did not see a glitch. So now it's my word against theirs even though there is a video to prove it.So thanks for nothing Valinor Tech. Next time, make sure your products break faster so people can get the refund they deserve.

  For context: the laptop I had prior to this was a $200 HP that couldn't run more than 3 tabs of Chrome at once, so anything was going to be an improvement.The features I mainly use my laptop for are:-work (spreadsheets, Chrome tabs, designs on Canva, InDesign, etc.)-art (making pixel art in Photoshop and Aseprite)-gaming (Night in the Woods, Stardew Valley, Among Us, etc. The heaviest game I've run is Sims 3.)-meetings (Google Meet & Zoom)-writing (short stories & fiction)Immediately this laptop was a massive improvement. The keyboard is SO pleasant. It's backlit blue, which you can turn on and off. It has a numpad which is great if you work with spreadsheets/data. The responsiveness of the keys is satisfying. The touchpad has a good click, though it has no buttons (I like this, but others may not).Laptop runs beautifully. Startup is fast, runs multiple pages of Chrome no problem, and even loads up Adobe Creative Cloud as quickly as the desktop I have at work. If you want more speed, the 8GB RAM is upgradeable according to other reviewers. I'm considering it, but right now I have no need.The screen is matte and does a good job of reducing glare - not to mention the size is great for gaming, and the display, while a tiny bit muted, works just fine for the type of graphic design and pixel art I do.This is a gaming laptop, and the games I've run so far are so smooth and so easy to play. I have no input lag and I can run them on the highest graphics settings. To be fair, I don't play more intensive games, so I can't speak to that. But lighter games run smoothly and very well.My only 3 complaints about this laptop I have so far (I've had it about 2 weeks) are: the weight, the fan noise, and the battery. It's a little bit heavier than I'm used to carrying, but if you have it in a protective sleeve in a backpack, I doubt it'll be much of an issue. Just be prepared for thickness and a little bit of heftiness. The fan noise is my biggest problem. I was on a Google Meet call yesterday and within a couple of minutes, the fan kicked on and was pretty loud. It hardly ever runs, but the laptop does feel warm after a bit of use. I wouldn't recommend using this laptop in bed or anywhere it can't get good ventilation. And lastly, the battery life is a little bit shorter than I'd like it to be. It lasts a couple of hours, which is good, but be prepared to keep your charger with you if you're taking it outside your home.If you're like me, even budget laptops (below $1000) don't feel very ""budget."" Anything that costs more than $500 has me pretty hesitant. Rest assured, I've looked at laptops for probably eight months before committing to this one. So far, it's been worth the investment, and if you want a computer that can handle a number of tasks without lag or sluggishness, I'd highly recommend the Lenovo L340.

  Works great for older smaller games. Battery life short for gaming but just keep it plugged in. Some games I play on there that run fine (possible light adjustments to graphics) No Mans sky, bioshock 2, half life, amount us (obvi), fnaf, and more. All ran great. I love this laptop

  ¬†Received the laptop and it looks nice. Solid weight, the keyboard has a bit of flex to it which is concerning but not unexpected at this price point. 1 star because the Trakpad/built in Mouse was dead on arrival. I have sunk 4 hours into trying to fix it based on Lenovo form, re-installing drivers, restarting, resetting, to no avail. What a shame. This laptop is cheap, but not cheap enough to justify me keeping it. Returning in The morning.

  While the specs are the same as the laptop  I had to replace the specs  don't reflect reality. The  screen is  hazy at the recommended 125%. I haven't tried to game and I won't bother. No amount of changing settings has made a difference.

  I am a photographer that doesn't want to spend $2000 for a laptop so I bought this one. I most often use my desktop but I will be out of town longer than I thought. This is a fine computer for what I need on the road except... I'm trying to find the sweet spot...the place were the screen matches the printer. If I move my head up or down just an inch the screen changes. If I move to the side the image disappears. It seems you are using ""70s technology so you can save money.

  I use it for email, ordering stuff, watching videos, tuning my guitar, and whatever else comes along. So far it has been very good. It came with Windows 10 S but 10 S limits which apps you can download so I removed 10 S back to just 10 . The instructions to do this were glued to the outside of the box! I had to cut the box to add the paper to the documents I am saving. I don't know what the advantages of 10 S are and when you remove it you can't bring it back. I had to remove it to use my McAffe security software.

  Disclaimer: I am a serious computer geek and a bit of a snob when it comes to tech. Still, this laptop is awesome!!Rating: 5 Stars (because 4.8 isn't an option and 4 is too few for this thing)Model: 12 GB RAM; Ryzen 5 3500UPros:> That price! (Unmatched in performance in this price range!)> Ryzen 5 3500U performs better than the Intel Core i5-8250U.> Vega 8 graphics are fairly capable.> Backlit keyboard is nice and a pleasure to type on> Light and portable> Great port selection.> 12 GB of RAM is sufficient for most daily tasks. (Expandable to 20 GB if your the warranty voiding type)> Decent sound for its class> Comes with a pen that works very well with the software> Great touchscreenCons:> Can't charge via USB-C (Lenovo! Please do this for the next model!!)> Screen brightness is sufficient, but not suitable for outdoor use.> Pen stores very awkwardly (Lenovo! You can really do better!)> McAfee preinstalled, and it resists being uninstalled. (You actually need to download their uninstaller to do it. IMHO its more of a virus than an antivirus.)> Battery life is definitely OK. Its not a super long lasting battery but I seem to get 5 hours out of it at a time (in balanced mode and dimming the brightness a bit - honestly, you get what you pay for.My take: I bought this laptop for graduate school. I wanted something I could use to take written notes as well as use to do all my assignments. It needed to be portable, fairly lightweight, all while not compromising on performance. This laptop fit my needs on paper. Now, after using it (practically daily) for a month, I can say its a pleasure to use. It boots up in seconds (like less than 20), and has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor. My other laptop is a Thinkpad X1 Extreme, which I intended to be a powerhouse (32 GB RAM, i7-8850H, 4K, GTX-1080Ti Max-Q). Honestly, this laptop puts my ""powerhouse"" to shame in many ways. The Flex 14 boots up QUICKER, has less graphical errors when switching between desktops, and has a brighter back-light on its keyboard. Of course the Flex 14 can't run a virtual lab environment comprising of 4 machines like my Thinkpad Extreme, but it sure can run 2 VMs simultaneously (at least on the 12 GB RAM config). This laptop is SO good for the price I'm honestly shocked that it is not listed in the best laptops of 2019 list on YouTube or Google - its really a great find. Thank you Amazon!TLDR: This laptop is amazing. If you're a student, someone who seeks a 2 in 1 experience, a person who doesn't want to pay $800+ for a laptop and needs something portable yet powerful enough to get actual work done, this is the laptop for you.

  I received this computer on Thursday, marked brand new. 20 minutes after setting up part of my screen glitched up and became pixelated. I gave it a little while and it was fine even though it did it again at other times. Tinkering around, I opened up the drawing pad only to discover there was a drawing already in there. Not a professional demo one, just something someone drew. I called up Amazon and asked if this was refurbished, they said no. I described the issues and they were nice and courteous and are sending out a replacement immediately. Until I receive a brand new one as promised, I will leave my review at 3 stars. It is a great computer, but this issue was a bit of a let down. Make sure you check your products before the 30 day mark expires.

  **GNU/Linux distribution notes at the end of this review.A very nice laptop and it feels premium. The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1"" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60"") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?)The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason.The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors.The touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write without immediately cramping my hand.The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%.4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FL4K FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen.  I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them.With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don‚Äôt care about the warranty. I‚Äôve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don‚Äôt tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so).The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates.Overall I‚Äôm happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15‚Äù Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work.EDIT 8/31/2020: I've been experimenting with GNU/Linux/Ubuntu distributions and I have a small list of what is NOT working with no additional modifications/installs. All of the images were flashed via Etcher (with verification) onto a PNY Elite Turbo Attache 4 and ran in live mode (no install).Tails OS 4.10 -  I was not able to connect a Bluetooth mouse (only Bluetooth device I had available) and it did not appear to allow Bluetooth to remain on after moving to another settings screen. The dual mapped function keys worked for brightness and sound.Debian 10.5.0 (Cinnamon) - I was not able to see any network, or even manually connect to one. The brightness function keys (F11 and F12) display the icon as if it is changing the display brightness, but the actual brightness of the display remains at 100%Linux Mint 20 (Cinnamon) - Probably the most compatible distribution with this laptop without any additional modifications. My Bluetooth mouse connected without issue (MUCH quicker than on Windows) and the dual mapped FN keys work as expected with the exception of the built-in webcam disable (F8)

  I really like the C13 Yoga. It is extremely well built. I like the display, keyboard and all the USB slots available. My 1 complaint would be the speakers are not good at all and should be much better for a higher end Chromebook. Other than that; I like its speed (I have the 5 with 8gb ram). I wish it would be able to log in with your fingerprint from the start of the computer, but using smartlock with my phone seems to work, most of the time. As I learn more and more about the Chromebook, I am seeing that I can do almost everything and more than with my Window's laptop. I need to learn how to use the stylus better. This is definitely a well made Chromebook, except for the lousy speakers. I am VERY happy with my purchase.

  If you're like me and obsessively research a product (especially a big purchase like a computer), this review is for you.I am a Chromebook fan and purchased this computer with the intention of primarily working within Google Docs, Google Photos and email. I have not tried to use Linux apps but am interested if it's useful. Otherwise, this was not intended to be a gaming machine or video editing computer. I currently use a Pixelbook, which still works fine, but was looking for something else that felt a little more sturdy and road worthy.I ended up purchasing the computer from Lenovo using an ADP perks website through work and got it for just over $600, including tax and free shipping. I was also looking at the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook, Acer Spin 713 and Pixelbook Go. The Galaxy Chromebook has a 4K display, but build quality didn't feel as durable and battery life wasn't great. The Acer Spin 713 is an excellent value but the C13 seemed like it was better built. The Pixelbook Go is nice but is already a couple of years old, has 8th gen Intel processors and is still $850 for the i5 model. You get much more value with something like this Lenovo.Pros:- quite nice, contrasty display- very sturdy full metal build- proper Thinkpad computer with Trackpoint cursor and buttons- internal fan hopefully means that this can utilize full processor capabilities- full 360 display hinge- battery life is pretty decentCons:- the speakers really are embarrassingly awful- the keyboard feels mushier than other Lenovo laptop keyboards- anodized case aesthetic is a finger print magnet- while study, it does feel noticeably heavier compared to other Chromebooks- the trackpad could be a little smoother- Lenovo's pricing is all over the place- the display is bright, but not as bright as others in the same price pointI'm still debating if I want to keep the computer or return it to Lenovo. Overall, it's nice and I think it's a great work computer, but just not sure if it's really as much of an upgrade from what I already have.

  When I started using this computer I thought that maybe there was a problem with my machine. The speakers are quieter and tinny-er than even my cellphone's speaker. I can barely hear my professor in class on Zoom. I don't bother even trying to listen to music anymore, it just sounds terrible. Its a shame because everything else about this computer is great. Maybe they can fix it with a driver update or something? I have been looking at other lenovo models' replacement speakers on ebay to see if there are any that might work as a replacement for the crappy ones in this computer. So frustrating. Also- I got the version with the 4k screen and I think the battery life suffers because of the faster processors. If you don't absolutely need it, get the slower one. Maybe the battery will last longer on those.

  I will start off by saying I was looking for a All-in-One laptop and with what's available right now, the Yoga 720 likely comes up top for a balance between specs and price. Performance wise, as with any laptop it depends on your usage. For my use (websurfing, youtube, edit/read documents, no games, basic photo edits) the specs it came with works awesome (i5 7gen, 8GB SSD). Boots quickly and generally responsive, speakers also good and loud enough. Touchscreen and trackpad work as they should, though I realized for Google Sheets you can't scroll up/down without using the sidebar. Sometimes the screen flickers so inconspicuously I thought my eyes were playing tricks, but apparently it can be fixed with a driver update. The unit I got also had a very slight defect on the exterior at a corner, but I was lazy to return it (YMMV).Overall a well performing and sleek laptop, the tablet configuration is a nice feature but how often you use it is another thing.

  Very happy with this 2-in-1 PC.  It is very slim, and reasonably lightweight.  It boots up very quickly, has a very nice display, and good Wi-Fi performance.  The fingerprint sensor works great in lieu of a login PW.  Operation in either PC or tablet mode is effortless, and the mode of operation automatically changes when you fold the unit back.  Unlike some of the other reviews, I found the audio quality of the speakers to be acceptable although the headphone audio quality is definitely better.  I have a few nits with the PC that did not affect my score.  The unit is actually a little hard to open.  It is so slim that there is very little gap to allow you to get your finger underneath to open it.  I also would have liked a second USB 3.0 port on the computer, but I bought an inexpensive adapter that fits in the USB-C port and provides 2 USB ports and an HDMI port.  The battery life is great (7 to 8 hours) if you use Battery Saver mode which does dim the display brightness some, but is still acceptable.  If you defeat Battery Saver mode, battery life can drop to 3 hours or a little more.  There is sometimes a little cursor lag, but that may be due to the fact that I am using a 2.4GHz wireless mouse that may experience some interference from other Wi-Fi transmissions.  This PC provides good performance and great versatility for the price!

  3 weeks after buying this laptop the mother board had to be replaced. a few weeks later a few keys stopped working. Dealing with Lenovo's customer service was a total nightmare. I was told 3 different stories to make me feel like I was being taking care of which none were meet by Lenovo since we needed this laptop for college they told me they would expedite the return of the laptop which should be 2 days and they shipped it standard which will take five days. Lenovo is a huge company you would think they would care about there customers better then I was treated. I will never buy another Lenovo product.

  So I looked at a lot of review sites to see what was considered a good laptop, and this brand from Lenovo was constantly highly rated. But one thing that NONE of those profession reviewers mentioned was the fan. This is by far the LOUDEST fan I have ever heard on any laptop. Its a god damn fighter jet going off.I've had a gaming laptop in past, and that thing got real hot and loud when i'd push 4k 60fps settings on games, and this tiny little laptop gets both hotter and LOUDER while doing.....nothing. Absolutely NOTHING. Freshly set up, nothing installed yet, nothing running, just sitting there roaring away like crazy.You'd think maybe I just got defective laptop, but when I went looking around at all different forums, seems everyone has this problem. And don't think it can be fixed either. The only options are to basically limit how much fan runs, which basically results in a hotter laptop, along with it still being loud.I tried, I really did try to like this laptop, and tried to make it work, but after few days, I'm done. I give up. Save yourself the headache and don't even touch Lenovo.

  Brillant, super fast. Takes about 10 seconds to load up, even less to shut down. Speakers are ok and the screen could be a bit brighter but nothing to complain about. I recommend this laptop to anybody that wants a fast portable durable laptop 100%

  Really nice computer. Due to the limited number of output ports, I had to purchase a USB-C docking station for use at my home workstation. There is too  much latency to use a Logitech Bluetooth mouse. Either you have to push the bluetooth mouse left click button or you have to move the mouse and wait. The Logitech Unify mouse does not have this problem but it eats up a port.

  Have only had it for a month. So far, so good, knock on wood. Screen resolution is really crisp. Colors are very vivid. Fast response. Touchscreen works great. Everything works on command and as it is intended. It's a little too wide for my taste (13.3 in.), but I had no choice, given the specs. It's lightweight and thin, which is nice when I have to carry it around. Only complaint so far? Too expensive (and I bought it used, so a brand new unit would definitely be overpriced). Lacking a better alternative, I would probably buy this one again, given the choice in the current market.

  I was skeptical about purchasing this Lenovo Yoga 720-13ibk as it was listed about $400 LESS THAN similar laptops.  I took a chance and ordered it figuring I could return it through Amazon if I found it was not as advertised.  To my surprise it was more than I ever expected.  I already had the same computer that suddenly died due to a short on the motherboard.  I thought if nothing else I could swap the boards between computers.  Upon delivery I found this to be in excellent shape and swapping boards wasn't necessary.  This laptop was in better shape than the one I bought in 2017.  It makes me wonder why I paid $800 for a brand new one as this used computer was less than 1/3 the price of a new one.  Great buy and fast delivery.

  First of all I would like to mention this laptop comes with the lenovo Digital Pen included. I haven't tried using it yet, I will update this after. As of right now, I love this laptop! I think it's a great laptop, it does come with AMD Ryzen 5500U (Model 82HU0036US), I've used it for zoom meetings while running other apps in the background, for editing and illustrating using Adobe and I haven't experienced any lagging. The screen is extremely responsive when using it as a tablet, it runs as smoothly as it does when using it in laptop mode. Overall, I would recommend it. 10/10. If your think about buying it, BUY IT!! It's great!! Also, I bought it from IRONHILL TECH.

  PROS:+Right out of the box, it is light for a 14"" touchscreen panel ultrabook. At 3.3 lbs, it is easy to carry with you wherever you go.+For an ultrabook, this is a pretty powerful machine for ANY student. AMD's Ryzen 5 5500u processor outperforms its competitors while using significantly less power.+It runs at a maximum thermal design power (TDP) of 15W while sporting 6 cores and 12 threads.+WIFI 6 is NICE. Lots of coverage, bandwidth availability, and the signal from the Bluetooth 5.0 and the 2x2 802.11 ax WIFI 6 card. No drops and no lag which is the way it should be!+All of your favorite ports are still here. A USB type C for universal connectivity, 2 USB A 3.1 ports, an audio combo jack, a fingerprint reader, and an SD card reader. YAY an SD card reader for all the photographers and videographers!+The RAM is quick and spiffy for opening up applications. Running at DDR4 3200 MHz, this is a huge boost compared to the previous generation of laptops/ultrabooks.+The battery life is superb. For real-world use, this easily achieves around 10 hours of battery thanks to the low wattage of the 5th gen Ryzen AMD processors.+This charges via USB-C which is a nice feature since these chargers and cables are more efficient, affordable, and more available.+Surprisingly, this does well with light 1080p gaming. I was able to play popular titles at 60+ FPS+A huge plus for the included stylus pen. It's good enough to take notes and do light editing or drawing. For studying, this is great. you can rotate the screen and read through PDF files and annotate them as you go. Gamechanger.+The SSD is from WD which is in my top 3 for all-around hard drives. Specifically, it is running on a 256GB WDC PC SN530 with an endurance of 200-400 TBW. This is plenty and good enough for most users as you would need to fill up this hard drive (256GB) every day for 5 years in order to fail. This isn't going to happen so the boot drive is pretty reliable. Typical read and write speeds are 2400 MB/s and 950 MB/s, respectively. This is a mid-tier NVMe SSD, but it is still quick. Upgradeability is welcomed, and I would recommend anyone installing a 512GB or even 1TB NVMe SSD if considering this as a daily driver for content creation.+The price point is good for the tasteful specs on this ultrabook.OKAYS:>The trackpad is bearable. It isn't like the new Dell XPS trackpads or the quality of Apple's but it does the job without having to hate using it. For gaming, I would add a high DPI mouse. For editing, I would use the included stylus pen. The keyboard is above average. I am happy with it and can type all day with the keyboard in this Flex 5. My WPM (words per minute) typing count wasn't hindered in any way.CONS:-RAM is soldered which means you can't upgrade it. On the bright side, 16GB of DDR4 RAM at 3200MHz is more than plenty for the majority of consumers.-The screen has an IPS HD 45% NTSC display which is still manageable for editing videos and photos in Adobe CC. It is still great for amateurs and intermediate content creators and gets the job done.-The dimness of the screen tops out at 250 nits-The lack of a Thunderbolt 3/4 port-The storage capacity is minimal, but can easily be upgraded.Overall, I would highly recommend this for ALL students especially those getting into creating content. This is a great laptop to consider especially if you are on a budget and want a portable, reliable, and durable touchscreen ultrabook.

  I have been a fan of Lenovo laptops for a while now.  They are not loaded with too many garbage apps and they are usually well-built, fast, and designed well.  This 2-in-1 is no different.  Here are some of the highlights:- The pen and touchscreen.  If you've never had a laptop that had a touchscreen that was compatible with active stylus pens (vs passive), it's a great experience.  The best place to get acquainted with the pen and its features is by viewing the pen settings in Windows so you can control what the two buttons on the pen will do, and to practice in Microsoft Whiteboard, a link to which is in the Windows taskbar.  You can draw using a variety of pens or even have your handwriting converted to text automatically.  It does an amazing job converting my horrible penmanship into text.  You can hold down one of the buttons on the pen and swipe around to erase easily.  It even responds to pressure so the harder you press, the thicker the line that is drawn.  The pen can be used in most apps and act just like a mouse.  There is no annoying plastic disc on the stylus like passive pens have... it feels much more like working with a real pen.- Windows 10 in tablet mode.  When you flip the screen around and hold it like a tablet, Windows goes into tablet mode automatically and you don't have to worry about touching the keys or touchpad underneath because they are automatically turned off.  No matter which direction you hold the screen, the image flips so you are always viewing Windows right side up, just like your phone.- The fingerprint reader.  You can sign in to Windows in a split second just by touching the fingerprint reader after it is set up during Windows Setup.  There is almost no delay when reading your fingerprint.- A built-in webcam shutter helps you maintain privacy, just in case an app gains access to your camera unknowingly.- Front-facing speakers help make the laptop sound better than others that have sound coming out of the bottom.  The speakers are on both sides of the keyboard, so when in tablet mode, the sound will be underneath.- Speed.  This laptop doesn't leave you hanging.  It's fast.  I attached the speed test results for the hard drive after applying all Windows updates.  Since hard drive speed is often the thing that can slow down a new computer the most these days, it's important that this laptop has the hard drive speeds that it does.  Write speeds could be a little better but trust me, it's plenty fast.  I took the speed test in CrystalDiskMark 64-bit and it was performed while the computer was plugged in since you get the best performance.  I wanted to demonstrate the maximum power of the laptop.  But even when it is running on battery, you won't notice too much of a difference unless you were performing really resource-intensive work.- Battery life is good.  It all depends on what mode you are in, what your battery settings are set to (performance vs battery conservation), etc so if I were to tell you it typically lasts 12 hours, it wouldn't tell you much.- The laptop is pretty light for having a keyboard attached and things like an HDMI port and card reader.If you are looking for a great laptop that can double as a tablet that is reasonably priced, you can't go wrong with this one.

  I bought this product in December 2020 and used it three times in January before it stopped booting up.  I tried all the recovery options and nothing worked. I contacted the seller on January 31st, 2021 and he replied on February 01st 2021 telling me that it could be a manufacture's defect, i should check Lenovo support or return the item. I tried Lenovo support and was told the board was defective. I then contacted the seller to retun, he then tells me that the last day to return was January 31st. The laptop says there is 1 year warranty but the seller refuses to accept the return even though i contacted him as soon as the problem arose.  I paid $749.00 and have a defective, non working item.

  Hey guys, my name's Please Read, but you can call me PR. Listen, hear me out, I know that you're busy or have a short attention span, but it'll be worth it to read this WHOLE review. I'm gonna be critical about this, because I have a couple of things I love and absolutely hate about this product. So, stick around, and maybe I'll make you spend (or save) about $700. But seriously, please read till the end.A bit about me, I‚Äôm a college student and I was looking for a new laptop cause my old one was garbage and was terrible for work.Before I start, I'm going to explain my scoring system. The system will be based on a x/8 point system, in which I will convert to a x/5 stars (since I am only allowed to go up to 5 stars).So, let‚Äôs begin this review!Specifications: 3/3CPU: 1-It‚Äôs a Core i5-10210U, which isn‚Äôt that bad for a laptop like this. It can run numerous tabs and applications without problems and is enough to play non-GPU intensive games at 60FPS on medium ‚Äì high settings.RAM: 1-8 GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to keep things running on your laptop without making it want to poop itself. It can run numerous tabs and applications without problems.Storage: 1It‚Äôs a 256 GB Solid State Drive (SSD). Loads things faster than I can blink, so it‚Äôs great when I have to open a lot of things for research, play, etc.Components: 3/5Audio: 1-The audio is absolutely amazing. It‚Äôs crisp, clear, and you don‚Äôt need to buy a speaker to hear the thing on maximum volume. You can hear the bass clearly too, so it‚Äôs awesome for watching movies, listening to music, lectures, etc.Screen: 1-This laptop has absolutely great screen resolution that tops other 17-inch laptops out there.‚ÄúBut PR,‚Äù I hear you ask. ‚ÄúWhy is that? Don‚Äôt all 17-inch laptops have good resolu-‚ÄúShhh, it‚Äôs okay, let me explain.This laptop is 1920 x 1080 resolution, which basically means it has more pixels on the screen so you‚Äôll get finer detail on your screen. This is unheard of, since most of the 17-inch laptop products on here and everywhere else have resolutions of only 1600 x 900.This. Is. Madness.Having a 1600 x 900 screen feels like you‚Äôre watching something on 720p. You can count the damn pixels, and it‚Äôs just ugly. This laptop right here, the one you‚Äôre looking to buy, is 1920 x 1080 resolution. It is one of the VERY FEW 17-inch laptops out there with GOOD screen resolution. That means no ugly pixel problems like the other laptops. So, you won‚Äôt have that problem. No pixel counting, just beautiful image and video.Keyboard and trackpad: 1-Keyboard and trackpad feel great. Since this laptop is bigger, it will take some time to get used to typing. But once you get a hang of it, you‚Äôll be typing like a mad man. It‚Äôs comfortable to type and do work on.Camera: 0-Like all laptops that are made for work, I have yet to find one that has a good camera. I doubt that I ever will‚Ä¶ But since this component is part of the laptop, I will still have review it.Bottom line, the camera sucks. Very grainy even in good lighting, so don‚Äôt count on taking nice pics with this.Battery: 0-Terrible battery life. Laptop says 6 hours when fully charged. Then I just use Word and Powerpoint, but 15 minutes later it turns to 3 hours. But lives for another hour or two with power saver on, but I need to plug in after 4 hours, so still terrible when on the go. Recommend you always plug it in‚Ä¶ SPEAKING OF ALWAYS KEEPING IT PLUGGED IN.OH MY GOODNESS... WHERE DID ALL MY WORK GO!?: -2-I don‚Äôt know where to begin. I‚Äôm busy working on multiple projects and I have all these notes that I have written down that I‚Äôve spent days writing. All this time I‚Äôve had my laptop plugged in. But one day I had it unplugged. The laptop said that it had a 6 hour‚Äôs before it runs out. I‚Äôm sitting there tapping away for 3 hours, and boom, Laptop shuts down. There was no indicator that the battery was getting low.I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh what- ah, the battery died.‚ÄùSo, I go plug it in, and leave it for a couple of minutes to charge it up. I come back and press the power button. The Lenovo logo pops up.And then it doesn‚Äôt start up.At this point, I‚Äôm confused. I do it again, and again. But the laptop just doesn‚Äôt want to go to the home screen.So, there I am, looking throughout the internet to try and figure out what the hell is going on. Turns out, Lenovo has a big problem when starting up. And when it FINALLY goes to the auto-repair screen to REINSTALL WINDOWS 10, even the AUTO-REINSTALL HAS A PROBLEM.There were two major problems here, the boot up issue and the windows 10 reinstallation issue. Amazon probably won‚Äôt let me post the links, so I‚Äôll just leave it at that. Good luck finding a solution yourself. But let me tell you, it‚Äôll make you feel like a computer engineer or software designer or something.So, the entire process took me 2 hours to fix and I‚Äôm freaking out because I didn‚Äôt have time to get a new laptop because I‚Äôm a busy college student in med field.Finally, the problem is fixed. And I think to myself, ‚ÄúThat took forever‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt have more time to write notes, but I should at least look at them before I go to sle-‚ÄúAnd all my notes are gone. All. My. Notes. Are. GONE. All my hard work for the past couple of days have been deleted. I have to start all over, and I didn‚Äôt get any sleep that night.Next time, I saved all my work onto a different hard drive, and I let my laptop die. Same problem.So if you get this laptop... Always, ALWAYS keep this laptop plugged in, or pay the price like I did.(TLDR I guess) Conclusion:-Specs are good-Components are alright-Lenovo computers frequently have this problem, and I should‚Äôve done a little more research before I bought this product.Am I happy with this product? Kind of, the initial experience wasn‚Äôt super great. It makes it unreliable, since you can‚Äôt take it with you on the go because it just poops on itself and erases everything once it runs out of battery.If you stay at home a lot, or if you know places where there are outlets, then this computer is for you. If not, then look at my recommendations at the end of this review.Final score (Rounding up)Specifications: 3/3Components: 3/5Deleting All My Files Always When it Runs out of Battery: -3 StarsTotal: 3 / 8 points.Conversion to 5 Star System = 2 / 5 StarsRecommendationsASUS VivoBook 17.3"" FHD (1920 x1080) Display Laptop PC, AMD Ryzen 7 3700U Processor, 12GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD, Bluetooth, Webcam, HDMI, WiFi, AMD Radeon RX Vega 10 Graphics, Windows 10 HomeASUS VivoBook 17 17.3"" FHD Laptop Computer, Quad-Core AMD Ryzen 7 3700U (Beats i7-8550U), 20GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, 802.11ac WiFi, Type-C, Silver, Windows 10.

  I am very happy with my purchase.  The screen is large with nice clarity.  The keyboard easy to use.  I can type much faster on it than my last laptop.  VERY lightweight.  Decent speed for the price.  I had a professional-grade laptop before - but it cost almost twice as much.  So for the price, this computer exceeded my expectations.  I really have no complaints overall.  In another review - the person rated it negatively because his battery died allegedly without warning.  I don't know how that happened because my Lenovo BOTH shows the percentage of battery life left AND gives me several on-screen warnings when my battery is low.  Soooo..... I think his laptop running out of battery and him losing his work was his fault - not his Lenovo's.FYI - I use this laptop to stream TV/movies; surf the internet; and write documents.  I do not game with it or use it for business or higher functions like video making etc., so I am not including advanced operations in this review.  This review is strictly for personal usage.  And if the life of this computer ends up being good - I would definitely buy another.

  I have a Lenovo ideapad 130-15ast that I  bought at target a couple yrs ago.  I had booted off a USB Flash Drive running WinPEx64 to prepare to make an image back up the O.S.  Note: the C: (the O.S. drive) was not even in use, since I had booted off the Flash USB drive.  I accidentally pulled the USB out (I thought the PC was off, but the screen saver had turns off the screen).  ""Oh well"" I thought, if anything would be damaged, it would be the Flash drive and I have lots of those.  I'll just run  shutdown -s -t 0from the command prompt like I always do to shut down.Well, wouldn't you know it, I go to boot the O.S. and it won't boot!!!  The Lenovo recovery failed as well.  I called Lenovo, and they tried the recovery w/ me again, but it was futile.  I had to go to another computer and download a big file(s) from Lenovo, and copy it all to another flash drive, to make a bootable flash drive that had the Windows Install files as well.Unlike the other reviewer, once I saw my PC was unbootable, I booted off my WinPEx64 flash, was able to access the C: drive and copy my files off the C: and over to my flash drive and save them.  I then put the 2nd usb flash drive in and it reinstalled the Lenovo version of windows.I though my problem was ""one off"".  But now, I saw this other review, so I'm taking the time to create a review so people know this problem (OS won't boot, and can't be repaired) happened on another Lenovo as well.  I ranked this review as a neutral 3 stars so as not to change the rating on this product.So, the lesson w/ Lenovo's:(1) Make and Image Backup of the O.S. drive/partition so when the O.S. drive/partition becomes corrupted, you can restore and get back to work(2) Put a SDHD card in the media reader slot and use the ""Windows Backup"" to continually backup ""my documents"" (I assume that's where you store your files) to the SDHD card.  That way, you always have 2 copies of your data.(3) When done working for the day, stick a USB flash drive in, and make a 2nd copy of ""My Documents"" so there's no way that Lenovo can fluck you over and loose your data.

  Laptop would not work on A/C power batteries self diagnose was fine. A/C power pack was fine, and the Built in computer Icon showed it was charging, but never charged. I contacted Amazon and the seller and no issues they told me to return for a refund or exchange for another unit you cannot ask for better service.On battery power the Laptop checked all the boxes. Lightweight, fast response, and all the features I wanted. Very nice backlit keyboard. The whole laptop coverts to a Tablet. My only disappointment was it would not charge.  I gave it four stars if it charged I would give it five. I would still recommend the Lenovo Yoga C7 as the seller and  Amazon stood by the customer.

  It's taking some time getting use to it, since I had a15.6"".  I'm use to having the numbers on the right side of keyboard, big adjustment. Dislike the type c charging cable since it has a round point power port. Have no use for the HDMI port.  Wish it had a Ethernet port instead. Only 2 USB ports, I bet the cable mfg love it selling adapters and docking ports, and adapters. I don't use it for games, and haven't tried touch screen. Over all I like the unit beats the old HHD. Like the flexibility of it make it a tablet. So many things I wish to try.

All computers come on when you press the power button  but this is not coming on . I have paid $529.99 for a brand new i really dont know what to call this because I was desperate for a lap top I need to use this but it just not coming on so i feel i have paid for something that is completely useless and the return date and tech support date has passed. Amazon please refund me my money because i am unable to use this lenovo computer that is just not working and on top of this i live in trinidad and tobago and it would cost me more to return this to you. Somebody please help me. I only receive this on the 19th April because i had it sent to an American address and only receive it on the 19th april, 2018. I am so angry that i could bawl everyday over this.

  Why did I buy this?I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn‚Äôt really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years.What I considered / compared it too?GPU ‚Äì GTX 1650 ‚Äì this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search.Processor ‚Äì 9th gen i5 ‚Äì I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that‚Äôs what I really valued most.NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo‚Äôs website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that‚Äôs why I decided against that route.NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn‚Äôt look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more.NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site.Monitor refresh ‚Äì 60Hz ‚Äì this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger on the extra costs.RAM ‚Äì 8GB ‚Äì documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost.NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn‚Äôt concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect.512gig SSD ‚Äì I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today‚Äôs modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5‚Äù bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won‚Äôt cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too.The Look ‚Äì As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a ‚Äúgaming‚Äù laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don‚Äôt need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers.Keyboard backlight ‚Äì has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision.Heat ‚Äì this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn‚Äôt appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch.Battery life ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can‚Äôt plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours.Bloat ‚Äì amazingly it didn‚Äôt come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that‚Äôs about it.What games do I play on it?No Man‚Äôs Sky Beyond ‚Äì Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at allWoW ‚Äì Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise)Overwatch ‚Äì Ultra Settings with no issuesAs I play and test more games ill update this‚Ä¶..9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs.11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings.12/10/20 EDIT - Cyberpunk 2077 - played on Medium in game settings with no issues at all. prob could have bumped it up a setting.What about the backlight/bleeding reports?Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don‚Äôt.  I get that everyone has defects and a % of DOA product.  Everyone‚Äôs mileage will differ on this I guess.

  Unboxed earlier today and about 3 hours into use the backlight suddenly went out and unable to turn back on.

  Because this computer, was seriously great while I had it up and operational. I thought it was my dream laptop like the other users have said. Unfortunately, barely a week into use, my laptop froze up on me while I was browsing the internet, I forced shut it down, and it never turned back on. Did every fix in the book for hours on end but nothing worked.Now, I have to return it. I'm very disappointed, I've never had a laptop cut out on me so fast in all the years I've had laptops.

  First off, performance on this laptop is great. The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C.I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the ""gamer"" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice.The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers.Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others.

  Overall decent laptop for the $700 range, you get what you paid for.Battery life is ok if you put everything to lowest. The single channel RAM is a turn off, if this was a double RAM channel then it would be a 5/5.

  This machine as it comes to you is not a bad unit. It functions properly and works well. My pros with this machine is that it is very expansive. I was able to add a second hard drive to this machine (internally) and the primary hard drive was upgraded to a faster and larger SSD drive. I also pushed the memory to the max (2 slots). That and then an upgrade to Windows 10 pro and the machine is actually very very useful. My cons with this machine are really only that there are not enough USB ports. 2 more would be fine, 4 more would be amazing. I would rather have another 3.0 USB instead of a USB C port. My biggest pro with this machine is there is NO ETHERNET port. I should have done more research before I bought this. It would have changed my mind I think.. Having an Ethernet port is a big deal for me.  Overall, if you don't need the Ethernet and the USB ports are enough for you, this is a good machine and will last a long time.

  Hi All,So I purchased this laptop with the hope of replacing my almost 10 year old dell xps L501x.I've been using this system for around two months now, here are my views:The system is quite capable of demanding workloads( Matlab/Simulink etc). The catch : the fans (there are two of them at the bottom) make quite a racket on full throttle, especially if you change the thermal management to performance.If the setting is left to intelligent you can hear the fan roaring every now and then. Having said that, I've used the laptop on my lap and never felt the heat for normal workloads.The laptop comes with 8gb ram @2400mhz. There is only one ram slot. However, the configuration is interesting: 4gb ram is soldered onto the motherboard and the remaining 4 gb is provided by the ramstick. Keep in mind that the vega graphics will consume 2gb of the 8gb, you'll be left with only six.The good news is that the ram is upgradable. I swapped in a 16gb stick, so now I have 4+16=20Gb of ram, 18 of which is usable. I would highly suggest upgrading the ram as it makes a lot of difference.The stock ssd is 256gb is good for regular use. I swapped in a 1tb NVMe m2 from crucial which sorts my data needs.Don't expect the battery to last as long as mentioned, especially under stress. I got about 3 hours. If you set the laptop to cool & quiet in lenovo vantage, and best battery life under windows power options then it's possible to get around 5-6 hours, although you're taking quite a performance hit.I like that the laptop came with a stylus. What I didn't like is that the stylus holder uses one USB port and blocks the use of the other ports. I purchased an adhesive based pen holder and stuck it onto the back cover.Another peeve I had was with the power brick. It's not very bulky but it directly connects to the wall socket without any cord. If you are using a slim power strip, you'll definitely run into space constraints. Again this can be rectified with the purchase of a two prong extension cord.The build quality is quite good. It feels solid with no creaks. I like the keyboard. The speakers are downward facing, however, this helps in tent and tablet mode as they end up facing you.I hate that the keyboard backlight doesn't dim automatically - it did on the xps. You have three settings: Low, High, Off with you can toggle with the fn+spacebar keys.I'd suggest getting a screen protector (a matte one), the glossy screen which is beautiful to watch movies on, is a fingerprint magnet and is quite reflective.Something I'd like to highlight is the usb c port. It does not support power delivery or video ports. It's good only for data transfers and Ethernet ports. Please be careful while purchasing expensive hubs as even the one lenovo recommends comes with an hdmi port that will not work. Please google for more on this issue. For those that are interested in using this laptop for a multi display setup, I'd suggest using the onboard hdmi port and getting a usb to vga/hdmi display adapter.Some issues that I've faced:1. High cpu usage cause by Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation (check service in task manager)- This was a strange issue. I had really high cpu usage spikes (noticeable by the roaring fan) at idle.  The task mentioned above used to consume 30to 80% of the cpu.I tried everything from driver swapping, disabling  sound enhancements, hardware acceleration etc.The solution was to uninstall Skype!!!! Everything is normal since.2. WiFi dropping: Another persistent issue that plagued me was frequent wifi dropping. Apparently this issue is caused by faulty drivers for the Realtek 8822E wifi chip. All users with laptops containing this card have faced this issue, so I can't fault lenovo.I've tried playing around with the drivers and various settings. Some users have swapped the wifi chip for an intel one - it will cost around 10 to 20 usd. The best results I achieved are with the 2023.xxx driver. Do not update to the 2024.xxx version!!! Hopefully Realtek rectifies this issue with new drivers. You can also change the chip altogether.For those looking for a more oomph, lenovo has practically the same laptop with a ryzen 7 3700U. It might be worth looking into. Keep in my that you don't get a free stylus with that.Hope you like this review. Have fun with this laptop.----------------Update on 5th SeptemberHere is an update on my experience so far.Keep in mind that the links shared are of items purchased in June/July, you might get better/cheaper products now.I finally grew weary of the wifi drops and the workarounds. I swapped in an Intel 9260 chip. No problems since then. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079QJQF4Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)Here's the upgraded ram and NVMe SSD that I swapped in:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019FRBHZ0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J2Q4SWZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The alternate pen holder:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H8DYNGF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The Power brick extension cord:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0784JNFFJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1If you guys are looking for a usb c NVMe SSD reader for the cloning process, this is the one I used:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MNFH1PX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1For those wanting to hook this laptop up to more than 1 screen, you can have a look at this:https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Universal-Docking-Station-Ethernet/dp/B00ECDM78E/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=plugable+hub&qid=1567693621&s=hi&sr=1-1-catcorrIt has usb 3.0, usb 2.0, ethernet, HDMI, DVI, (DVI to VGA converter included), mic, and headphones ports.The drivers are really iffy with some of the things on this laptop esp the display if you have them updated with AMDs most recent.  Right now the stable optional driver that I'm using is 19.6.2. AMDs optional drivers are quite buggy (BSODs etc). I'd suggest sticking to the stable ones only.For those suffering from the yellow tint on the screen. It's a software/driver issue. Update to one of the stable drivers and make sure lenovo eyecare and windows night light are both off.for those having a laggy/erratic mouse/keyboard issue, it's allegedly an audio driver issue. Download the latest Synaptics connexant audio drivers online and select that as the target folder for device manager to update the Synaptics audio device (under sound). Some users have found success with this method.-Keith

  This laptop performs great but is initially starved for RAM if you plan on running any virts or similarly intensive workload. The RAM is upgrade-able but only has 1 upgrade-able slot (4GB is soldered onto motherboard for other slot, probably due to GPU?). I attached pictures to prove that the Lenovo representatives are flat out lying to customers about this.Not sure why they are lying about it repeatedly, maybe to make you buy a more expensive model. Either way this works great once you add a 16GB stick (you can get one for around $70 on Amazon).

  This laptop has amazingly good build quality, and is very snappy to use. The achiles heel is that it only has 6 GB of RAM available to the OS, since it is capped at 8 GB non upgradeable, and 2 GB are dedicated to the integrated graphics. 8 GB would be OK if fully usable, but 6 GB is getting a bit tight these days due to the horrible new trend of desktop apps written in Javascript.Apart from 8 GB instead of 16 GB RAM, this laptop is amazing, and I hope that Lenovo will continue to consider the AMD Ryzen processors instead of Intel processors for future laptops in this price range. The latest-gen Ryzen has excellent multicore performance. AMD's integrated graphics are also surprisingly good, especially considering that you get it for free from the processor. This computer should be able to run basically any AAA game released in 2013ish or before at high settings despite being an ultralight notebook with no dedicated graphics card. It can also run relatively less demanding modern games like Overwatch or Fortnite at high settings well.The SSD could maybe be a bit bigger in this age of cheap 3DNAND SSD's, but it is very fast. The computer boots up instantly and has very little post-startup lag, making the fingerprint reader very nice to have as login time would be the time bottleneck in getting started otherwise.The screen is great, both as an HD screen and as a touchscreen. It is larger than any ipad and gives an amazing touch experience. I expected it to be a bit bulky, but the laptop has an evenly distributed weight and balances well despite its size, so the tablet + pen experience is great. Used the pen to try writing and solving some physics equations with subscripts and superscripts, and it worked great, better than my old early-gen surface.At this price level, this is the best offering out there imho for a 2 in 1 laptop. A microsoft surface tablet with similar performance would cost you twice as much.EDIT: After learning that the RAM is in fact upgradeable, I increased my review to a 5. I ended up installing a 16 GB ram stick to increase the RAM to 20 GB (18 GB usable with 2 going to the GPU), and a 1 TB SSD stick from Sabrent:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071KP8CGJhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LGF54XR/This laptop is a pleasure to open up & work with. Replacing the RAM and SSD was a very straightforward operation. Might also add a new networking card as well. The current networking card works great on a strong wifi network, but frequently drops connectivity when the signal is weaker.

  Just writing a quick review for anyone wanting to put Linux on this. I didn't find anything online about this model as to compatibility and took a chance when buying it. I'm using Ubuntu 19.04 and 99% of things seems to work out of the box. The network chip is a RTL8822BE, which seems to be both wifi and bluetooth. Both worked without any tinkering. The touchscreen works as well, including screen rotation and the included stylus. Tested with Gimp. All keyboard shortcuts seem to work, including the backlight. Microphone and camera work. The only thing I haven't gotten to work is the fingerprint reader. I haven't really played with it much though. It looks like it might be combined with the TPM, as I don't see a device for it.To boot off USB, I had to press that Nova button thing to get into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot. F12 then brings up the boot menu. Fairly easy once I found something small enough to hit the button. Had to use a sewing needle.So far, decent laptop. Looks pretty.

  I've been a loyal Dell customer for years, so when my last laptop died, I was wary about straying from what I know. After much research, I decided to go with Lenovo, and am thrilled that I did! Everything about this laptop is great - the display, the feel of it, the keyboard, the responsiveness of the touch screen, the flip mode. I would definitely recommend a Lenovo Flex to anyone in the market for a brand new laptop. No fan noise at all, accurate fingerprint sensor, the mouse actually clicks and right-clicks properly. Best part - how affordable it is!

  This computer is awful. I can‚Äôt even believe how slow it is. Working in excel, click on something to copy, then click to paste...then I‚Äôm waiting 15-25 seconds for anything to happen. It takes forever to get the simplest thing done. I‚Äôd throw it out the window if it wasn‚Äôt so expensive and I didn‚Äôt desperately need it to work from home.

  The machine is beautiful, works fast with the SSD and the touch screen is great.One problem which I didn't figure it out while buying was the size of the SSD, I should have bought 512GB like the previous machine we had. Well, the cloud might solve this issue.Second, There was a mismatch between two places in amazon page about the weight of the computer, I found it out after I got it and it was heavier than I expected. One place it was written 3.50 lbs and in the second one: 4.96 lbsStill - A great computer and I am very happy I got it.

  I'm much older than the average user, so my complaints may seem quaint. The included stand is useless to me as the computer keeps falling over. I lay it on its side. How much more expensive would one or two more USB ports be? I never seem to have enough. Of course, I can use extensions, but I wish I had a few more plug-ins. Mouse and CD Player Take up two ports. Also, it would be beneficial if ad included cable info for monitors. I had to buy a new cable before I could set up the computer as my monitor is six or seven years old. These are minor complaints. So far (about 2 weeks) I am completely satisfied with this computer.

  Item description here states USB-C port on this computer. There is NOT a USB-C port on this computer. Sort of unfortunate, but I suppose you can also see there is no port in the item's pictures provided by the seller. There is an SD Card reader though.Ram provided is @ 3200 / 4 gig module.Upgraded to 2400 / 16 gig for a total of 20GB RAM. Still performs quick.Otherwise, as expected, laptop seems pretty good. Upgraded hard drive and RAM however to do more - 4700u is awesome for a laptop. Handled Overwatch at 60fps (mind you it uses dynamic resolution to keep fps @ 60.) Blender rendered out things at a pretty great speed (considering 15w cpu!). Will try something like ARK soon - the 3700u was playable with ARK, this should be interesting to see on the 4700u. (Tested @ 1920x1080)Full size keyboard is a plus (new for me at least). Laptop auto powers on when lid is opened, that needs to be changed I think.For Office / Business use: This could handle most any office program (Office 365, etc.), your large crazy PDF's, and great battery life to boot. Webcam + integrated microphone for meetings. One HDMI out for another screen, but thats it.  Dont expect to much magic as far as hooking up multiple monitors, I would suggest looking into a 4K screen and using software to divide it into 4 screens.

  The Lenovo Ideapad 3 Ryzen 7 4700U is a great laptop. You'll have to get an external webcam unit or use your smartphone). Short Story...I like this laptop and I am glad that I made this purchase. Although you are giving up in a few areas. Webcam quality (terrible), no keyboard back-light and display is not color accurate (designed for privacy so still good). despite these trade-offs.  I have had this for a week and I am enjoying it.--- Long Story -Reason for purchase and product review Working in data analytics I needed something that could meet the numbers crunching challenge and multi-tasking on a budget and this will do. It was on sale and the price was just right.--- Basic factsWith the 8 core multi thread CPU you will find that this laptop will perform very well in day to day use. In reviewing the ports on the left side (to be clear) there is the power input, HDMI, 2 ports that are USB 3's and a USB 2. The right side has the SD card, audio and a pin hole, which is important (It allows you to enter Bios mode when gently pressing it with a needle at the time of each power up, no need to use the power button for this procedure).It has Windows 10 home edition installed. I installed Ubuntu Mate 20.0. Funny thing is that at the time of this purchase no graphic drivers were available in the install, because the laptop was so new to the market!  :-)  I had to manually install the drivers provided by AMD for Linux Ubuntu 20.0. This approach will not be necessary within a short time as developers catch up and add this driver. The Linux OS was super fast and so was Windows (no lag in either) I also worked with Dex for my Samsung S9+ and the connection, responsiveness and appearance is great. The phone even charges a little, though if you use the Dex for too much activity the load may work against you and the phone could start losing in the battery level.--- Benchmarks.I used the Performance Test 10 software and this laptop came in at the 57th percentile in overall performance, that is pretty good. Ranks up there with the Intel Core i7-8700 @ 3.7Ghz with only 6 cpu's. Laptops with the intel chip generally cost twice as much and are usually throttled.Gaming is so and so. I'm not a gamer, but I know the system requirements for a good gaming experience and this falls way short of that level of performance. It is good enough for moderate gaming. This laptop was designed for multi-tasking and hard number crunching. This means you can open a lot of applications,  crunching large data sets and watch Youtube videos and it will work just fine.  Graphic designing should be good as well.--- AppearanceThis came in Abyss Blue. A beautiful dark bluish sheet metal appearance that feels good in the hands. It has a beautiful sleek appearance. The screen seems rigid. There is a keyboard and keypad (which is really nice) along with a mouse pad. The keyboard feels good to work with and the mouse pad behaved perfectly. No keyboard back lighting, which is a sacrifice I can make. I like the layout.--- DisplayThe screen is nice although it is true, when it is said that you give up on color reproduction. I've connected an external monitor and the difference can be readily noticed. It is still good for everyday use indoors, just don't take it outside into the sunlight. It was designed for privacy and so peripheral viewing is limited. If I want color accuracy then that is when the external monitor comes in handy.There is a webcam, BUT...It is the worst I have ever seen. Either get an external webcam or use your smartphone as an external webcam. There is an app that you can install to make this happen.--- InternalsThe 500 M.2 Nvme is good enough to do the job (of course) way superior To HDD or other (older) non-Nvme drives at this time.I did a Crucial System Scan and found that this system configuratoin will accept up to 16gb of RAM.16GB 260-Pin DDR4 SO-DIMM DDR4 2666 (PC4 21300). Costs around $60+ at the time of writing. The reviews indicate that the firmware will only recognize 2666 no use in going higher (like 3200). It will just default to 2666.I'm ordering that today. This will really amp up the performance. from 8Gb to 20gb.--UPDATE: I upgraded the RAM and the system recognized it. There is a slight improvement in performance (faster than before - It was already fast to begin with so...WOW!!).--NOTE: There is a metal plate that goes over the removable RAM. Be very careful removing this and placing it back on. I like how the RAM clips on very good.It is easy to access the internals in my opinion (I watched a Youtube and accessed this unit 2 times).  Others that reviewed the unit say you can install a second SSD drive. First... On this model you cannot, because the battery takes up the area where the drive would go. Second...The tiny ribbon to connect the SATA drive is missing, though I found the connector to the mother board and perhaps you could switch out the battery for a smaller form factor from a similar model reviewed (Hopefully Lenovo will give feedback to this and provide the part number). Third...There is no drive housing to anchor the drive to the unit (you would have to buy it online or cannibalize it from another unit), again, Lenovo, Hope your reading this and can provide a part number for both the ribbon and housing.  But I am good with what I have and if I want, I can upgrade to a 1tb from the 500gig.So far the laptop is Not running hot. I've installed the Rainmeter app and downloaded some system performance widgets that observe all key areas of performance. Overall performance is great.Battery life is okay. I have yet to reach a point when the unit needs to be plugged in. Though in both Linux and Windows the average amount of time to discharge is over 6 and a half hours. NOTE: The processor is really good about saving power and reviewers speak really well about the battery life going much further than that. There is an option between performance and power savings. Since I'm used to having it plugged in, I prefer performance.That's all. I Hope this helps in your buying decision.Enjoy the hunt for your next laptop.  :-)

  Had this product for a few days and am highly satisfied. I was very skeptical due to the VERY mixed reviews, and on top of that I've never owned a Lenovo product. Saying that, I was EXTREMELY impressed with the build quality of the laptop. It was very sturdy, and doesn't feel at all cheap. It feels like an ultrabook. Performance was very good. The only game I've really tried so far has been Borderlands 2, which I could play on high graphic settings at a perfectly playable fps @ 1080p. Now the most common complaint I've seen across the board was the crappy screen. I will admit, the colors seem very washed out. However, if you go into the Intel graphics properties you can adjust the color saturation. If you bump up the color saturation and slightly bring the gamma down, the colors will pop ALOT more. I'm not saying it makes the display absolutely gorgeous, but it improves it a lot. The matte finish on the display makes it very good for gaming and for any extended periods of time viewing it. My only real complaint is that the spacebar isn't very sensitive. You will find yourself typing and looking up noticing that you didn't type a space and your words run together. Not a huge deal, you just have to make sure you firmly touch the spacebar, For the price, this is probably your best choice for very portable gaming and really anything if your on a budget. The i7 is only a dual core but gets the job done, and the radeon r9 graphics are underrated, They have exceeded my expectations! Overall, great value.************UPDATE****************A year later and this laptop is still my daily driver, when away from my desktop. The battery has completely went to crap, and I have a replacement on the way from Lenovo ($75). This went out quicker than expected, but it did have heavy use (I am a student). The hard drive got to the point to where it was unbearably slow. I recently replaced it with a 240gb SSD and I cannot even begin to tell you how much life it breathed into the system. I know how nice having an SSD is as I have one in my desktop, but I never realized quite how slow of a hard drive this laptop had until I put in an SSD. Do yourself a favor and spend a little money on a solid state. It will really help fully unlock some of the power this laptop feels like it's lacking.Pros-Awesome exterior quality with fancy, yet subtle looksLots of power for the price (does well in games and any other tasks)1080p screen resolution3 USB ports, including one specifically made for phone charging14in in my opinion is the perfect sizeCons-Washed out screen (fixable)No disc driveSpacebar doesn't work to well (not a huge deal)

  I bought this laptop refurbished for 400$, and for that price it's really good.Battery last 3+ hours with normal use, keyboard it's fine but it's not backlight, screen it's 1080p with good quality (not amazing, just good), the speakers do a really good job and the R9 M275x it's good enough to run Esports games (Dota, League of Legends, Counter Strike Global Offensive) very good, between 30-40 fps in mid-high settings at 1080p, of course if you low the resolution to 720p you'll reach 60 fps.I've tested:PES 2017 : 900p - Max settings with mods - 60fpsDark Souls II Scholar of the first sin:  720p - max settings - 60fps (constant)CS:GO : 720p - max settings (2xMSAA) - 70/80fpsSome cons are that for the size it's a little bit heavy and you're only be able to play with the dedicated gpu with the charger connected (but I think it's most a windows problem that the laptop itself). All the other problems written in the other reviews did not happened to me.Overall, it's a really good laptop even today, but just if you buy it for 400$ or less.For 800$ I'll definitely recommend this one: https://www.amazon.com/Pavilion-Notebook-i5-6300HQ-Affordable-Computer/dp/B01HSXL5CI/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1478694551&sr=1-4&keywords=HP+Pavilion+15+Gaming+NotebookIt have a SSD + HDD, 4 core processor and a GTX 960m, which it's WAY better.

  Like others have mentioned, the track pad is prone to failure. I'm at my wits end with it and it nearly cost me my grades in a few of my college classes. I will have to replace this laptop before Fall quarter comes around and I've had it less than a year.Update July 5th: My wifi capabilities is dying on this laptop. Checked for viruses, nothing wrong. Restarted, still having issues. My wifi is working perfectly fine (I'm watching Netflix on my Roku while I write this review and wait for the wifi to work again on my laptop) and the fault is with the laptop. I feel stuck. Summer quarter started today and I cannot afford to be without a laptop, but I can't afford a new one either. This is by far the worst laptop I've ever owned. At least I got multiple years out of all my others, this one didn't even last one!

  So far I'm fairly happy with this laptop.  I had zero problem getting things set up, and for being a 44 year old mom who isn't very tech savvy, that's saying something.  I mostly use the internet and sometimes let my youngest daughter play Minecraft or other games on my computer.  Sometimes my older kids will use my computer instead of theirs for homework assignments.  I find Windows 8 cumbersome, but I'm not used to it yet.  The *only* real problem I have is that the colors are extremely washed out and drab.  When I went out looking for more technical reviews, this seems to be a common complaint about this laptop.  Considering that most of what I do is look at text and pictures, this may be a deal breaker and I may wind up returning it for that reason only.  I have attached a picture to show the difference between my old desktop and this laptop.  My brightness is up all the way, and I haven't found another setting to change the contrast or any other parameters that might help. I will probably call their support number and see if I'm missing something.

  Excellent multimedia laptop. Runs very cool although as other have stated colors do not ""pop"", detail is HD quality. Gaming is good depending on how demanding titles are. Skyrim, Minecraft etc... all run smoothly and glitch free, Wow and many newer more demanding games will cause slower frame rates and buyer will probably not be happy.

  ¬†TL;DR: UPDATED FROM 3 TO 1 BECAUSE IT STILL SAYS IPS SCREEN IN THE DESCRIPTION, IT'S NOT IPS, ITS TN.TL;DR: The screen is bad, video is from this LENOVO, image is from my MSI, TN display vs IPS display.I don't have much to say actually, as I'm about to return this product, I bought it because of the amazing Ryzen 7, the 16GB of RAM and the 512 SSD all in less than 4 pounds, but the catch is in the screen, I thought it was an IPS display as it is stated in the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION section, turns out that's just a general description of the IdeaPad 5, not about this model, this model has TN display with only 250nits and less than 50% sRGB color accuracy, it's just not good.It is a shame though since all the other parts are amazing. If you don't mind having a small view angle then go for it, seriously, but for me that's a deal breaker.

  Amazing value for the money, the AMD processor will handle anything you throw at it, and the battery life is great. My only gripe is the screen, which is pretty bland and washed out compared to other laptops I've had, but its to be expected given the price point.

  This is a powerful laptop, screen is not that great but is good enough for coding on the go and programming. The laptop is fully Linux compatible with exception of the trackpad which can be fixed by changing drivers. I don't use it as my main programming computer but it does the work when required.

  First and foremost I don't use this for games so I can't speak to that.But if you want a compact machine that is very competent and very fast for business needs this little thing rocks.

  Buyer beware. My device malfunctioned through no fault of my own. As far as I knew, my device was under warranty with Lenovo. I filed a repair request with them, shipped the device to them, and then a full month later they got back to me and said that my device cannot be repaired because it had been altered. Apparently, the Amazon seller had changed the SSD, so my device was no longer able to be repaired. There's no clear indication on this page on Amazon that the device has been altered in any way. It even says to check the manufacturer's website for warranty information, so I was under the assumption that I had a 1-year warranty with Lenovo. But now I'm here stuck with no device and no warranty to cover the repairs.I will never buy another piece of technology from Amazon after this experience.

  I ran into some initial issues with the keyboard not functioning when I first got this laptop. I did have some assistance from the Lenovo Help Desk that put me in the right direction. Then I discovered that the combination of Windows updating the unit and the eventual updating of drivers from Lenovo apparently cleared up the non-functioning keyboard.  Frustrating for a time, and obviously some bad software timing was to blame. But, in the long run things now seem to be working just fine. Otherwise, this is a well made and easy to use laptop.  Very fast, good visually, acceptably good battery life, and a fairly easy to use touch pad.  The sound is great.  I am looking forward to using this for the portability the next few years when I travel (I am retired).

  I wanted to get a touchscreen laptop for everyday ""couch"" use which includes email, web, video, and some light development for testing ideas.  I specifically wanted something lighter weight and with a touchscreen for every 2 weeks to run Artisan with my temp probes for roasting coffee - the touchscreen making changing the controls and adding markers a lot quicker than trying to hit some of the smaller hitzones in Artisan.  This laptop is very thin and light, love the price/performance, good quality.  The outstanding feature is... the speakers!  OMG, I can actually hear them easily.  Blows away the speakers on my Lenovo 340, HP Pavillion, and 2 MSI gaming notebooks.  I do not need to use an external bluetooth speaker.  So, overall, this meets or exceeds my expectations, is versatile, and so far have had no issues.  NOTE:  The seller I got this from upgrades the SSD and removes the bloatware and the AMD graphics driver was installed so everything was working nicely.

  I had to upgrade my old Lenovo computer after 8 years. I didn't think I could do it. I bought this new Lenovo Flex and so fell in love all over again!!It has all the bells and whistles a techno geek like me needs.It has a finger print unlock feature. This computer has made Windows 10 fun and enjoyable for me. And helped to realize how quick computers are supposed to boot up. And how fast programs and apps are supposed to process. This is one computer thus far that has not let me down. And I have very high expectations when it comes to my tech.As well as my Amazon standards!I can sayCheckCheckBoth have been met.This is worth buying for college students and for running small businesses on as well.

  I rated this laptop as three(3) stars, because I really don't know. It's a beautiful computer, slim, light, nice looking keyboard. Seemed like a five(5) star purchase.  Then - there were a couple of, what should be minor, issues. There was a problem with the display for one program and the keyboard contained many characters that appeared to be optional, but with no information about how to access the optional characters. Numerous, repeated attempts to the get answers about these issues yielded the worst customer service/support I have ever experienced. The question about the display was answered by ""It's a software issue. Cost $40 for us to look at it, or, send it back."" About the keyboard: the tech didn't even recognize the keyboard as described and asked for a picture of it. Sent the picture, but never received a response. We had this computer for a week at this point. The Lenovo website provided no information, except for a manual download that provided no useful information either. I am frustrated to have to send this computer back. It seemed like such a great buy. But, if Lenovo can't provide answers about these two simple issue, I am scared off.

I received the computer and it said  that it was a remanufacted computer then I started trying to set up the computer and the touchscreen didn't work so I got a broken computer from day 1.  I returned the computer only to find out that the company was only going to refund a portion of the money they took $10.62 and didn't give a reason why and another $192.47 for a restocking fee.

  The laptop has actually met expectations in every way. It was the perfect weight and size. The 2 in 1 aspect was very cool, but I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. The Taifu 40W AC adapter (https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B016PRV6KE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 ) was purchased afterwards to keep me from having to have one at home and work. The only thing that I am not sold on is the use of the Micro HDMI versus Display port. It is not sure if Display port is going to stay the standard versus the Micro HDMI. The reason for the problem is the number of adapters is limited for Micro HDMI currently I am using https://smile.amazon.com/Patuoxun-Female-Converter-Adapter-Notebook/dp/B00DNYQBEO/ and it is working well.

  This has by far been the worst laptop I have ever owned. Slim and sexy isn't as good as it sounds for these thin laptops. An egg would've been more durable. The screen is completley shattered, not to mention the 3 seperate crashes, audio issues, major slow down after justa few months of using it, and overall terrible performance. We've all had those moments where we want to just throw our computers in the trash, except that moment happens almost everyday with this thing.

  Hard drive failed a few weeks past the one year warranty. Loved it! Relied on it! Spent really good money for it because I thought the ssd would be durable. What a disappointment that left me hanging. Took it to 2 shops that confirmed that the hard drive failed. Haven't had to take a laptop to a tech for a decade because I know them well enough to keep them running on my own. Pampered this one, now there it sits, pretty, sleek and appearing perfect. Yet it's totally useless. Just says ""Lenovo"" when you try to boot it up.

  I really like this thing.  There are some things I wish were different, but for most purposes it would be great.First a quick note about the size.  I used to get larger laptops -- 15.6"" or 17.3"" -- but finally realized that I always used them connected to big monitors at home and at work, so the display size wasn't an issue.  And on a plane/train/bus, a 14"" laptop is just more manageable.A convertible like this is great on public transit.  On a plane, others can see your screen if you are using a laptop, and then there is the question of elbow space.  But with this thing in tablet mode, it's much more private and compact.  If drinks come, or if you need to get up to let someone else out, it's no big deal.Tablet mode works smoothly -- the first time I twisted the display back, the hinge detected this and a popup appeared asking me if I wanted to go into tablet mode.  And did I want it to do so automatically, without having to answer this?  Yes and yes.  The keyboard is inactivated.  The display rotates automatically so that up is up.  It's a tablet running Windows.It's a bit of a bummer that the laptop doesn't come with an Active Pen -- if you're buying this laptop over another, you probably want to use a pen, but you have to buy it separately.  A bit of a gouge there.  I assume (but am not certain!) that the newer model, the Active Pen 2, also works with this tablet, but it feels way overpriced.  I don't know whether cheaper pens work with this, or whether if they do you get the 8192 pressure levels.The keyboard has a good feel and the backlighting (which is easily turned on and off with Fn-Space) is handy.  The touchpad, which is buttonless, is large.  The fingerprint reader works better than I have had on previous laptops.  The display looks great and the 1920x1080 resolution is, in my opinion, the highest you could really get any value from as a laptop, and very nice as a tablet.  Overall things seem well-engineered and well thought out.The processor is an i5, but these days that means 4 cores and 8 threads -- this thing is significantly faster than my quad-core i7 system from 5ish years ago.  Should be fine for almost everyone.Oh, it says in the title that this has Intel UHD Graphics 615, but that's a mistake -- it should be 620.  That's a function of the processor itself, and the BIOS verifies it as 620.  Not for serious gaming, but more than enough for most other tasks.  It has the HEVC video codec, which is good because video can be streamed to it using better compression techniques, saving network bandwidth, without having to decompress it in software (which is much less efficient).This is a personal aesthetic, but I was really pleased with the color and finish.  They call it Onyx Black, but it's more like a very dark gray, and it's beautiful.  Matte.  It is exactly what I would ask for if I could ask for any finish -- I was delighted.Apart from the annoying lack of a pen, the two things you are most likely to dislike about this unit are the 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD.  Honestly, that should be enough for most people, but some fraction of us really do need more.  It's not impossible to upgrade, but it's not convenient.  So here's my controversial takeaway on this laptop: it's great, but you should consider the version with the Ryzen 5 processor -- it has 12GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and comes with an Active Pen.  And with all of that, it's cheaper (as I write this).  AMD's new Ryzen processors appear to be quite good, so you're not giving up anything there.  And to top it all off, they claim longer battery life.  Also remember that a 256GB SSD allows you to store *more* than twice as much, because something like 30GB of disk is needed by the OS -- you're getting something like 2.5 times the usable space.  Same for the RAM -- going from 8 to 12GB is more than a 50% increase in usable memory, because Windows takes something like 2GB off the top.  The screen on that model is of lower resolution, though.One final note -- if you are interested in putting Linux on this, there is a hiccup (beyond the fact that 128GB is a little tight for a dual-booted system).  Linux installers don't see the SSD, so you have to go to the BIOS to put it in AHCI mode.  But when you go to do that, it warns you that the disk will be erased.  WHAT?  No thanks.  Some sites say no, it won't really happen; others give commands to execute to do it safely.  I took a stab at it and managed to get Linux installed, but then couldn't access Windows -- it couldn't see the disk in AHCI mode.  I'll try again, but I wish it were easier!

  My 13 year old saved his money for almost a year to buy this laptop. I ordered it yesterday and received it today.

  After looking at several laptops to choose from I finally settled on this one.  I was not looking for a 2 in 1 but now that I have it it is very hands to set it up upright when I'm using it for a cooking recipe or doing yoga.  It's noce not to have the keyboard in the way and possibily spilling something on it when cooking.  The combination of I5 processor with ample memory and SSD storage for the price was great.  It boots up really fast and the touch screen is nice too.  I am very happy with it and also was able to get the extended 3 year Lenovo factory warranty from Lenovo after I registered it.

  I Do not recommend this product! It worked well for a short period of time but after 5 months the screen is just black when the computer is on. It was never dropped or really even moved from our desk, it just stopped working. It is an issue I have found to be fairly common with this model after doing some research. We tried multiple tech supports and help desks and nothing has fixed this issue.Also it does not support certain features of regular windows, for example, certain programs can‚Äôt be downloaded and used, and fonts can be downloaded but not installed.Stay away, Save your money for something else. Do not buy!

  I'm no computer geek, and I haven't really spent THAT MUCH time with this computer yet, but I can honestly say that it is a pretty good machine: first, the computer came in mint condition, properly packaged to protect it from any rough handling, so no complaints there. Second, while I'm not a big fan of Microsoft and/or Windows 10, I'm reasonably satisfied with its features: there's still a lot of unwanted/unnecessary redundancies and bloatware, which I plan on trimming eventually, but generally speaking it's ok.I bought this laptop to replace a crappy HP one which I bought on 2016's Black Friday and which, believe it or not, is currently on its very last legs (which in and by itself is depressing on SO MANY levels‚Ä¶.). I'm not a power PC user by any stretch of the imagination: I essentially use it for Office based work, e-mailing, web navigation, streaming and the occasional video game, and my old HP had a lousy performance in all of those areas right out of the box.Therefore, I am pleased to say that this new Ideapad has essentially solved all issues: it is lighting fast, to the point of essentially being on par with the 2017 Lenovo Thinkpad I got at work, which has a 7th generation Core i7 processor, so that's good.The screen looks gorgeous, and the touchscreen response is great, maybe even a bit too good, so I'll probably have to play a little with the settings to get it to work in a way that better suits my style. Either that, or just disable it fully: to be honest, I didn't even want a touchscreen to begin with, but this was, in my opinion, the best Core i5 equipped computer I could find in my price range (not to mention the best reviewed one). I can't really speak about battery life, since I never use it unplugged.The one BIG disappointment? I've grown used to work while playing music from laptop into my stereo using Bluetooth and believe it or not, that is the ONE thing my old crappy HP computer can do and this new one can't: I have no idea why, I've already downloaded the most recent Bluetooth drivers, and nothing: the signal just breaks completely over a distance of about 19 feet: it works fine if I'm in the same room as my stereo, but that sort of defeats the whole purpose of playing the music from the computer as opposed as doing it manually with the stereo, doesn't it? And again, if that sounds like a big distance to you (it doesn't to me), I'll repeat what I just said: my crappy old 2016 HP does manage to do so. And I also conducted a test with an iPhone, and I successfully managed to play music over the same distance as my old PC, so.... there's  something really wrong AND annoying AND aggravating going on there‚Ä¶.So, all in all, I'm satisfied, but not specially thrilled: I honestly expected this new laptop to blow my old one right out of the water in every conceivable way, and while it has done so in most respects, that Bluetooth issue is really aggravating, but as a simple PC to handle most usual tasks with ease and speed, I believe this one should do reasonably well for most people.

  I am the Chairman of a Technology Company that makes apps and decided to go to Lenovo for the first time.

The screen hinge, for me, has the right balance of resistance and ease of opening. The screen sets very nicely in the frame. Keyboard style is a personal choice, but I like a more ""solid"" keyboard with some travel, but not too much. Typing on this keyboard feels firm even though the laptop is very light.

I'll describe my usage, and readers can extrapolate from that to roughly assess how this laptop might work for them. I have run a number of tasks on this system. Some of them are not very memory-intensive, such as checking e-mail, web browsing, document and spreadsheet work, and editing code (which is done in a simple text editor). I have thrown a lot at this laptop and it has managed it all. I think 16GB would be better for SPEED.BATTERY LIFEThis has a bit of a range. When doing pretty simple tasks, the battery clocks in for me around 7 hours of solid use. When doing more intensive video editing, it came in closer to a 6-hour range. I'd day this is about normal for a laptop of this type. I am a power user so this is expected in terms of what I do. Carry the charger and no issues.CONCLUSIONSAfter using this laptop for a couple of months in a variety of situations and for a range of tasks, I find it to be an attractive, well-designed, capable system. I highly recommend it.

  **Let me start this review by saying I am an IT Professional that works mainly with hardware so I do know a thing or two about a good laptop and a bad laptop. From the other reviews I've seen of this laptop, it's clear that the people reviewing it don't understand the difference between a good laptop and a perfect laptop (that you'd pay $1200-$1400 for). It may be an objectively 4 star laptop out of the box but it has lasted me over 4 years without a noticeable change in performance or reliability (something few laptops at this price point can boast) so it earned that 5th star.This is a very good laptop for a professional on the go. Very light, awesome battery life (I still get over 4 hours of use after 4 years). The screen has some minor flaws but nothing you wouldn't expect out of a $700ish laptop. Core M is surprisingly fast, obviously I would have preferred an i5 instead but hey then I'd lose a couple hours of batter life so it's a fine tradeoff. The hinge is incredible, arguably the best hinge available in a thin and light.

  This is, quite simply, the best computer/laptop I have ever purchased. As a business consultant, I travel constantly and I wanted a laptop that would be ultra-light, reliable, fast, extremely versatile, tough, and looks highly professional. This laptop gets five stars in each of those categories. The picture quality is the best of any laptop I've owned.  The laptop itself is extremely light--something that is important when you are lugging a laptop bag everywhere you go.  The stylish watchband hinge is what gives the Yoga 3 Pro its magic, though. For example, while flying, you can unfold the laptop so it is nearly flat and props against the seat in front of you on the plane, thus allowing you to easily watch videos in an extremely cramped situation. You can put the laptop in 'tent' mode and place it at the head of a meeting table to quickly share presentations for a group. You can easily switch to tablet mode at a lecture and take notes with a stylus.  The keyboard is great, with good travel/pressure on the keys.  Feels 'quality' and, best of all, illuminates when you want it for low light situations.All-in-all, I can't rave enough about this laptop.  The only drawbacks I've noticed so far (and I have been actively using mine for over a month), are:  a) The volume is limited on the speakers.  The volume is loud enough in most circumstances, but not suitable, for instance for playing music while performing other tasks and moving around a room.  With headphones, the volume is fine.  I recommend getting small, peripheral wifi speakers to boost sound when you need it.  b) The built-in camera doesn't seem to be all that great. Not a major issue, depending on how you use the computer, but the pictures seem a little grainy. Not bad, though.  c) Battery life is 'okay'.  On a full charge, my laptop lasts anywhere from 4 to 5 hours. This is less than some other laptops, but in my opinion, a minor issue as I typically have access to a power source during that time. Also, these days you can easily purchase peripheral backup power sources if battery life is a concern, so it's an easy workaround.UPDATE: Since I first purchased this laptop just a few months ago, I discovered a MAJOR design flaw which anyone thinking of buying this laptop should be aware of. It is the battery and charging system. My Yoga 3 Pro functioned fine--until today--right before I was set to use it for a critically important presentation. For some reason, although the system reported the battery was 'in good condition', the power adapter was not being detected and therefore was not charging the battery. (I since went online and found that others have had this issue.) I had to watch helplessly as the power drained from my laptop and I could no longer even turn it on to attempt a fix. And, since the battery is inaccessible without unscrewing and removing the bottom plate of the laptop and thereby voiding its warranty, I could not even swap out the drained battery for a new one, even if I had one available. As a result, I had to call Lenovo Tech Support. The woman I spoke to was in India. She was helpful, to a very limited degree, but the language barrier was severe. More importantly, I should not have even had to call her, since a battery/power issue of this kind is pretty unacceptable for a computer that runs upwards of $1,000. This is a blatant design flaw--and a really bad one. Now, I have to send my still-new laptop away to a service center, hoping to get it back within the next few weeks. My laptop has a ton of valuable data on it and I really need it this week as I am scheduled to do several important presentations. I am NOT happy.

  This computer was great but on 2 year anniversary mark - the computer completely shut down, no warning, completely dark. I had company IT look at it and they said the motherboard was completely shot. They also told me they were dealing with other customers with Lenovo laptops suffering from the same fate. They suspect an overheating issue. Should this computer have a longer life than 2 years? Disappointed. replaced with a DELL

  Would have given 5 stars except for the annoying issue of having to update BIOS within 2 days of receiving the laptop. USB ports would become disabled. I could fix with a power down by removing the battery. This had to be done in the BIOS because there is no battery you can physically remove. BIOS update fixed permanently. Since then the laptop has performed worthy of 5 stars.

  This was a steal of a deal for the price! With tax and everything we got it for $715.  We bought it as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it. The tablet capabilities are a great feature. I would definitely recommend  this laptop to friends and family.

  Just like the Amazon title and product description says, I was expecting to get the Lenovo Yoga 720. But when I got this laptop, everything seem fine until I saw the sticker on it and it says the 730. I thought maybe they use the wrong sticker so I checked inside the system settings and it says the Lenovo Yoga 730. I wasn't even mad, I even went ahead to check the pictures of other reviewers who left a review on here and they all got 730s even when some of the reviews say they have the 720. So it's why I am writing this review to warn people that they are going to be purchasing the 730 and not the 720. Lenovo should fix this on this Amazon Page so they don't give people the wrong idea. It's why I am writing this review because I want to warn people before purchasing. This doesn't mean that the 730 is a bad machine, in fact I am kind of glad I got it. So here is my experience with it so far.When I first got booted it up. It was a nice set up and it was quick and easy. After updating everything from bios to drivers (I recommended to do windows updates first and then download the official Lenovo Vantage software which will update your bios and drivers exactly to what device you have), it started to run fast and smoothly. As this is a convertible laptop, probably my favorite to use this is in tent mode while on my lap. Which is great if you just want to watch videos on this laptop. Also if you want to draw, it will be nice and sturdy on your lap while in tent mode. If you have just in regular laptop mode, you will notice that the bottom of the device will get a little hot. Since the intake fans are on the bottom, you are blocking it while it is on your lap which I don't like how that is design at all.Speaking of fans, that is the only thing I dislike about the 730. If it's really being used while playing heavy games or heavy use like video editing, then it will sound like a airplane taking off! Like before I update everything, it kept running that loud constantly but after I update it stop doing that until, like I said, doing heavy uses with the laptop. So that's the only thing I dislike about it. Speaking of games, it runs smooth for the most part. That's why one of my screenshot is me playing Sonic Generations since I wanted to test if it can run and keep up with that game. Which it did run smoothly with a few jitters here and there.But out of all those things it is still a great device. Keyboard is responsive, can easily bend it forward and backwards from laptop to tablet mode, and it is fast and smooth after the update. I am still a little bit dissapointed that it wasn't the 720 but I am still having a good time with this device and getting the 730 should not discourage you to not buy it.

  ¬†This computer has a good Battery, great shape, but it was defective on the screen as many other buyers said on the reviews.Im traveling abroad and the computer screen stopped working, now that i have access to another computer to put the claim in Amazon, the Last Return Date is gone.i've been buying many things from amazon for years, and this is my first time with such a bad experience.

  This is probably the best of all laptops I had in the past 18 years. High quality, very light to travel (I did already travel 10,000 km with the Yoga at different environments and type of current, easy to find and locate the WiFi), now with external mouse and DVD driver and fully set with it. Love it, and will be more if I can upgrade the RAM memory to 16 GB. One thing I am not certain - can it use digital pen/stylus? I am hearing contradictory opinions at the Lenovo club. But in general - excellent product, I think is better than Microsoft Edge (my opinion).

  At first, it worked flawlessly. However, I did notice that the screen would flicker every now and then. I updated the drivers, but the issue was with the hardware. Something in the display is often loosened when used frequently, and so the screen can become completely unusable. The only quick fix to this is by leaving something heavy on top of it. I‚Äôve sent it off to be repaired by professionals, but it only briefly solved the issue. Since I sent it off to be repaired, I didn‚Äôt get a refund and the period to do so ended. Now I have a somewhat functioning laptop that will likely end up as scrap whenever I get the chance to replace it. I suggest buying a Dell Inspiron or XPS instead.

  It checked all the boxes, lightweight, runs cool, backlit keyboard, and is pretty snappy. My wife was unhappy with her tablet due to the lack of functionality and this was the answer.

  I was really excited when I got this laptop. I had taken much time to research all the specs and this seemed like an excellent buy. However after only using this a total of three times I no longer can access the laptop. I set up a pin, a password and my fingerprint and now none of these work. So all my documents which I have saved on it I cannot access. Amazon states that this is a technical problem and advised that I contact Lenovo directly. I was refered to the website but cannot access the chat because I am not resident in the US or Canada. So I tried calling over and over and over and over and still cannot get any assistance. Having spent all this money on this laptop I would have expected at least some level of customer support. My advice buy this only if you have money to throw away! Very disappointed in the laptop and the lack of customer service! If i could give zero stars I would have.

  Previously, I had a Lenovo Yoga 2 for 4 years and I fell in love with Lenovo laptops. I received this one as a Christmas gift and it is great! The Lenovo Yoga 720 is portable while being durable at the same time. I use it for my college classes and keep it in my bookbag. The battery life lasts me all day and the processor has enough haul for my Engineering classes.However, initially, I had some issues with resolution and windows being slightly blurry. It was not the whole screen, but only certain apps and websites. After playing with some fo the resolution settings I don't seem to have an issue with it anymore.It has been a great laptop and I look forward to getting more Lenovo computers in the future.

  This Lenovo is decent for the price I paid. Kept dropping WiFi so had to download updated driver, then all was well. Fast and quiet, decent screen resolution. Not a gaming laptop but Sims, Minecraft, Netflix, youtube, etc., run great. Only issue is battery life. Seems to last 3 hours max which is a little disappointing. Great seller - item arrived quick, well packed and in perfect condition. I would buy again.

  Ordered the 320 and received the 330s with 4G fewer RAM. The box for the computer had two labels, one from the company stating 320 and one from Lenovo stating 330. I ordered two of these computers for my team back in July but just now needed to open up this second one to find that it is the wrong computer.

  The battery percent didn‚Äôt match with the remaining lifetime due the battery was damage, being a brand new laptop!. Please be aware that people invest time and money to buy a good product, you should check your items before selling them... I bought this computer because I needed it, for work, after having to return the laptop I have spent 1 more week waiting for the refund and by the time I haven‚Äôt received the refund yet...and I need the money to buy a computer again. It is annoying going through all this process when I was supposed to have my laptop already.

  The biggest problem was getting into the BIOS settings so I could turn off UEFI and the Windows Boot Manager. Try as I might hitting the documented hot key wouldn't let me into the BIOS following power up. I ended up booting into Windows and restarting into the BIOS from there. But once in I was able to boot and install Ubuntu off of the USB stick. All the hardware worked perfectly.Lenovo continues to deserve its reputation of having good support for Linux nuts like me. I do wish they would ship the unit with the BIOS configured to allow easy entry into it at power up via a hot key (turn off Fast Boot). Having to boot into Windows just to get to the BIOS was kind of a pain.

  This is a fantastic laptop. I‚Äôve only had it a week so I haven‚Äôt fully broken it in. If I have any significant issues within the year I will update this review. But so far it is very good. Same exact internal stats as an $1800 13‚Äù MacBook Pro. However, there‚Äôs a better graphics card, bigger screen, thinner bezels, touch screen, number pad, AND more ports! All for over twice less! Unless you need Mac OS, this is a phenomenal laptop. Zero regrets!

  over all I am satisfied with this purchase. My only complaint is the graphics quality since I am using it for trading assets. The chart quality is a bit lacking in detail and the colors are lack luster. Perhaps I missed something setting it up because I have not found a way to adjust the color brightness..The good news is that it is plenty fast, has all the features I need, is light weight and sturdy.This is a great laptop if graphics are not a major concern, but again I may have missed something?

  Estoy completamente satisfecho con el equipo, despues de una semana de uso y aqui una breve rese√±a espero le sirva a alguien si considera esta laptop.#1: Estetica: No tiene una estetica brillante, un acabado mate en un color gris al que llamo ""Gris Lenovo"",  la sensacion en ella es de un equipo profesional y una linea elegante sin ser muy vistoza, cosa que me gusta porque no me distrae su exterior, el logo de lenovo lo encuentras solo en un lado de sus caras y es bastante peque√±o, marcos de la pantalla super reducidos apenas unos 5mm en los lados y 1 cm en la parte superior, mostrando solo la pantalla.#2: Teclado retro iluminado: toda laptop con un valor minimo de 500$ en mi opinion debe incluir esta funcion, y es super util, el teclado se siente bien y no me equivoco, no incluye botones adicionales, una distribucion adecuada debo decir, para el trabajo de desarrollo que hago me va muy bien.#3 Privacidad: La opcion de bloquear FISICAMENTE el lente de la camara con la pesta√±a me da un aire mas de privacidad y me es util, cuando en realidad no estoy para que me vean en video conferencias (truco).#4 Velocidad de app: La carga e instalacion de aplicaciones es super rapida gracias a su disco solido, si alguien lee esta rese√±a buscando una laptop, en serio no compres laptop con HDD, es una tecnologia obsoleta en estos dias.#5 Rendimiento: no me convencia la opcion de intel teniendo un atractivo modelo (mas costoso) con procesadores Ryzen, pero, aun tengo mis reservas con AMD en laptops, dado que he tenido 4 laptops con procesadores Athlon de AMD y todas tienen problemas en su tarjetas graficas, y me ha tocado hacer revaling en sus puntos frios, este procesador I5 no me ha dejado mal, incluso he editado videos en Adobe Premier sin problemas, programas como Xampp y entornos de trabajo con nodeJS procesan con exito todos los trabajos que coloco, photoshop, lightroom corren excelente, incluso Illustrator. con estos 16Gb de ram creo que chrome puede consumir lo que quiera y aun no experimento retraso en las operaciones.#NO TODO ES PERFECTO. El unico apartado que encuentro un tanto dudoso es su bateria y es que cuando la apago me marca un porcentaje, y parece que se consume la bateria mientras esta apagada, aun es pronto para confirmar esto, pero aun asi he obtenido 7 horas y 32 minutos de autonomia con una carga. Por otro lado, su cargador es portatil pero su cable es muy corto, es de carga rapida pero me obliga a estar muy cerca de una toma para poder cargar y trabajar al mismo tiempo.En definitva. UNA GRAN LAPTOP.RECOMENDADA

  I‚Äôm not a gamer but bought this for music production. It‚Äôs fast and light. This is my first Lenovo, having used Dells for 20 years. There are a few differences. The power block on the Lenovo as opposed to the standard three prong plug on most Dells is taking getting used to. I like the matte screen. Im not sure how to use the USB C connector yet, I dont have any use for it. Otherwise the feel is solid without being heavy. Doesnt get hot and the backlit keyboard has a nice feel. Im not pleased with the firmness of the trackpad but perhaps it will loosen over time? I usually use a mouse anyway.

  I bought mine upgraded to 1T HDD - I didn't realize that this would mean that it did NOT have the full 1 year warranty. But that is on me as it was listed as Like New and $150 or so less than the New one - I purchased the extended warranty for that $150 so I know that I will have this laptop (or a replacement) for 4 years.  The laptop I received appeared in brand new condition other than the larger HDD and the 45 day warranty.  I really like the laptop!  It was a replacement for a Dell I purchased here on Amazon about 2 years ago - I bought the extended warranty on that one too and the warranty paid for this replacement.This laptop had all the features that were important t me!  Backlit Keyboard - 16mb memory - 1TB HDD - 15"" screen . Then to my surprise it is the lightest weight laptop I have ever owned! Even lighter than my tiny 12"" IBM from 20+ years ago! I think it is thanks to Google that the setup of everything went so smoothly and easily, but I always dread having to set up a new PC and this one was not bad at all!  In fact, easiest ever.  Oh yes - the fingerprint reader! I didn't list that as one of the things that was important to me because the laptops that I have owned in the past that had one - well, they just were not that great. This one is awesome!  It really works well! But now I will really never remember a password!! Lastly - this laptop does NOT get as hot as my Dell did!  I would have to put something between me and the PC to avoid burns with my Dell - this one just does not get that hot!I cannot speak to longevity as I just got i about 10 days ago.  I will update this if there is a problem in the future.

  Nice looking laptop, it's too bad we can't use it because the screen doesn't turn on and it won't output through its HDMI port either. Can't even enter BIOS/laptop won't POST as far as I can tell. The power light comes on as if it's sleeping or running and when charging but that is the only indication that the item even has any working component. No noises. No fans turn on or hard disk noises etc. USB peripherals don't receive any power or data. Monitors don't receive anything. Happy birthday to my wife!

  My daughter LOVED this right out of the box! Especially after having a big, heavy i3 laptop, this was a treat. Easy set up, ultrafast, ultralight, and beautifully styled on top. She did not think the shift key was an issue. This arrived beautifully packaged, fortunately, for though I thought it needed to be signed for, UPS or USPS (I forget which) left it in below zero temps on the doorstep. Highly recommended and the price was crazy great through Adorama. Quicker than expected delivery too, rather than 7-10 days free delivery it arrived in 2-3. I would Definitely buy the same product again.

  Overall there's a lot to like about this laptop. It's light, has great specs for an ultra book in this price range but that i7 chip and GPU must require a lot of cooling because the fan seems to run almost continuously. Bios updates from Lenovo didn't help, nor did adjusting the power plan. So if your looking for a whisper quiet unit this may not be for you.Ultimately though, what killed the deal for me is the fact that the unit I received was just plain old slow. I was replacing a 4th generation i3 system and running apps side-by-side, the i3 was faster! Lenovo wants me to wait a couple weeks till it ""settles in"" . Time will tell

  This computer is perfect for my needs. Very lightweight, comfortable keyboard, charger stays plugged in, useful apps right out the gate. No it's not a gaming or ultra-processing computer, but I just need something to pay the bills on, check work emails, and watch a little Netflix when I'm on vacation. And it's perfect for that. The battery life is a little short (I'd say like 1.5 hours of USE), but the plug stays in so well with a super long cable that if I know I'm about to marathon some paperwork I just plug it in and it's not noticeable.

  Specialized and detailed reviews are everywhere. So I'm just going to comment on some aspects that other reviews (not only on Amazon) have mentioned.Mobility: This laptop is so slim that I can even put it in my Gregory Miwok 18's hydration reservoir! Its adapter is a very small one, too. If you haven't seen the adapter before, I recommend you to have a look. So actually, I put the laptop, the adapter and a wireless mouse all together in a *hydration reservoir*! It's really amazing. Also, it's very lightweighted like no more than a book.Appearance: Simply beautiful and I really like it.Dispaly: The screen displays very well. IPS. Wide viewing angle. Vivid color. High maximum brightness. I didn't see any shortcoming in this screen.Computing performance: I am a programmer. Running several IDEs, browsers, applications, no probelm at all. (the model I bought: i7+8g)Graphical performance: I can play Overwatch on it, with the lowest effect and 30 FPS. I am honestly quite satisfied about that embedded graphic processor's performance.Bloatware: I cleared out the entire disk and installed Win 10 on it. In fact, I did this on EVERY laptop I bought. So the bloatware is not a problem for me.The only problem, maybe is the right SHIFT key. Really need to get used to that awful position.(This is my first review on Amazon. I am not a native English speaker, but I am trying.)

  It has been 2 weeks since I got my Lenovo, it is a great device working fluently, very light weight, well built quality. The screen is looking amazing with the full HD view  The part I did not like was that the one year Lenovo warranty was expired. Overall it is a great  deal for me.

  This is a very good laptop for the price. It can run most software programs with ease and it is very high quality. The only thing that I didn't like however was that the shift key is smaller than most laptops. It was hard to have to relearn the key placements, but it wasn't that big of a deal. Overall, it is very nice and I would definitely recommend it.

  I have never in my life had such a souring computer experience. For the past 3 1/2 years I have dealt with a computer incapable of even the most standard expectations of a modern laptop.I have only used this laptop for recording music, no gaming or additional activities that might lead to risk of viruses or the like.This laptop, when it decides to run, does so at a pace so inconceivably slow that I could teach myself calculus as a productive side activity while I wait for it to LITERALLY JUST LOAD TO THE DESKTOP. I have had loading screens just to bring up the TASK MANAGER - WHICH SAYS NO APPS ARE RUNNING DESPITE CLOCKED OUT CPU USAGE.By the way, I am typing this from my previous Lenovo laptop I got back in 2012, because it still performs better.On my deathbed, I think my greatest regret in life that I utter to my wife and kids, assuming I am the first to go, will be not returning this trashcan of a computer the moment I noticed the signs of treachery it would inflict upon me for the remainder of its lifetime.I know Best Buy has no way to remedy this, and I know Lenovo will do no better, but I decided that shouting into the void with this almost-four-years-in-the-making-review would be easier on my vocal chords and my neighbor's ears than the the violent screaming I traditionally do inches away from the computer screen.If inanimate objects could be sent to Hell, I nominate this to be the first visitor.Not only will I not recommend this to a friend, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

  While the descrition does not say either way the pictures show the backlight button on the space bar and when looking at this laptop pretty much anywhere it seems this is a pretty standard option.  The particular model I received is not equiped with it.  If this is a feature you are looking forward to as I was perhaps look for this same computer under a different model number.  Outside of this it is a perfect computer for what I need and touchpad is great, keyboard is great, nice to have the separate buttons for mouse clicks in some situiations is helpfull.  I have always been a Lenovo fan because they are built very well and durable. Overall the computer is great but I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard.  Not a huge dealbreaker but would have been great to have.  If this is important to you I highly recomend this computer just maybe shop around for it under a differnt model number.

  I haven't owned a windows computer for the longest time because in the past they have been very slow and experienced a lot of issues. After getting the Lenovo ThinkPad, it has changed my mind on windows computers and I have really enjoyed using it. I have been more productive with this computer because of how fast it runs even with many programs at the same time. The screen size is great and has a great picture quality. I like that it doesn't come with much too much unnecessary bloatware that many windows computers come with. The keyboard feels very comfortable and responsive. The number keypad on the side is very convenient as well. Overall I really like the laptop have had a great experience with it so far.

  I got this laptop for $650 dollars. At first I thought it might be a scam or something because there's only like 10 reviews. But no, it's actually completely legit and, in my opinion, it was an amazing deal for what I paid.The laptop itself was sealed band new in the original unopened box from Lenovo with no obvious signs of tampering or poor handling.Pros:Advantages and disadvantages:+It actually does have dedicated graphics (NVIDIA gtx 1650)+pretty affordable (I got it for $650)+the keyboard is pretty good (it also has a back light so you can type in the dark)+good design and a good build quality (even though it is all plastic, it still feels premium)+Although I haven't trying stressing it yet, the fan seems to be very quiet at least in lower stress situationsCons:-The power connector doesn't use a barrel jack, but some weird rectangle variant of it-only 8gbs of ram (I think there's an empty slot to put another stick in)-only 250gbs of storage (I think there's also a drive bay to add a more storage in the form of an ssd or hdd)Conclusion: This laptop is over all a great deal and with a simple ram and storage upgrade, it probably would make for a great low budget gaming setup.

  It is a good laptop, loved the screen, nice keyboard, lights. I think just 2 things that I really hated were battery life and overheating. With battery life on the amazon page and on behalf of lenovo representatives it should last 6-8 hours.. and well mine just lasted 2 hours using 3 chrome tabs, no keyboard lights.. which sucks..Second, it gets really hot just by using chrome or YouTube.. I tried to play paladins which is not a heavy game and the computer was on 89-91 degrees hot..Besides this two, it is a good laptop for its price.

  Fantastic laptop for everyday use. I had to move away from my Macbook Air 11.6 as my eyes and work couldn't stand the small screen anymore. I always liked Yoga and this was a perfect opportunity to try it. I am supper happy with the bright screen, backlight keyboard, touchpad and overall sturdy feel of the laptop. I was originally planning on purchasing it in Best Buy but found the better price on Amazon and since it was through a 3rd party seller they wouldn't match it. Their loss, for a $100 difference they lost $700. Anyway, laptop arrived quickly, but I was surprised that it wasn't charged. It does charge quickly though and I love that it has the USBC so I can use the same charger for my laptop, Ipad Pro, Samsung Note 10+ and Samsung earbuds. Win-win.

  I am not a very technical person but I really like this laptop. I like the sleek design and the overall look. It is really fast and has no trouble keeping up with me hopping from site to site or with me working from home. This is the second one I bought though. I returned the first one because when listening/watching videos the volume would just stop for a few seconds every 15 or 20 minutes. Surprisingly this laptop did the same thing. When I switch browsers from Microsoft Edge to Google Chrome the problem went away. I really was glad that was all it was. Like I said...I really like this laptop! I use it almost everyday. I have had it for about a month and I am 100% satisfied.

  This laptop is built extremely well. I bought this at $800. The display could be a bit brighter. When you do turn the brightness all the way up the battery life tanks. The i5 gets hot under load and the fans kick in to the max when under load. There is a bit of display flickering. But overall serves my use cases very well, which are academics and entertainment. The pen input is a lifesaver when conducting classes online.Update: The flickering issue was due to a graphics setting. It can be fixed by turning off ""Display power savings"" under the ""power"" section in the intel graphics command center.

  Just want to start off by saying that I did not buy this laptop via Amazon but want to warn everyone I can. I bought the laptop on 12/24/2020. It worked just great until the end of March when it completely died. Was on the phone with Lenovo support for a few days trying to convince them that the unit was in fact dead. Anyway, the laptop was received by Lenovo's depot repair in Texas on 4/5/2021. The only notification I have received was on 5/5/2021 when I got an email from a 3rd party company stating they had my laptop for repair. It's been silence since.  It's now 5/22/2021 and I have no idea as to the status of my laptop. One final note. All parties are blaming Covid for the delay issues. Well that may be partially true I looked at some comments on the Lenovo customer forums and saw similar and even worse repair delays going back to 2017. So it is not all Covid. This is a fundamental staffing issue with the Lenovo support group.

  After spending 3-4 hours getting software and data files set up on the computer, I found out the camera is defective. It captures something very blurry, it shows lights in the room but very darkly and nothing else. The only option with amazon and the seller is to return to laptop. But after spending so much time getting it set up, I'm opting for a separate webcam rather than going through the hassle of returning it and setting up the new one again. With less and less videoconferencing these days, it seemed like the best thing to do.Otherwise, I think it's going to be a good laptop.My advice, test everything before setting up software and data files. I learned the hard way!

  I've had this a little more than a week now and for the most part I'm happy with it.  I would probably have given it a 5 star rating, but the few things that are annoying are REALLY annoying for me.  As mentioned in other reviews, the right shift key is just in such an awkward spot that it slows me down when typing.  And if I don't consciously think about it I just end up moving the cursor to a line up and start typing in the middle of something else.  The next one is not as big a deal, but it took me all week to find the ""end"" button because I was looking at the top of the keyboard, but it's on the arrow key under shift.  It also doesn't automatically go to the end of the line.  Because it is also the right arrow it only moves one space, and when you use control it only moves to the end of the word.  But again, awkward position for me and will take some reprogramming of my brain.  Other than that, I love the size and weight.  I needed something lightweight for school and this fits the bill without breaking the bank.  I think I will eventually get used to the keyboard and everything will be just fine.  I've never had a 2-in-1 before, and I love the touchscreen ability as well.  Super helpful for drawing a diagram in Word.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase, if that changes in the future, so will my review.

  UPDATE: After only 2 years it has apparently died. Tried during it on and it's nothing but a black screen. The power light turns on, but that is about the extent of its potential. No longer hear anything turning on, such as a fan, but it gets warm if the screen is left open. Trouble shooted it with:1. Enabling the screen by pressing fn and f22. Held the windows button and hit p twice3. Hard reset by unplugging actually adapter and holding the power button4. Purchased a cord to connect it to an external monitor.... blackness stillAND NOTHING! Its disappointing considering a HP laptop that I have had for nearly a decade still works beautifully, while this Lenova barely made it 2 years of light useLove how compact it is. Perfect for class notes and studying during the commute.

  I finally found a highly portable netbook sized laptop with strong performance. Unlike most laptops this size, the Yoga 710, with an i5 processor and plenty of RAM has the performance and quality of a full size laptop. And with it's tiny size and light weight, it goes anywhere.This is ALMOST the perfect highly portable computer. My only complaint is that it only has one usb port.

  Bought this for my wife.  It serves her needs perfectly.Keep working on battery life time.  There were other products like the Microsoft 2 in 1's with more battery life but they were heavier.My wife was hoping for something easy to carry that was between two and two and one half pounds and this fit the bill.It is shy on connections but that was known before hand.  It targets WiFi connectivity.  She loves it so far.

  Compressed keyboard takes some getting used to, since the Shift key is closer in than with ""normal"" sized laptops. Also learn how to adjust the touch pad or you will go batty. Otherwise, a small lightweight laptop with good screen. So far, so good.

  Bought this for my wife.  She lets the boy use it.  Very fast.  Sleek design.  Touch screen works perfect.  No problems at all from this little workhorse.  Highly recommended for someone who wants more than a tablet, but not a laptop.  Really did a good job of marrying the best characteristics of both.

  It lasted until November and then died permanently.  Won't even turn on.  Of course, the warranty had expired two months earlier.  Was nice while it lasted, but ultimately a real disappointment.

  First Week:So far I am really enjoying this laptop, it is mostly quiet, very light, and the battery lifespan is better then I expected. I can get about 4-6 hours of battery life depending on the situation. I haven't played many games yet but it has been great as a work/school computer so far. The keyboard is also really awesome, although it doesn't feel as nice as more expensive laptops. The screen resolution is really clear as well, and honestly, for the price, I feel like it was a great choice for myself.

  I was hesitant to buy a laptop without actually seeing it in person first, especially one that had zero reviews at the time of purchase, but I took a chance because this laptop was exactly what I was looking for and much cheaper than I‚Äôd seen similar setups elsewhere.The Lenovo Legion generally has very positive reviews among all the research I did, and this particular model had everything I wanted; a good Ryzen processor and GTX graphics card, lots of storage, a really nice 120Hz display, and most importantly, the price was exactly what I could spend without going over budget.Setting it up was pretty simple and I haven‚Äôt had any problems with it yet. Also, there wasn‚Äôt really any ‚Äúbloat ware‚Äù installed on it, which was greatly appreciated.Granted, I‚Äôve only had this for about a week, so if something happens, I‚Äôll definitely update, but so far so good. And I just wanted to put this up in case anyone else was in the same position I was.Now I‚Äôm just slowly getting my games installed, and everything plays really well. Not always at the highest settings, but close enough.So if you‚Äôre looking for an upper mid-range laptop, this is definitely the best value for the money that I could find.  Sure it doesn‚Äôt have the newest processor or graphics card, but you‚Äôre also gonna double the price if you want all that. But for playing League of Legends, Genshin Impact, Diablo, and all the Steam titles I already owned, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this purchase.Also, I gotta give a shout out to Oydisen Electronics for hooking this up. They did an excellent job of adding all the bells and whistles (more Ram and a second hard drive etc.), and I‚Äôd definitely buy from them again in the future.*(edit- I mentioned the wrong seller in my original review)

  At the time of writing this, there are no issues. Does everything I want it to. I don't really play that demanding games but even then could probably run at medium. Runs well and fast has performance mode when plugged into the charger. Has the 16gbs of ram that it stated was upgraded to and everything I've done on it and or played has run great. For me, this is for when I travel and or are just out away from my desktop.

  After months of hitting refresh, I've finally given up on trying to get a Playstation 5.I'd been reading about and contemplating just getting a Gaming PC instead. Before I bought this I went to a bunch of stores in person and researched different CPUs and graphics cards to make sure I had what I'd need to game, as my older laptop (from 2014) and Dell Optiplex can't handle games.I didn't want to spend more than $1000 on a new device but didn't want to cheap out on something that didn't have everything I need.To the point, this Gaming Laptop was a great deal, 1 TB HHD and 250 GB SSD is plenty of storage space to hold games, photos, movies, music, personal files, etc.I tested a few free games on Steam and the graphics and speed are awesome. Finally I have a PC that can handle newer games.The product pictures tell you everything you need to know. Cyberpunk 2077!I'm sure this will be able to handle Call of Duty: Cold War as well.Hopefully this computer will last me several years before needing to upgrade.The screen, 15.6 inch, is a bit small from what I'm used to but that's okay. Don't be afraid to spend extra if you want better specs.

  I was hesitant to purchase this laptop since it didn't have many reviews. But I bought it mainly because of the 16GB of memory and the Intel Core i7 processor. According to my brother, who works in IT, this is a perfect combination. I also wanted a touchscreen and convertible laptop.It has been 3 months since I bought it and I LOVE IT. The size is perfect (not too big to carry it, not too small that you can't see anything), and it is incredibly light for its size. Besides, the graphics' quality is excellent, I just turned on my old laptop, and the difference is abysmal.  What makes me love it more is the little details that make my life easier, like shortcuts, keys location, features, etc.The only thing I can't review is the option to handwrite or draw, I know you can buy a pen for that, but my job doesn't require to write or draw.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

  So, I just got this laptop at costco, spent entire weekend installing programs, only to find out camera is not working. Went on Costco.com and read reviews -  bunch of people having the same problem. Contacted lenovo through chat and was told my only option is a factory reset ???? When I refused, I was told to download driver, had to ask for link, that had not solved the problem. Other than that, if you are switching from another brand, you are probably going to find the keyboard completely weird and annoying ( page up keys are gone , you have the function but need both hands to actually use it) . If you are using SD card, which I do as my HD back up, normal size SD card will stick halfway out. As for Lenovo chat support - I can't still fathom what I just experienced, and I will leave it at that. Other than that, it performs as it should, given the specs. Quiet heavy for 14"", and the touchpad is very iffy - many reviewers complain about this as well. Truly hope I will find a patch for the camera and that everything else will keep working as it should, would hate to have reinstall again. Would be nice to knwo from lenovo, which SD card will be good fit for this PC, asked the chat tech about it but he could not care less. Truly hope I wont have to reach out to Lenovo support  ever again

  It shipped quickly but packaging could be a bit better. Don‚Äôt skimp on bubble wrap and cardboard for items of this price and fragility. The Yoga is, so far, as advertised - very sleek, versatile and fast - great machine. Setup was simple. I‚Äôve streamed and downloaded multiple movies and haven‚Äôt experienced any noise or heat as in other reviews. Jury‚Äôs still out I guess. It is frustrating, however, to be continually lifting the laptop and checking the underside for heat due to what I read what others have experienced. It has been cool to the touch thus far. Perhaps one day I will just relax about it. Will definitely update the review should that problem arise. To date, excellent laptop and highly recommended.

  The screen--FULL HD---with a million colors...absolutely beautiful. The performance...i7 and 12 Gigs at 1.8 processor...fantastic. The dolby atmos sound....awsome. Keyboard is great...you won't have any issues...the fancy 15 version with i7 with the fancy internals---gets the fancy screen with 500 nits. Outdoor visibility not a problem. God I love this laptop.....but we have 2 and a half problems. Lets start with the half problem and work our way up.half of an issue- this thing feel very heavy- I held other laptops at 15.6 inches and they did not feel this heavy. Minor nitpick but at 1000 dollars we have to nitpick.1 issue - false advertising. The guy who made this laptop in a YouTube video is recorded s saying when we made the 15 inch version--we put the full size keyboard and a bigger battery with which we aimed at as much as 15 hours of on time. The TRUTH-you will be lucky if you get 5 or 6 hours depending on your settings.THE BIG PROBLEM--About 8 months into the ownership experience....fan started making strange scratching noises and it always sounds loud when it is running. The device in the fan area gets very hot. I search on Google and many people complaining about a loud sounding fan. I search on YouTube and I find people refusing to buy the device after doing some heat tests--some even recommening you look at other companies instead.So what is the overall verdict...it is simple...Good Battery life but don't expect great battery life--keep the cable handy not a problem. It gets a little hot and you can hear the fan. Keep a cooling fan pad under it or something else..work on it. Get an extended warranty with local repairs. THIS IS BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET PAST THESE 2 ISSUES--it is by far the best laptop I have ever owned. It is a flawless masterpiece. All those 4.7 reviews you see on Google and Best Buy. They didn't just happen for no reason. This is a masterpiece of a laptop. If they had the cooling down better and it did not get as hot...this would be a easy recommend. As is, I still remommend this device--all devices have problems...just be mindful of the fact that it gets hot.

Connect to Wi-Fi only after your done with that step.If you accidentally connected to the Wi-Fi and encounter the error I mentioned above, restart the computer by holding down the power button for a few seconds. If it does not let you restart the setup from the beginning, let the laptop battery die completely and then try again from scratch. You can alternatively unscrew the laptop from underneath, pry the bottom off carefully using 2 small Flathead screwdrivers, take out the battery, and plug in the wall charger without the battery inserted. This will let you start the setup process from scratch. Make sure you go with the OFFLINE installation.Great laptop. Bought it for my sibling to game, study, and as an alternative to a chrome book.

  From my experience thus far, which is exactly 10 days (received laptop two weeks early!) I am happy with my purchase. For what I'm using it for (Playing World of Warcraft and Sims 4) it is working fine. I had a 7 year old Alienware and this is a HUGE upgrade for me. Loading speeds for games is seconds in some cases and a maybe a few minutes with others. Graphics are crisp. Sound is by Harman and I am pleasantly surprised at how it doesn't sound tin-y. It had the potential for upgrades, which was another selling point for me. I am by no means a computer expert but this machine is fitting my needs. As with any review I do for things I buy off Amazon, I will revisit this review should my opinion change.

  I ended up purchasing this laptop, because the one I had from another unnamed manf had to be sent back for warranty work.  Similar CPU, similar GPU.  This one is way quieter and the ports in back are amazing.  The screens are about the same, very sharp.  If I had one negative, it would be the battery length.  This is the smaller of the battery options and on heavy graphics programs, I am only getting about 1.5 hours of gaming on a charge.  I really don't game on the go per-sei, so this hasn't been an issue for me.  Would I buy it again.. yes yes yes

  This is a great little budget level gaming laptop. It can run everything I play at highest settings (haven't tried the newest AAA titles or anything). No problems with overheating on either the CPU or GPU. Upgrading the ram and putting in a second M2 SSD was pretty easy but had to do a google search to locate them as they're hidden under a heat shield and 2.5"" SSD bay respectively. Absolutely thrilled with the performance vs price balance with this machine.

  You can stop looking. This is the best bang for your buck laptop you can buy. Add another 8gb to make it 16gb total and it'll stand next to damn near any desktop PC. If this is going to be a daily driver, gaming 3-??hrs a day, invest in a laptop cooler. The screen isn't 144hz, big deal, get an external monitor and game like a man. The reviews kinda dog the screen wayyy more than necessary, but that is mostly for  photo/vid editor types, and if that's what you're after buy a Mac. Yet, the screen is still good enough on the go, but like I said, if you're gaming buy an external monitor. It's a great investment and it's portable. glhf

  I tried several other gaming laptops before settling on this one simply because it shines in areas that count.  It doesn't have RGB keyboard, but is backlit and that is all that really matters.  The screen is not the very best, but it's good.  The most important thing is that it runs very cool and quiet even when the GPU is stressed.  Whatever Lenovo did for thermal management in this is a clear winner.  The next closest competitor in this area was the ASUS TUF gaming laptop which was also pretty quiet, but not as good as this Lenovo.  Battery life is average, but most of the time it will be plugged in while in use so that is not that big of a deal.  Overall, having the GTX 1660 Ti on board makes this an excellent value.

  When I received the laptop all was working properly, I was very happy with the performance, however I realized that if I unplug the AC power the laptop just shut down. Lenovo vantage shows that the battery(indicator shows 97% of charge)  is broken and request a replacement. So bad for a brand new gaming laptop computer, I haven't set up any games yet, I am using it just for college.

  I use an earlier model at work, and it performs great. So when I needed a computer that can handle multiple open windows and watching videos, I decided to get this one. It is light, which makes carrying it easy and has a great screen and touch pad (which I don't usually like). My only complaint (which is minor) is the ethernet outlet and HDMI outlet are on opposite sides of the computer, just makes it easier when I plug my laptop into my internet and 2nd screen in my home office.

  Horrible battery life. Not nearly as long as advertised. You only get 3 or 4 hours out of a charge and it loses 15% overnight when hibernating. The touchpad is awful and too frequently does not work. It randomly stop recognizing any touch input and the cursor will also randomly flicker and jump around the screen. Left button on the touchpad sticks often which causes lots of problems. Wifi range is bad. This computer looks great when looking at the specs but when using it does not work well. I have had this for 3 months so waited to see if any of these problems would be fixed or improve with use and updates but nothing has changed.

  I loathe this machine. I bought it  on the recommendation of a computer tech who did not listen to what I needed. This machine is beyond stripped down, offering an odd selection of ports.  It needs so many peripherals that it looks like a momma possum with a passle of babies attached to her. This laptop quickly becomes mired to a desktop, and the necessary attachments substantially add to the price and lack of portability while in use, not to mention the array you have to carry with you if you want to do more than type a document. If you do anything with SD cards, images, sound-- this is a huge waste of time and money. But hey, the battery is hearty.

They are too flat for my fingers to feel them properly. I simply attached a wireless keyboard.There's only one conventional USB port and two Thunderbolt ports (Type C connector). One of those Thunderbolt ports is the charging port. That could be an issue for some users.The fingerprint reader has been hit and miss for me but that's true on the phone I have as well.I don't regret buying this computer.

  This laptop is amazing. It‚Äôs ultra portable, ultra thin, and ultra capable. I picked mine up to get a new laptop for school, previously I was using a bulky light gaming laptop. This is miles better for simple multitasking and even light photo editing and light games like League or Minecraft. The battery life is excellent when using it for schoolwork, the feel of the laptop is sturdy. If you need a great mini work station for work or for school that‚Äôs light and thin and doesn‚Äôt weigh you down, look no further.

  Within 2 weeks. The machine would not power up. Went on youtube and found this to be common amongst all Lenovo laptops. None of the troubleshooting tips worked. Had to take it to a tech. Yeah, thanks Lenovo for the extra money spent, that I should have spent on a better machine.

  I bought this laptop so I could work at places other than my office. My more device-savvy kid picked the laptop and the specs, so if you‚Äôre looking for a technical review, this isn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm running Office in whatever version they‚Äôre calling it these days. 365? My bread & butter is running QuickBooks Desktop (QBDT) and that program can be a bit of a resource hog. My new ThinPad has handled it beautifully. I liked that I could add the Lenovo app and customize my settings even more than what windows offers. This laptop is super light and thin - she‚Äôs practically a supermodel. I love that I can toggle a slide and a red dot shows me the camera is closed. The slide is a little hard to see because it‚Äôs black in black so I took a metallic silver sharpie and marked it. Problem solved. I like the feel of the 10-key, but I have smaller hands. Someone with larger hands might not find it roomy enough. The matte surface is pretty, but it definitely shows fingerprints. I was cleaning the cover pretty much daily. That got old quick so I got a cute skin. Always a work around.  Keep in mind, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm an end user and I think this laptop  will do nicely. When the box arrived the charger was missing. I immediately emailed the seller and they sent one right out. Mistakes happen, but they were very responsive.

  Bought this computer for personal use, No Gaming, No Video watching, Just for internet access, occasional Word and Excel use.  Within the first hour of use, I got an error message "" Critical Process Died"" message, and everything froze up.  Had to turn the computer off and restart which cleared the message and allowed me to use it again.  Now I can't run for more than an hour without it CRASHING again and again with the same error message.  After searching the web for user blogs, I found that this problem has been around for years with Lenovo products.  I am returning this Lenovo Thinkpad E15, but come to find out I will be charged a 20% restocking fee for something that hasn't worked properly out of the box.  What a SCAM industry, BUYER BEWARE!!!!!

  This laptop is all it's cracked up to be. I'm using it primarily for recording multitrack audio. That takes power and memory. The E15 has both. So far it's just what I was looking for.

  My order arrived on time and was undamaged.  Great purchase, had no issues with upgrades or connection to wifi. I was able to immediately use the Thinkpad, missing the longer battery life. The computer starts quickly and was able to download 57MB in a few minutes.  Note it's a bit older so not an intel Core i7 or fingerprint unlock functionality.  Otherwise, it's a pretty decent purchase for business computer.

  I got this computer specifically for the keyboard.  4 months into it, the bracket breaks on my ""k"" key.  It's under waranty, so Lenovo will fix it, but it will take 3+ weeks and I won't be able to wor.  I can't get a loaner, because I didn't purchase the laptop directly from Lenovo, so I have no way to mae a claim.  It's pretty frustrating.  Outside of an obscenely long repair job from the manufacturer, the seller who purchased it (Issaquah Highlands Tech) from Lenovo is washing their hands because it lasted more than a month (lol) which is the minimum that amazon requires (lol).  So I would avoid using this seller, and I would advise considering buying directly from the manufacturer purchases like these.  This is my second Lenovo, the first being a Yoga 910 that lasted many years.  The eyboard on this one lasted 4 months, and that's specifically why I got it.  Pretty frustrating to say the least.Also, the camera is very low quality, the screen is not very bright at certain angles, and while the layout of the keys is very nice, the quality of the eyboard is questionable at best.  If I could do it over, I would definitely not have chosen this computer or this seller.

  I purchased (& paid more) for the Thinkpad mainly for it's keyboard. Silly, I know, but many laptops have horrible flat keys. I LOVE my Thinkpad!! I was extra impressed it didn't come with all the extra trial software you get when you pick one up at a big box retailer!

  I am VERY disappointed especially for the money. I mainly got this to work with my pictures at the same time I upgraded my camera. I only got this laptop was because my computer tech son did the research for me and suggested it. I have only used it 3 or 4 times in the last month since 1) my youngest son can not participate in sports right now due to COVID and 2) COVID in general.I just went to use it to look up some stuff really quick and the entire top row of letters aren‚Äôt working!!! NONE of them! Nothing has been spilled on it, it has stayed safe and sound in a drawer on my desk except for the couple of times I‚Äôve used it.I‚Äôm not a happy camper with this purchase

  The unit I received (16GB RAM, 512 GB NVME SSD) was unable to wake up after going to sleep due to idle. If you use the [Start]->Power->Sleep menu option in Win10, it was able to wake up. This was also a 1st gen E15, not the latest 2nd Gen E15 that is widely available. The SSD was an aftermarket brand ""OEM Genuine"" with what appears to be a solid Silicon Motion controller. Otherwise the keyboard was comfortable and the design looks and feels sharp. I am just very disappointed with the inability to wake up from sleep - and I wonder if this has anything to do with the aftermarket upgrades.

  As other online reviews have pointed out, the sound is AMAZING, the keyboard and trackpad are wonderful, the build quality is excellent, and the port selection is solid.Some of those same reviews pointed out how the screen is dim. However, I was shocked and disappointed by just how dim it really was. I wasn't expecting it to be the greatest, but in my view it is actually bad. And to make matters worse, it seemed like the screen was poorly calibrated out of the box, leading to pretty bad white balance. For me, this screen is completely unacceptable for a full day's worth of work.- I constantly found myself reaching for the button to try and increase the screen brightness, only to be frustrated that I'd maxed it out already.- The dim light and off coloring was actually giving me headaches.- My 2011 Macbook Air (which I bought this to replace, isn't even 1080p, and is on the fritz), is still brighter and more color accurate than this computer.Because of this, I returned my laptop after only 2 or 3 days. It's really a shame that I hated the screen so much. The rest of the computer was a joy to use.

  I enjoyed using this machine for about a month before it slipped from my fingers and dropped on the floor from about 1 m.  It landed on the corner near the power switch which dented the case and the hinge and cracked the screen.  I was surprised the case was designed to be so vulnerable to what should have been a minor event. Contributing to its vulnerability are its slick surfaces the sharp angles of the case.  Makes day-to-day handling a bit dicey and is prone to slip from your fingers. So, while the inner workings of the computer seemed very nice and functional while it was whole, I am now faced with purchasing another notebook.

  at volume 60% and up sound starts to cause the case to vibrate producing annoying noise. Its weird given that its aluminum. I will return this soon if I cant find a way to fix it.

  I have had this laptop (purchased from this seller) for almost five months and I love it! I got it for school and art, I use the touchscreen and a wacom bamboo ink plus pen for digital art, and the touch and pressure sensitivity is incredible! This laptop is compatible with Adobe Fresco (digital art software not available on every computer) and can easily run Fresco, Photoshop, Illustrator, a browser, word, and Spotify all at the same time. The screen brightness is fantastic and the backlit keyboard has two settings which is very nice. The included pen isn't super great, mostly due to the small size, but it does work well in a pinch and responds to different pressure settings. The speakers are super powerful and clear, I wasn't super excited about the glass exterior but I think it looks very sleek it doesn't make the laptop heavy. I can't say enough about how great this laptop is!

  I purchased this Yoga C930-12IKB.  The use was very limited.  Usually used while in bed and I woke up and wanted to search for something and my phone would not be the best way to search.  Anyway, after 14 months the laptop was left on during the night and streaming a youtube video playlist while I slept.  When I woke up the display was dead.  I hooked up an external monitor to the machine, works fine.  I called Lenovo and explained all this.  Of course after a year they will do nothing.  On February 24, 2020 I purchased this $1,139.67 laptop.  I have been using and purchasing computers personally and in my business since 1995.  This was absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made.

  This Windows notebook with its SSD drive powers up faster than my cell phone or android tablet; it is about the same as a chrome book with a SSD drive.  The build quality is equal to or better than any previously owned HP or Toshiba laptop, but maybe not quite as good as an older Sony Vaio Windows XP laptop (when Sony made them - not when the cheapest bidder made them).  The Wi-Fi is fast and uses both 2.4 and 5 bands from my router.  It seems to operate longer on battery power than a new chrome book, but I've not actually tested them under the same conditions (Wi-Fi, screen brightness, etc.).

  The product works fine. It‚Äôs just that the base is not level as you can see in the picture! The bottom right corner sticks up, so it‚Äôs super annoying every time I put my hand on the keyboard.

  Very very powerful Intel 10th Gen Core i7 machine. Great value for the money on a 2020 computer which started production only around June 2020. I wanted a desktop replacement which is somewhat portable and this was it. I upgraded the memory to 16 GB. There's only one slot, so took out the 8 GB and put in 16 GB. Highly recommend the memory upgrade, there are YouTube videos on how but I recommend using a nearby tech professional since laptops these days are highly integrated. My only concern before buying was the display but it turned out to be pretty good. Attached a picture of my ThinkPad on the left and MacBook on the right for display comparison. I run video editing software, CAD software, coding software, everything runs very smooth and quiet. When you place this laptop on a flat surface you'll see that the back is very slightly (1 mm) elevated, this is by design to allow for air flow cooling. All in all, love this Thinkpad, highly recommend.

Y ademas parece que esta garantia es solo valida en algunos paises asi√°ticos.... Todo deja pensar que esta laptop viene de un pais extranjero y que es revendida....O que fue reacondicionada, pero esto no aparece en el aviso de venta.Es al limite una estafa...!!!Ademas existe un problema con la laptop, cuando se conecta a la corriente para recargarla uno tiene electricidad que se siente en toda la maquina.La maquina esta ahora fuera de estados unidos ya que la lleve conmigo sino la hubiera devuelto enseguida.... No se que hacer, pero el vendedor deberia ser denunciado.

  I've just been using my Lenovo C940 for a few days now. So far, I love how comfortable typing on the keyboard feels and its colors are amazing. On the downside, I would've rathered the slots to be on both sides of the laptop rather than all being crammed on one side! It has one USB C slot, one USB 3.0 slot and one 3.5 mm slot (for headphones), all placed on the left side, in addition to the charging slot! Nothing on the right side except for the power button! It would've been more convenient if they were distributed on both sides, and more of them would've been nice too. I had to buy an external hub to get all the slots I need operating at one time - but I guess that's the case with all laptops now, although I really don't understand why! Also, for just one time so far, the fan was a bit loud and the left side palm rest area was a bit warmer than usual. I also noticed that the outer casing stains a bit.

  First, the positives. Lenovo makes attractive products at decent price points. That's where the good news ends. Reliability is sketchy, and customer service is nothing short of hellish. I have owned two Lenovo tablets (Tab) and two laptops (Yoga and ThinkPad). The tablets have worked fine, the laptops not so much. Both laptops have required (warranty) repairs. My experience with my Yoga 920 (since replaced at Lenovo's expense by a Yoga C940) have been the worst of my entire life, and I am over 50 years old so that is saying something. The 920 required three motherboard replacements due to persistent issues with the touchpad consistently failing. Finally, after the 3rd replacement failed, Lenovo admitted that it was a design issue and shipped me a replacement Yoga C940. Getting this done required a total of probably 25+ hours on the phone with tech support and/or customers service over the course of 12 months, and escalation to multiple customer service managers. At this point, I was just happy to get a replacement. Unfortunately, after 4 months with the new Yoga C940 I ran into the (known and persistent Lenovo) issue whereby a system update triggers Bitlocker issues and the unit cannot be rebooted or reimaged. Although I had paid for at-home service and a 3-year extended warranty, Lenovo used the COVID pandemic as an excuse to require me to send the unit in to their national repair depot. That was five weeks ago, and it is now in a black hole. I have FedEx tracking confirming that the unit was received by Lenovo. However, the online tracking functionality for repairs has been inoperable for over a month now. Crazy that one of the largest PC companies in the world cannot maintain a functioning online repair tracking system; this should tell you something. I have put in over 10 calls to customer service. They initially started out by telling me that the unit would be repaired and turned around within a maximum of nine business days. After this deadline passed, they were out of excuses so started telling me that they did not have the ability (even on their end) to get updates on my unit because they were having system problems. I requested that they call the repair depot for an update (seems simple, right?); they assured me that they would do so and get back to me within 24 hours. Did not happen. As an aside, two separate customer service managers made this same promise to me (would get an update and call me back within 24 hours) and neither had even the basic courtesy to return the call as promised. A 3rd customer service manager told me that my case had been escalated to a customer relationship manager, and that a new unit had been ordered for replacement. When I asked for some confirmation of this via email, they told me that confirmation had already been sent but, surprise surprise, it had been sent to an incorrect email address (the correct email address, but with a single letter misspelled). This was a lie. I tested the ""incorrect"" email address they claimed to have used, and it immediately sent back a response that no such email address exists. I have left multiple messages with my ""assigned"" customer relationship manager, none of which has been returned. The bottom line is that for the better part of 18 months, I have had a complete dud of a laptop. This unit originally cost me over $1,000. I purchased an extended warranty with at-home repair service. I have spent probably 50 hours on the phone dealing with customer service (between the two Yoga units). The responses have been incompetent, and often downright rude. This is no way to treat customers. Lenovo should be ashamed.

  It seems to check off all the good boxes for a laptop as a 2 in 1 with 4k definition and good speakers.  Sadly, the battery life is horrible--about 4 hours--which is how long it takes to charge, a very long time for a battery this small.  There is a pen built into the laptop but it's small with a very poor battery life.  And if you try to get another stylus on here, almost none work.  How poorly designed.Worst of all is Lenovo's service, or I should say lack thereof.  Called up support, and it tells you they are backed up with calls so go online to setup an appt for a return phone call.  What?  That is okay.  I will save them the time, and return this computer.  The combination of a poorly made product with zero customer service is not a pill most people will swallow.

  I've been researching laptops for months and finally found this C940.  Was looking for a nice multi-function machine for general use.This one seemed to check all of the boxes for me - touchscreen, good battery life, nicely constructed with solid materials, USB-C (somewhat futureproof), bright screen, good screen size at 14'', etc..As a bonus, the speakers are the loudest and most full-sounding speakers I've encountered on a laptop, and its a great design that the soundbar points right at you when using it normally and also swivels around when you rotate to tablet/tent mode - compared to the lenovo flex 5 which had the speakers on the bottom so it always sounded muffled.Everyone picks up the c940 and comments about how solid and nice it feels - no flexing when holding it on the corners at all.  Also the included stylus pen is awesome and tucks away nicely into this slot on the backside.I had hoped for an AMD processor, but I got an amazing deal on this I7-10th gen version at Best Buy so I had to get it.So far so good.  No complaints.Edited to say that the battery life has been fine (usually running spotify, firefox with 15+ tabs, a few other non-taxing applications) and that it charges pretty quick. Also being able to charge through USB-C is huge.

  Wow, bought the used like new and I'm impressed.  No scratches,,looked new.  Could not tell it was ever used until i registered at lenovo and saw it had 4 months left on warranty. loving it.  I like gaming machines because they do well with graphic designs, art work etc. This has an adult,  professional look.  But power under the hood so to speak.  I've only had it a few days. I updated bios and some drivers at lenovo.  Ran some tests.  Clocked at 4.5 today.  Love that most of the ports are on the back edge, out of the way.  And thanks to seller (uShopMall) one the one day shipping!  Haven't opened it up yet,  but it have spots for 2 sticks ram.  The motherboard has a bracket and.

  Great packaging, nice box with foam inserts and plenty of protection. Cloth screen protector is nice, can slide it in before closing the lid, has a cloth cover for the laptop as well.Laptop is well constructed, feels super sturdy. Nice rubber feet grips the table. Lid is easy to open, can use one finger no problem.Keys are super responsive and remind me of MacBook Pro keys when typing which, for me, is a plus; as they are the most comfortable and smooth to type on, again for me.Track pad has no issues, responsive to all button presses and gestures.Setup is nice and easy, not much bloatware. This is easily removed.Performance wise, flawless so far. Screen is nice and bright, good, rich colors watching tv or in games. The fan Isn‚Äôt super loud, although it hasn‚Äôt kicked into maximum yet gaming. I haven‚Äôt played any super intensive games yet to test out graphic capabilities, but if you watch On YouTube ‚ÄúJarrods Tech‚Äù benchmark videos, this laptop handles everything with ease. I have been playing satisfactory though on ultra, and it‚Äôs awesome.I can run multiple YouTube videos, coding software, multiple instances of a few other games I play and more with no problem.Battery life is atrocious, but it‚Äôs a gaming laptop so that‚Äôs expected. If you want better battery life, buy one online and install it, super simple. Otherwise, unplugged you'll get 2-3 hours depending on workload.All in all it‚Äôs a great budget gaming laptop. I researched every laptop within the $500-2000 range and honestly you‚Äôre getting minor performance increases the more money you spend. The only drawback this has for serious gamers is the hard drive. May need to buy an external drive with more memory, always go with an SSD.

  I recently bought this laptop, for work and videogames it's really good, the gpu it's enough to run every game and I would say it's perfect with the exception of two things, at least in my laptop the touchpad doesn't work at all, I tried to fix it but any of the solutions work, and the second thing  it's the overheating, which I say it's fault of the proper Lenovo, the refrigerate system it's just not enough so you can expect temperatures above 176¬∞F and even 194¬∞F in both cpu and gpu and that it's just not good for the health of any computer.Also have in mind that high temperatures are normal in gaming harware specially in laptops but this temperatures are really high, my recommendation is to turn off the turbo boosting of the cpu, -just search this in Google- after this you can run every game in 60fps and good quality and the temperatures won't pass the 158¬∞F. -also you can buy a cooling pad-So yeah, ignoring this problem, and the malfunctioning touchpad that it's probably just bad luck in my case, so far this laptop is very good and recomendable.

  I bought this PC mainly because it was not updated as many of this model are. I wanted an unopened unit that had a factory warranty and was not opened up by self-described ""experts"". Obviously I paid a premium price but  I was also in a hurry. The laptop performs flawlessly and instead of repeating the same stuff all other reviewers wrote I have some issues I haven't seen anyone else address. The main issue is the optional ethernet extension cable which I also purchased, it works well but blocks the usb -C (Thunderbolt) port. You cannot use them at the same time, it appears to be an intentional design issue. I don't know what one has to do with the other but since I have some Wi-Fi weak spots in my house I use ethernet for large file transfers or backups. The pc has 4 usb ports, 2 type A and 2 type C, one C is used for the charge power cord but will work as usb if the power cord isn't plugged in, one type A I have a mouse receiver that leaves 1 type C which is blocked if you use the ethernet adapter and one type A free. Don't know if this matters to anyone else but I think it is worth mentioning. I do like it very much, fast, light and stable.

Given I had spent over $1200 for this laptop and was struggling to make it operable, I feel that is egregious customer treatment.

  My last couple laptops have been Lenovos, so when I was ready to buy a new one, I thought I'd check out the newer models. I wound up purchasing this one about a month ago, and I'm very happy with it so far. It's lightweight, it's fast, great memory and storage capacity, and the touchscreen is a bonus. HDMI port works with my external monitor, and it has 2 standard USB ports so I can keep my mouse/keyboard dongle plugged in, and use a charger or flash in the other. Also has a USB-C port and photo card slot. Good battery life, charges quickly. The speakers are good; I can actually watch a movie on this without an external speaker, which was tough with my previous laptop. Lenovos are good machines, and this is a good Lenovo!

  The computer is very fast and I am able to download items in almost half the time compared to my desktop. It has a very large screen that is much larger than my old laptop. I am impressed at how many apps are available to download and how fast it is when loading. I did not give it a full 5 star review because some apps and browsers are difficult to navigate through. I had trouble finding the apps I need, but when I did find them, they were easy to use. I also think the computer should have come with more instructions on how to use it and the stylus pen that comes with it. It only came with a brief guide of how to set it up and what the different buttons do, but I think there should be more instruction on how to navigate the software. Overall, I am LOVING this computer, and if you are a tech savvy person, this is the perfect companion for you.

  This computer is awesome. It serves my purposes each and every day. Not disappointed in it at all. The only problem I've run into is the 2 hr battery life. So, I just keep it plugged in.

  I will not buy another Lenovo laptop. This is supposed to be one of their ""Flagship"" series that is a good quality build. This computer has failed after 1 year of normal use. The battery will not hold a charge and it has to remain plugged in to work. I guess that is how Lenovo expects an $1100 laptop to perform. This turned out to be a waste of money. PS the fingerprint reader hasn't worked right since day 1.Real great work Lenovo. You really know how to overcharge for a terrible product.

  I purchased this laptop as it had great reviews overall and good recommendations.  Generally, I don't regret it but it seems like I got one that came with problems.  Just had it for two days and already the camera and the fingerprint scanner are not working.  Called Lenovo and they are sending a technician to replace these (luckily, I purchased the extended warranty) otherwise, I would have had to ship it to them and be without a laptop.  However, as for everything else,  I love it.  Works well and fast for what I do (mostly, web search, finances, checking emails, etc).  The design is nice and sleek.  The keyboard takes getting used to as I'm used to a full-size keyboard,  but it does feel well.The packaging was nice, came in a box within a box and a nice temporary sleeve, So it was well protected.I added a USB-C adapter (with USB ports, HDMI port, card reader, and network connection) to connect it directly to my network and add other peripherals and it connected quickly without issues. I connected an external monitor as well and it connected quickly. The speaker sound is decent, maybe not enough for those who want professional-grade audio, but well enough for the occasional movie or music.  The track mouse is large and comfortable.  Like many other reviews, the one drawback is not having more connections; at least one more on the right side to allow freedom to connect power from either side.  And once you use one for the power then you are left with only one USB-C for everything else.On the USB 3 Port, I added an external USB extender that adds 4 more USB ports so that helps.  Finally not having an integrated card reader also limits somewhat for transferring files, especially if you don't have internet access.  Luckily my USB-C adapter came with a card reader.Finally, the screen is nice and bright. Again, maybe not as bright for those who work on professional graphics, but does very well for the general use.  I haven't tried it in sunlight, but I assume it would be similar to some smartphones, where it would be somewhat not as clear as indoors, but I don't use it outdoors so that is a non-issue for me.Update: the customer service is one of the worst I've ever had. Tech came in and fixed fingerprint but forgot camera. Had to pry open screen as it's glued, so had to re-order camera and a new screen. 2nd tech came a few days later and installed camera and screen but couldn't get it to work. He called their tech support and kept getting nowhere. Spent nearly 2 hours between tech support, sales, and customer service. He had to leave as he had another appointment. So I continued the saga and spent nearly three hours back and forth as well. Customer service stated that they had noted the issue and transferred me to Tech for them to tell me that I had to go to sales for a replacement, and they in turn sent me back to customer service. It was extremely frustrating. So I ended up having to return it. I called them again to get a refund on my extended warranty, they said they prossesed it but I never got it. I gave up. Seems they need it more than I do.Kept a 2 star as the laptop itself is nice if you want one just for looks.

  I'll update if we have trouble but so far it seems very well made with great sound (for a laptop). Nice screen and we aren't noticing to much glare/reflections in our use, which was something several YouTube reviewers had mentioned. Good color and brightness. Got the 12GB/512GB model but shared out our music, photos, etc. on the home PC and it works well. And the home desktop has a 1TB drive that we can use for extra storage to avoid filling up the laptop SSD.

  The body and weight of the laptop were great.The laptop itself arrived without windows 10 ( no big deal, ordered it to install it). The laptop also did not have the drivers to install windows 10. After hours online with Lenovo it was determined that the hard drive was defective.I ordered this laptop because I needed it for class by Thursday. The inability to use it causes a lot of headaches and I won‚Äôt order another thing from this supplier.

  I wish I loved this laptop more... it's lightweight, sleek... but the connectivity issues are unbearable. Not only does the connection drop every 10-15 minutes or so, but it messes with other devices connected to the internet! It seems to be an issue with this model? I'll be switching back to Macbook... much more reliable.

  This experience has been great so far. My laptop arrived quickly. Set up was simple. This is my first Lenovo and so far it has exceeded my expectations and one the best laptops I have had. I especially like the keyboard; it is very comfortable to use. Only feature not a 5 is the display which seems faded and murky but I am accustomed to using gaming laptops so that may account for it. So far, so good. I have had it for 2 weeks.

  I just received this computer and it is garbage.  I couldn‚Äôt even get it set up before it encountered an error and had to restart.  After it restarted it ran for about three minutes and ran into another error and restarted.  As of now, I‚Äôve had it on for about 15 minutes and it has run into errors and restarted four times.  I thought Apple was the worst computer I‚Äôd ever known but, now I‚Äôm missing the days when I had an Apple computer that only froze up occasionally.

  Just bought this laptop. Everything seems to be working properly except the fingerprint scanner.After many hours, I have tried everything (activated the bitlocker, made sure the BIOS security chip was active, etc.) but the Windows system still cannot ""find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Finger"".I wish the support team could provide some assistance to make this work. This was the primary feature I that made me choose this laptop over other laptops and it doesn't work.

  I had an HP Pavillion previously which was ok, but this ThinkPad has 2 times the battery life (about 6 hrs.) with steady use, more with light use. I have a blog and write a LOT!! The keyboard is much much better than any laptop I have ever owned. The keys are ""cupped"" just enough and are perfectly responsive for me. The screen is easier to see because there is no glare and the colors are vibrant. As you can tell, I love it!!

  This is, what I would describe as, a lower-end ThinkPad that was ""hopped-Up"" between Mfg and the retail sales end.That may sound not so good.  But, the result - as far as I am concerned - is a darn good computer.  I can tell you that it is the fastest computer (8-total) that I have in the house.I was able to immediately dump MS Windows and install Linux easily - not something done easily on all laptops.The price, for me, was in the ballpark, and I am happy with the purchase!

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with 10 tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The volume rocker on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.

  Beware this seller.  Seller clearly states this is a 4K screen.  It is not.  1080 is the max resolution.  We will see if they try to charge 20% for the returned items.  Clearly - deceptive at best, and possibly fraudulent.

  I could not be more happier with a laptop than I am with this one. In the past I have had Surface Pro's, Acer's, Chromebooks, and Dell's. While each one of those has something special about them, this one is above and beyond. It is sleek, smooth and stylish. The hinge is tight, yet not loose. The sound bar is great and is in a perfect position as it's not on the bottom, front, or side of the laptop like most. The keyboard is the best I have typed on for a laptop. The track pad, well it's a track pad. The touchscreen is accurate and responsive. The three USB's (1 - 3.0 & 2 - USB-C) is really nice. However, I believe it'd be nice to have another USB 3.0 on the right side of the laptop. Not at all a deal breaker. The battery has a pretty good life. The few times I have run it down, it's lasted 10-12 hours. That's all dependent on use and screen brightness. I usually keep my brightness on 25% and is still bright enough to see. Every once in a while, heavy use, the fan will spin up. It's not terribly loud, but noticeable. It has a stylus pen, but I do not use it. Also, it is lightweight and travels nicely. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a sleek, lightweight, beefy laptop. I mean, an i7 and 16GB or RAM. It can do pretty much anything you want it to do. For the price compared to other machines, this is a deal.

  Great laptop, able to do video editing on it and quiet under load. Sound is superior to other ultras and fit and finnish is top notch. 4K screen is gorgeous but be aware if you have brightness in the 70s or higher, expect 3 hours of battery under continuous use.  Pre sale support was spot on and unit arrived factory sealed and works great. The USB A port has already shown that it is still a must have in the business place. A winner.

  Went online to check register and check the warranty. Turns out warranty was active since 2020. Basically out of a 1 year factory warranty I have 3 months. So I can only assume that this is a USED LAPTOP. Buyer beware. Had to spend $35 on an extended warranty and probably another $25 on a replacement battery warranty. BUYER BEWARE.

  Tremendous performance at a very reasonable price. This laptop is now the most powerful computer in my house, beating out a desktop I custom built a few months ago, for a similar price. The only room for improvement is the SSD but that is an easy field upgrade. The 144hz display on the Lenovo Legion 5 is bright and clear. If you have been gaming on a 60hz display, you will appreciate the smoother action that 144hz provides.Keyboard feels great to me. The power supply is a beefy 230 watts.

  This computer was clearly opened. The indicator sticker was covered with a black sticker. There are what looked like cigarette ashes across the top and inside the laptop. The plastic sleeve was not replaced correctly and the glue was stuck to the cover. There are fingerprints on the mouse buttons. I should have read the reviews, especially the one that alleges that this company swapped out the hardware on his.

  I am a casual gamer that is fine with playing at low/medium settings on games. That being said the bulk of my time spent on a computer is school or work related.  However, biggest pet peeves is being bogged down doing somewhat simple task, work/school related or simple casual gaming. For the money, albeit it has good longevity, this was a fantastic value for power. A powerful processor and 16gb of ram for this cost is around $500 more with many other laptops, not to mention if they are not business class theyve got some tacky RGB setup that only a 40 year old virgin in their moms basement would love. To me the 1660 Ti was just a nice touch for the other components I wanted the power at, not to mention the TB harddrive and 512GB. There is an optional hybrid mode where you can enable the UHD graphics chip for everything but games, at which point the dedicated card will switch on. Improves the battery life and temps when doing everything else but gaming. I also under-volted the CPU, for my uses even for games has not been a problem, and improves battery life/lower temps.Looks like they raised the price but its been great so far. Only complaint is that the whole case is plastic, and the camera on the bottom, not to mention the quality on the camera inst the best, the rest of the computer considered is disappointing

  Purchased for graduate school and some light gaming. As a gaming machine I would rate it as just... ok. However, I had this for less than a year and have had semi-regular issues with blue screen crashes even after doing a full manufacturer's reset. Today it completely died. Full battery, plugged in, and it just powered down and would not turn back on again. Totally dead.While I'm sure this will not happen to everyone, I doubt I'll be giving my business to Lenovo again in the future.

  It arrived very quickly after ordering. The laptop is as expected and was well packaged and protected. It's still early days using my Lenovo, but so far it meets all my expectations. It's responsive, the SSD works well, and the design is slick and pleasant to look at.

  First a disclaimer, I am not much of a PC gamer. From what I can gather this Legion laptop would make an OK gaming laptop.  The GPU, which is most important for gaming, is adequate.  The CPU is much more than adequate, and the display is beautiful.  My biggest concern would be that it comes with only a 500 GB SSD.  The SSD is nice and fast, but just a copy of the free-to-play version of Destiny 2 is 83 GB which is over 17% of the 475 GB of usable disk.  Destiny 2 runs beautifully on it, btw.  I usually play on PS/4 and Xbox, so I got frustrated with using the keyboard and mouse pretty fast. Luckily you can plug in an Xbox controller over USB and it plays just like the console.  I think this would work over Bluetooth also and with a PS/4 controller.  The only disadvantage is that you get keyboard hints for controls so need be familiar with using the controller on the console version.There are a couple of other things to be aware of.  There is no Windows Hello compatible camera, so no face recognition, and the camera is placed under the screen, so you get that flattering up-the-nose shot during video conferencing. No fingerprint reader or other biometrics either.  There is no touch screen, which I understand is normal for gaming laptops.  And the battery life is‚Ä¶, well, if you‚Äôre going to be gaming, you‚Äôre going to be plugged in. It‚Äôs also a pretty heavy laptop, especially with the power supply brick, which is huge.There are some pleasant surprises though.  The keyboard can be backlit and it has a very good feel to it.  A pro and con is that there is a number pad on the right, which centers the regular keyboard over to the left.  The touchpad area is shifted left, centered under the keyboard.  This took some getting used to, but if your use included a lot of number keying I imagine it would be pretty nice to have the keypad.  In fact, with the keyboard, CPU power, fast SSD and crisp display I‚Äôll bet this would be a great machine for anyone that lives in spreadsheets all day.  Another nice surprise was the built-in Ethernet port; no need for an adapter!I‚Äôm going to be using this laptop for software development, so I did some benchmarks building the eShopOnContainers project you can find on GitHub.  It‚Äôs a fairly large solution with dozens of projects. I first did an initial dotnet build to fetch all dependencies and then a dotnet clean, so there would be some actual building to do, and then a timed dotnet build. The Legion completed the build in around 15 seconds each time. For comparison I did the same process on my work laptop, which is a Dell Precision 5530 with an eighth gen i7-8850 running at 2.6 GHz, 32 GB of RAM and an SSD.  Both machines have 6 multithreaded cores for a total of 12 CPUs.  The Dell took anywhere from 18 ‚Äì 24 seconds to do the build.  To be fair, the Dell is an enterprise machine with all sorts of ‚Äòstuff‚Äô running on it to keep us safe. So the Legion is going to be a sweet dev box.  It also feels snappier and smoother overall.

  I am not a computer geek so I was extremely happy with this thing setting itself up.  All I had to do was hit ‚Äúnext‚Äù.  Nothing upsets me more than my having to be smarter than the machine as far as set up.  The processing is very fast and the graphics are beautiful.  There are numerous different styles of ports on this thing so you could hook up a lot of different peripheral devices like Hubs, external drives, scanner, or even a mouse if you are still stuck in the twentieth century (like me).  The processing speed is more than adequate for gaming but the hard drive may fill up quickly.  It is a bit heavier than I would have expected and the power supply is rather big too. This laptop would be great for gaming, school or business, and I highly recommend it.

  If you are getting this for under $1100, just go for it!!!I did not buy this for gaming, I actually bought this for productivity and the specs definitely screamed productivity to me. I have used it only for a few months now and I love it so far. Windows boots up super fast and I almost want to ditch my Mac (I have been on Mac for 8 years now). They keyboard has a great feel to it and the screen is big enough that I don‚Äôt need an external monitor for most of my work. It doesn‚Äôt tire your eyes after long use either. Love it, will recommend it as a gift as well, especially to students.

  The laptop is preeeetty good. I can finally play the Witcher 3 + I finally got to see max settings on League for the first time üòÇüòÇ. The laptop is near silent while I browse on chrome with ~20 tabs loaded with youtube videos and only started to vent when I played really intense games like Monster Hunter or other games that required a few GB dedicated graphics memory. The numpad is right above the arrow keys and the home/pgup/etc buttons can only be used with the function button, but this isn't a problem if you use an external keyboard like I do. The screen can also fold all the way back, awesome for watching movies in bed or somewhere comfortable. Most of the usb and charger ports are in the back of the laptop as well, although there are additional usb ports on the left and right sides. The delivery was also quick and easy - it came in ~ a week and they also had me sign to ensure it wouldn't be left on the porch abd get stolen. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the laptop. If you're looking more into this model, there are a few good comparisons on YouTube between this one and Lenovo or other gaming laptops.

  as of today (1/28/2020) this lab top has been one of the best one i have tested and i'm glad i bought it. However I do have a bias towards IBM/Lenovo as I have used there think pads be for from when was a kid to well now. Granted my bias has now been divided between both IBM/Lenovo and Toshiba.  However since Toshiba one hasn‚Äôt developed a gaming PC and two Lenovo has been killing it in the game pc market. As seen by this gaming lab top as it holds up pretty well to a gaming tower. Not 1 to 1 but it is a good option to consider.

  My 3rd Lenovo laptop and extremely pleased. The specs on this thing for the price blew anything else out of the water when I was searching for a laptop that can handle my RAM and processing heavy hobbies. Keyboard is just right. Responsive trackpad that I actually don't mind using. Heavy workload with no performance issues. The RAM size, SSD size, i7 cpu, graphics card, all perfect for unity game dev. Probably would be great with UE as well. Very satisfied customer.

  I‚Äôm very pleased with this laptop.  The processor is much more powerful and faster than my previous one and there is plenty of hard drive space and RAM.  It was very easy to set up and has been running very smoothly.  I don‚Äôt use it for gaming but I have an audio/visual software program that I use for work and it runs it much better than my last machine did.  It is a god size but is a bit on the heavier side.  I‚Äôd rather have the durability than have it be too flimsy though.  Lenovo is a great brand, it is all we use at my office.

  I got this thing to do primarily 3D work, involving Blender, Substance, etc. As well as some light gaming. The computer runs Substance Painter like a dream, and modded Skyrim barely breaks a sweat.The Fan gets VERY loud, I'm guessing from having such a great graphics processor but bottlenecked with a 2.8 CPU.I also was unfortunate that within only a few weeks, I've been cursed with a stuck pixel. It doesn't stand out too much, but once you notice, it can be annoying. Even more so since this laptop is so new.Overall great performance marred by a glaring stuck pixel. Said pixel shouldn't deter from great specs though.

  i'm upgrading to a modern laptop, as I have just used my phone for any web browsing.  I knew if i was going to spend any money on a computer, I would spend a little more than i wanted to make sure I got the best performance and aesthetics for the money. This computer is perfect for what I wanted. I've never owned a gaming PC before, so i don't have high expectations, I just wanted it to be on par with what my playstation can do. This computer can run Forza Horizon 4 at 128- 160 FPS, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 at 70- 100+FPS. Can't ask for much more in a cheaper gaming laptop. I'm perfectly happy. build quality is pretty good too.

  I bought this computer primarily because I needed a better Zoom device for large meetings (25-30 people). I got constant complaints about the audio and and my Zoom picture was not good either. Other people had good audio and pictures no matter what equipment they were using. This laptop was unacceptable for my application and now I will have to get an external web cam, costing me portability and money. I would return the laptop but I didn't set up the Zoom soon enough to discover this problem. I am thoroughly disgusted with Lenovo.I should add that when I complained to Lenovo they wanted me to ship the laptop to a repair facility. You know the drill...ship, wait, pay, then it comes back the same. It was made poorly and is functioning as manufactured.

  Worst lemon of a computer I‚Äôve ever had! I‚Äôve been using this computer for our small law office for just over 6 months now and I am having to reformat it for the 3rd time today!! Like clockwork I have to replace my laptop every 2 to 2-1/2 years-I just wear them out. My last 2 laptops have been ASUS-pretty sure I will be going back to an ASUS when I replace this one. And this is not a cheap computer to replace! I‚Äôm pretty good with troubleshooting issues, but this computer is next level when it comes to problems. I try all the fixes and nothing works or other problems surface when I am finally able to resolve one issue. I‚Äôve never had such a buggy, problematic computer, and I was in college when the internet was ‚Äúinvented!‚Äù So I‚Äôve been around for awhile and have used MANY computers. And of course it‚Äôs not under warranty. Grrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!

  This would be a 5 star, except for two reasons...the shift key on the right side is same size as page up, down, etc keys, and located to the far right. So, if for years your use to the shift key twice the width of other keys, then getting your right pinkie and brain wrapped around this is not easy...I regularly miss the right shift key and then have to hunt for the cursor, and sometimes, because of continued typing, have to be careful no words were changed or inserted. So for that reason, only 4 stars.Also, the computer locked up consistently, for no apparent reason. However, I finally called support and found out the solution was to remove chrome (if you use chrome) and re-install it...once I did that, the laptop works great and as fast as I need it too.

  It was hard to let my Macbook Air go (was running windows on it), but this Lenovo is amazing. Same light feel (feels thinner than the air), touch screen, 512gb SSD, and the battery refuses to die...  I would like the keyboard to be a little roomier, but that's just a few days until I get used to it. Amazing computer for sub $900.

  Before the review I'd like to point out that Amazon no longer offers any price protection. I paid $750 this computer. A few days after my purchase the price dropped to $720. I asked Amazon for a refund or credit for the difference and no luck.The computer itself is great. Thin, light, fast with a 512gb SSD. The keyboard is very nice. I understand the complaints about the small right shift key, though it doesn't affect me as I only use the left shift key. Updating the BIOS was easy using lenovo's system update utility. The build is solid and the trackpad is decent. I've had the computer for about a week and will update my review if needed. At this point I highly recommend, especially if you can pick it up for less than $750.

  I love this laptop. It's super quick to turn on and shut down. Runs programs and internet quickly with no hesitation. My only issue is the right shift key, which I did read about before purchasing. I rarely ever use the left shift, so this has been a major adjustment for me. Every time I hit the right shift I end up hitting the up arrow instead because of placement. Just know that going in. I'm satisfied with the over all speed, systems, screens, etc.

  I like so much the product. It got 1 year guarantee and almost all features that Lenovo bring to us.Is just like the description said also the 144 Hz screen is really nice to have it.The temps are a little bit high (90-94) on Performance Mode but with some tweaks it will go normal (80-90 (just on little spikes) is almost stucked on 80-85 on Performance Mode while on Quiet Mode it cant go over 80¬∫C even is almost stuck on 75¬∫C) and maybe with repasting it could improve a little too.The battery  lasts around 5-7 hours on normal load (Videos, coding) and on heavy load 3-5 hours depends on the process.The camera is down the screen so i think with a base you could use it on a easy way.I could suggest this for a first gaming laptop or just using it like a Workstation

  I've had this laptop for over a year , it has sat stationary at my desk during that whole time , I have had the charger , charge port, and power brick replaced 3 times in the the last 3 months due to failure , this laptop unplugged will last less than two hours and during that time will be insanely slow and stuttery, do not waste your money, getting support to fix a faulty product even with extra warranty's is A nightmare

  This laptop has been wonderful so far; I run the sims 4 on it successfully, which can be an issue on some computers. The graphics card is exactly what you would expect for the specs. Battery life could use improvement, but most laptops experience this; it does last a decent amount of time to get some work done; perhaps 2 or 3 hours if your programs aren't demanding a lot of processing power.

  Heck, dollar for dollar this is the GAMING rig to beat.Item of Note:There IS a 2.5‚Äù hard drive caddy/cable with this model. Also the 2nd M.2 slot does show up if you put a NVME in there (not sure about SATA m.2 as I didn‚Äôt have one to test). It is standard 80mm size, same as the main slot, and seems to have extra room above/below it so I believe something double sided would fit, as would something with a SMALL heatsink on top (like say the Adata Swordfish one).Screen:Most of the other gaming laptops in the $750-1100 range have dim ~250 nit screens with awful <50% color gamuts. This one, 300nit rated (~330 actual based on reviews) 144hz and 100% srgb. It is striking, you won‚Äôt find a screen like this in this price range elsewhere.Power:Then you have a 8c/16t 4800H processor, which netted just under 4700 on Cinebench R20 in Performance Mode. For reference, my desktop running a Ryzen 3700X 8c/16t scores between 4600 and 4800 depending on background software and performance settings.Memory:The ram is ideal, 3200mhz, 16gb, you don‚Äôt want any less because that‚Äôs the lower limit for gaming and productivity, and you don‚Äôt want any more because each 8gb is about 3watts of power consumption. Not sure if it supports 32gb, I can‚Äôt see 16gb being the limit but the Lenovo Support responders in Q&A here seem to think it is.Battery.:It would be nice if they had any prebuilt options with the 80wh version, but they don‚Äôt, and I took a star off for that. Most of us would gladly pay an extra $50+ for that option. And I don‚Äôt feel like waiting 5+ weeks (2 months? 3?) for a custom one just to get it. That being said, with proper settings this 60wh can be sufficient.*Quiet Mode (fn+q until power led turns blue)*Battery Save mode on (click on battery icon, slide all the way to left)*Hybrid Mode on (this is ESSENTIAL, it shuts off the dedicated graphics card when not needed)*In Advanced Power Settings, adjust all of the AMD, Wireless, etc settings to their most ‚Äòbattery saving‚Äô optionDoing all that I‚Äôm getting over 5 hours browsing the internet, longer if I have the internet open and am mostly working in excel or word (ie: normal school work/reports for office/etc). For instance, editting this review in the Amazon window, 4.1 hours remaining w/ 55% (7.5 hours total est). 7-8 hours watching Youtube @720p in Edge. Brightness at whatever battery saver drops it to when it‚Äôs on high to begin with. I intend on trying to swap in an 80wh when the parts are available.Build quality:The fit/finish and overall feel of the unit hits above its price point. The keyboard is exceptional for productivity, aside from the slightly cramped numpad. The touchpad is responsive. The rear I/O ports are great for desktop duty. But lets be real, Lenovo doesn‚Äôt exactly have a great reputation when it comes to customer service and turnaround times for repairs. None of the laptop manufacturers do though really, save Apple. My last Lenovo, a Y700, lasted over 5 years. I figure, get it, do some stress testing on the processor/GPU (Cinebench, Furmark), watch some movies and do some white/black backgrounds to check for dead pixels, and cross your fingers. To extend warranty through them is $50/100/175 for 1/2/3 extra years respectively, I personally am planning at least the $50 for an extra year.Heat:There is one drawback, this thing gets hot. I was expecting better thermals as I tested out a Legion 5 with the 4600H + 1650ti combo a while back. I would say this one runs ~5c average hotter across the board, and will spike to 95-100C+ if you‚Äôre doing something intense like Cinebench or Flight Sim 2020. In Flight Sim, average CPU temps over a 20 min flight were ~76c, CPU Die avg was ~85C. Temps are lower playing less demanding games, and even normally demanding games like AC Origins CPU avg was low 70‚Äôs, so not terrible. I spent some time looking into this, and apparently these hopped up gaming laptops hitting 90-100C is ‚Äòokay‚Äô, even if I don‚Äôt really like or trust it. Also, the only option I know of that actually runs cooler than this with similar hardware is the Omen 15 AMD, so if temps are a priority may want to check that platform out. The Asus Tuf‚Äôs are as hot if not hotter, and the Dell G5 SE is a small portable sun. However, you do get something for this heat, the aforementioned Cinebench scores blow the competition out of the water, I still can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs on par with my desktop processor.Final Thoughts:This thing runs warm, looks good (if you like the aesthetic), has a phenomenal spec sheet for the price, and has best in class screen for a non special-order low-mid budget prebuilt. Would recommend, with the one slight caveat regarding heat.

  This laptop is good, performance, design, screen and fast.However, something is wrong.First of all, I always check hard disk whenever I buy a laptop since I sometimes experienced receiving used laptop instead of new. It happened to this laptop. I check hard disk and it was turned on 208 times before.It might be program error but as far as I know, they are pretty accurate(crystal disk info) It looks new but might be not. Maybe I am unlucky. I will post another review later after I investigate more.update 1.So, My purchase date and warranty start date are different.Usually, warranty starts when I first install Windows and turn on laptop first time.This laptop had started warranty about more than 1 month ago, it doesn't any make sense to me.I talked about it with Amazon customer service and what they said is 'just return it',So disappointing so far.

  Edit 2: have been using the laptop for few month. No issues at all. Love it. Will move it back to 4 stars..........Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review. After 10 days, this vertical line appeared and it's constant through all applications, even in Bios. Meaning this is a hardware defect. Will change my review to one star for poor quality control. I have returned the laptop and Amazon honored 30 day return window. The new units doesn't have this line. Will see if the same problems happens in the next few weeks.............................If you're not willing wait to RTX 3000. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. The build quality is good. Fan is quite and powerful. Love it.I've been using the laptop now for a week. It's much better than what I thought. Super quite when you need it be quite. Powerful when you need it to be powerful. I actually returned the Helios 300, which I bough for 999 as well on a deal. Helios 300 has RTX 2060 which is not so different from 1660 Ti (Don't let them fool you). .With helios noise at idle is just unbearable, Intel heat is ridiculous as well and the build quality doesn't come close Legion 5.  Legion 5 Beats it at all the way. .

  I really like the new design. It looks like a workstation more than a gaming laptop!I'm gonna try and keep this short:PROS:- build quality is excellent,- specs are insane,- 2.5kg and the dimensions make it really portable,- screen is amazing! 144Hz and 300nits.- Ryzen 7 4800H...- GTX 1660ti is great for video editing and gaming!- laptop feels premium!CONS:- speakers are mediocre. Volume is decent but the sound quality is ok.-battery is really bad...less that 4 hours.- there is no international warranty (now this is Lenovo fault)!To be honest, this laptop is best buy at this price (999$). I'm really glad I bought it!Edit:There is a lot of problems with Linux...I actually thought Lenovo was the best with open source drivers and support for Linux...I was wrong.I can't run Linux, I can't have warranty in my own country, I can't have normal battery life. I guess I'll return it!Edit 2:I have random freezes. It just stops responding while doing random stuff. Returning it!

  I love this laptop. It's lightweight, powerful, fast, has a long battery life, and it works very well in general. It reboots in about 5 seconds, and you can completely bend it backwards and it will switch to tablet mode that has been designed for touch screen use. The only problem I have encountered is my computer crashing/going black when using Shockwave on Chrome. You can hear the fans sometimes, but they don't bother me as they aren't too loud. I bought this laptop refurbished for a great deal: about 20% off of the website's new asking price. It came without a box or manual, just the laptop and charger. It looked and acted new when I took it out. It had no bumps or blemishes. Its shipping packaging allowed for it to arrive safely.  I bought a laptop for the same price previously, and it was heavy, slow, and had a short battery life and very loud fans, so this is a great laptop for the price.

  You know, I really liked this laptop for the first year I got.  It has great battery life, it's very light weight and durable.  Good internal mic and speakers.I have a few gripes though with this machine.  One, my touch screen stopped functioning almost immediately after the warranty expired.  There are no fixes other than taking it in to a professional.  Without the touch screen, it's just an expensive laptop and its functionality is cut in half.Lenovo support is a travesty.  Takes forever, their updates reduce functionality, and many of their updates autmatically override settings.  I wouldn't really be surprised if one of the updates was responsible for the screen malfunctioning.The computer is solid, but I won't be buying another lenovo for the aforementioned reasons.

  My daughter bought this for her computer to take to college.  She's had it for about 3 months now & loves it!  Great value.  It was between this & a MacBook (which she'd had previously).  After much debate we chose this & have been very happy with it.She likes being able to take notes with the pen/notepad feature too.  It folds completely over.Great computer.

  *** Note this review is about using Linux (Ubuntu 17.10) as the main OS ***This laptop is fabulous. I have the i7 version and it is a great upgrade from my previous Asus. I've had it for a week now and with 17.10 ubuntu, everything works perfectly. I had to do no hacks reported online (disable ideapad module, etc) and everything works out of the box. There is some annoyances (the right shift key) but no deal breakers. My work laptop was a lenovo too, so the top row Fn keys doesn't bother me at all - infact i like it like it is. The screen is really nice and bright, and the processor is sufficient for my developer needs. I am going to replace the M.2 with a 1TB soon and will update the post when i do (looking at the evo 860 [https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-860-SATA-Internal-MZ-N6E1T0BW/dp/B07822Z77M])

  I really like Lenovo products, but this model was changed in some of its details that made it irritating to use. The Shift key is moved farther to the right and down which means I can't seamlessly type without picking up my right hand everytime I need the Shift key. Also, the camera was moved from the top of the screen to the bottom of the keyboard which makes no sense unless you want a view of your hands and torso. These may not seem like big deals while reading this, but then you try using them. Small changes, but pretty big negative impacts.I returned the (10 model and got the later model where Lenovo has moved the Shift key back to its normal position of almost every keyboard and the camera is back at the top of the monitor.

  Went through two of these computers. They're gorgeous, but there seems to be a connection issue between the screen and the actual computer. Both times after a few weeks of normal work the screen would start to flicker and an up not turning on.

  I have only had this laptop for a little over a year, and it has already begun to fall apart. The speakers haven't worked since day one, but how is a full-time student supposed to return their number one tool for Lenovo's notoriously slow customer service to fix a ""small"" issue.Here I am a year later, and screws have begun fall off the back of my laptop. A good portion of my research is on this machine, and now it is at risk of suddenly and randomly giving out.Not a reliable product. Do not purchase if you are looking for something reliable.Update: Video quit working as well

  Don't buy this laptop unless you want to waste your money, or at least get a damage protection insurance if you are willing to mail it to somewhere to Texas and who know how much you have to wait for it to be fixed.I've been using that laptop for 6 months, the battery life is horrible, so you cannot take it out anywhere and I did not. It became pretty much a desktop. But that's not the end of the story.After 4 months I started hearing a noise whenever I open it,  but didn't pay much attention and yesterday I opened it as normal and my hinge finally broke. After little research I found out that it's well known issue with these laptops, and it's described in thousands of comments. just google ""lenovo y50 hinge problem"".It's definitely manufacturer  defect, but they won't accept that - I called customer service but the technical representative said that they don't have any issues with those laptops, so they won't cover it.I'm very disappointed and definitely will stay away from anything made by Lenovo. It's not a cheap laptop to have such kind of issues.But hey s*** happens at least they should be honest about their mistakes with customers who trusted them once, of course,  if they care about their customers.

  Okay, I've had this computer for a little over a year now. And, up until the past few months I would have rated it higher.I'm glad I waited to review, because, honestly? I wouldn't recommend this computer, or even this brand, to anyone at this point. While the computer itself runs just fine, the hardware has been steadily breaking with each passing day.I initially decided on this computer because I had a thinkpad before this, which, while broken to the point that I couldn't even use it by the time I was done with it, lasted me years, even when I got it secondhand, refurbished by IBM. When I was shopping for a new one, this laptop met most of my requirements, including the full keyboard and screen size.The first issue I noticed was rather early on, shortly after I got it; A fan on the inside, for whatever reason, makes a sound like it's being pressed on. It's loud enough to get annoying if I don't have headphones in. But it's something I could ignore, for the most part.But then, a few months ago, the right click just stopped working properly. I have to push down rather hard to get it to work, and sometimes even that doesn't pan out, so I've been reduced to only the double-tap clicking method, or using a mouse. It makes clicking and dragging almost impossible.Around the same time, the right side of the plastic that protects the hinges began popping out for no apparent reason. It get's caught on the top right edge of the keyboard part, and when that happens, I have no choice but to force it open, and it makes an awful cracking sound. I've been fearing that it would snap part of the plastic protector, and sure enough, a bit of the plastic snapped off a few days ago, though I've had it taped in place to the best of my ability to limit how much the part could displace itself.Yes.Taped. I am to the point that I've begun taping my $1000 laptop to try and keep it from falling apart. I'm afraid that the screen itself is going to start coming up. And I'm the sort of person that takes a LOT of care with my laptops. I've never dropped it, never pulled it open too forcefully (until it started breaking and forcing me to,) never grabbed it by the screen; I don't even use the touch screen.It's just frustrating, because I do like the computer itself; It runs quickly, I've never had issues with malware, I like the full keyboard, and I even like the display. But I invested in this expecting it to last me a few years, and I'll be lucky if I even make it one and half before some serious piece of hardware breaks for no reason. Seriously, just skip it. If you're paying this much for a computer, get a better one.

  Where to Begin.I really like this computer until one time, the left hinge of the screen connection just completely came undone. It still worked, I just could not closer the laptop and therefore, could not transport it. I wondered what I must have done to cause this. Turns out, this is a very common issue that is caused in the factory production and when I called customer service to have the laptop repaired, they knew what it was and repaired it right away because it was under warranty... but they didn't change anything about the assembly. You can see where this is going. I get the laptop back, and a few months later (by this point the warranty had passed), the top half of the screen turned a shade of green, and I could no longer see red colors in that half. It was another common issue, and they knew about it as soon as I described it. I called customer service and they could not fix it. They tried to ""escalate my case."" but it was not allowed. I lived with it by plugging the laptop into a monitor when I needed it for my design work. Mind you, this is the screen breaking that THEY fixed a short while ago. I was doing hardly anything to this laptop. Never dropped it, and kept it in a protective case.Now it comes full circle; the left hinge fell apart again. I called customer service and they would not help me because they didn't view it as a ""factory issue,"" even though it clearly was judging by the fact that it happened twice after it was in the factory. They will not fix it, and I'll have to buy a new laptop despite the fact that this one actually runs quite well. The laptop itself runs fine despite a lackluster battery life, but the faulty hardware has completely ruined my experience with this product. I rely on this laptop for my professional work, and it completely let me down.If you care about having quality products and quality business transactions, DO NOT ever buy a Lenovo product. They are clearly a company with no class, and they should be ashamed that they let such a faulty product go out into the hands of a poor college student twice while they smugly denied any blame for their own issues. I'm a designer, and the designers at Lenovo were clearly not doing their jobs and should be fired. The customer service members were kind enough, they just clearly had terrible orders from their upper management who clearly have no connection to the quality of their product as long as schmucks like us keep buying them to avoid the high prices of an apple computer. Unbelievable.

  I had already ordered a T495 with a Ryzen 3700u from Lenovo with similar specs for $950 (a substantial discount from their list price) when I saw this item on Amazon for $650. I ordered from Amazon and will send the other one back to Lenovo as soon as it gets here.The benchmarks for the 3500u actually seem to beat out the more expensive 3700u which I had already ordered. I don't know what explains this, but according to my research this computer should perform about the same as the one with the better processor.I was a little concerned about the screen because none of the reviews I found online where for a T495 with touch. In fact the screen is just fine, if slightly too dim. I haven't had a situation where the brightness isn't enough, but it would be nice to have a little headroom in this regard.Everything about the computer is really nice. Very solid build, looks and feels great. The keyboard feels good and the touchpad is decent, though not as good as my old Surface Book 2. The hinges are sturdy and hold the display at whatever angle I need. The ports are all great and feel solid; nothing is loose in them.Unfortunately the provided 65W charger doesn't provide for fast-charging, so I'll be upgrading that. I have a 16 GB RAM stick coming which by all accounts will give the computer a substantial boost in performance thanks to opening up dual-channel RAM usage. With a $60 16gb RAM stick and about the same amount for a bigger SSD I have a great computer at a bargain price. I doubt I could do much better without getting something used.

  I looked at HP, Dell, Samsung, apple, ASUS and others and settled for Lenevo T495. It has the best processor, expendable  memory, slim and lift weight and long life battery. Working great so far.

  I purchased this computer to replace an older XPS 13.  This is a quad core processor from AMD with 8gb of ram.  The computer has 1 open slot for ram upgrades.  So far so good....comes with a 3-year warranty from Lenovo so thats a nice to have.  Recommend for others who needs a fast performing machine with great keyboards that won't break the bank.

  Lenovo Support and Premium Care Worst in Industry - DO Note Care about CustomersI bought a Lenovo Yoga C740 14"" - Mica laptop on July 20, 2020 on about Sept 1st, 2020 the screen cracked and the touchscreen no longer worked. The shutter for camera cracked when we tried to close the shutter and it cracked the screen making 3 full length cracks in the screen.I called support via chat and explained the issue they said they would give me  a replacement and they would call in 2-3 days. I week later I called back, escalated the issue and they said for sure in 2 days they would call. 3 days later called back, escalated the issue a 2nd time. Again assurance someone would call.Waited more than a week and called again! this time asking for a full refund. They said they understood and someone would call me.Waited another week, more than 1 month as passed now with cracked screen. I called support on the phone spent 45 mins on the line being transfered and put on hold to finally get hung up on.I called premium support and again they said they will escalate and someone will call. I asked for supervisor or manager. Waited 10 mins only to tell me they are busy! They would call me. I asked for an exact time and they did not want to give it. Finally had no choice but to wait again.Laptop was bought for my son to do his school work now with a cracked screen which can cut him. I cannot get a refund, replacement or anything. Cannot buy a new one until I get a refund as I cannot afford to buy 2 laptops!!!We are screwed and no one at lenovo wants to help, cares to help or i suspect is even able to help. This is by far the worse support and premium care I have ever experience in my lifetime. They build bad laptops then make it impossible to get it fixed, replaced or get a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  This PC is solid and worth its mid-level price.  At 1 TB, the SSD should last us many years, and with 16 GB of RAM, the processor and PC's speed can be realized.  The display is beautiful, although it's a bit glossy for daytime use.  Even so, I would highly recommend both the PC and the supplier who provided the lowest price including shipping.

  I had Gen 2 and this one no better. It has a very weak graphic card and barely can support Zoon and something. Photo editing is sluggish. Lenovo messed with ports: you can not use LAN and USB-C simultaneously because of a bug.

  I bought a ThinkPad T480 with a 4-year warranty in May 2018.  On December 15, 2018 it started crashing and auto-rebooting continuously.  Since that time over 60 days ago they have replaced the hard drive, the motherboard, and the RAM, but it still crashes within a few hours of turning it on.  Today I asked them to replace the entire machine with a new one.  I've bought 12 Lenovo computers in the last 2 years (personal and work) and 5 of them have had issues, but never as bad as this T480.  The lost productivity due to a broken computer, not to mention the time it takes to deal with Lenovo support, has convinced me that a Lenovo laptop is a poor investment.  Fare thee well, Lenovo.  I hope you get your act together someday and bring back the ThinkPad quality and reputation.  For now I'll go with your competition.

  worse, i spent an hour googling to download the AMD Ryzen graphic software to disable the automatic brightness. Lenovo should have install this by default but not they did not. Had 1 hour zoom meeting and battery went down to 40%. Yes I know zoom consumes battery but 60% in 1 hour? I thought this is the X series not some incompetent entry level product. I already returned it. Terrible product.

  Good ergonomic keyboard + extremely fast + not much installed junk +  less heat vs my 4 years old one.  I'm using this Lenovo to use the Firefox and Chrome + MS office+ movies+ pictures, but not thing else.  Windows 10 setup is ridiculous as always.  Need to install an additional hard drive to backup history.  AMD CPU is not widely supported in many software and emulators, so I'll leave those to my desktop or the cloud.  What I have to hate is the average battery life and fan noise.  The charger is huge, but only heat up if I use the laptop.  Fan noise gives out annoying hum sounds and does not sound like a fan I know.  If I use it in a quiet location,  this fan noise can eventually drive me crazy.

  I received this computer in new condition. I have been using it for about a week and so far I am extremely happy. I have never been someone who liked watching TV on a laptop, that is until now. I have watched easily 18 hours of Netflix on this laptop in just the short time I have had it. the screen quality is great and it is just so easy to use. It is very fast and responsive as well.So far I have had two minor issues with it. It has shut down a couple of times when I was watching Netflix, out of the blue.  It was losing WiFi signal and auto restarting. I think I have fixed the issue by changing some settings. I have also called the ISP and they changed some settings on the router as well. I am still experiencing poor WiFi signal but the laptop has not shut down since making these changes.There is some bloatware but it isn't too bad and some people might find it helpful. I have configured things to my liking for the most part. At first I was getting a ton of notifications. I have also personalized my tiles etc.  The settings are easy to find and the operating system is dare I say it, better than Windows 7, still some annoying features but there are many that I like.Overall, I would highly recommend this laptop. It is fast and powerful, the OS is pretty slick and easy to use and it is light and well built.

  I develop software and bought this machine because a lot of the tools I use are memory and CPU intensive (IDEs, Docker containers, etc.), and it has not disappointed! In my spare time I also play around with Unreal Engine 4 and a lot of 4K games, and it's a dream there as well; very good performance.I love the keyboard. It's not as good a keyboard as my trusty old Samsung RC512, but it's very comfortable and gives me the feedback I'm looking for. I have no problems typing on it all day every day, and have no problems touch typing on it.My only complaints are about the camera, touchpad, and product label on the bottom. The camera is placed directly below the screen (a so called ""nose cam""). Since my team is remote (and now working from home because of COVID) I am on Zoom all the time, so this placement is awful. It is the most unflattering angle, and any time you are taking notes during a meeting it looks like giant fingers are reaching out to attack the camera like in a bad ""invasion from outer space"" B-sci-fi flick.The touchpad itself isn't bad, but the left mouse button is both squeaky and feels cheap. The button is supported more toward the center-right than the left, so if you press down on the left mouse button too far to the left of center it squeaks, might not detect a click, and can get partially stuck. Just needed a bit more care in the engineering to making it better. It's not horrible, but it could be better.Lastly, about a month after I got it I noticed that the product label on the right side of the bottom of the unit (i.e. ""right side"" as in the side of the unit where the numpad is) was starting to peel off at the corner of the label. Since it's a spot where there's a lot of friction from resting on your lap, it would have been great if they had used a more durable label. I've tried adhering it with some strategically placed packaging tape but that, too, is peeling off. For a laptop that costs $1,200 to $1,500 you'd hope that the label would stay intact for at least the first year.

  I have the 32mb 1gig version and it does fine for office and some online game play. it get noisy when the the fans kick in to supercool but performance if fine. Keyboard is flimsy, after weeks the one of the arrow keys popped off and it took me some dumb luck to get it back on without damage. I feel f I have a long sleeve button shirt that if I catch it on the keyboard a key might pull off. It's also a bit heavy if you are looking for the new sleek look. Since I don't travel a lot sizr/weight is not a issue. If you are looking for sleek and power expect to pay almost double for it.

  ¬†Reaserched for weeks and after much deliberation and recommendation I got this ‚ÄúLegion‚Äù Laptop...I was so excited about finally getting a ‚ÄúFast‚Äù computer.... with and awesome processor and 32gbram ....it finally arrived today, carefully opened the box and slowly pulled the foam wrapping out... unfolded it and took the laptop out of the bag.... you would think I was touching the crown jewls....Pushed the power button and it fired right up......AWESOME!!!That is until I started loading my programs on it...First had to do a system update, no big deal was expecting that.... well after the OS updated some kind of Flash Kernel showed up and said I needed to close all programs- do not unplug or turn off laptop... so I did... clicked next.... THREE HOURS LATER ..it‚Äôs still stuck on a black screen.....Had to force shut down and hope it restarted....Well it did....worked fine, installed office and my Adobe apps.... NOW ONCE AGAIN.... it‚Äôs frozen.... can‚Äôt click on anything, CNT-ALT-DEL WILL NOT EVEN WORK to pull up task manager to try and force close or restart.... so once again... sit here and hope it finally comes around and starts working again OR force restart and we all know how dangerous that is to a computer....Will more than likely be returning this in the morning and getting an HP or Dell which is a shame, been using Lenovo for a few years now and really like them.....

  Computer worked great until it started having a much-documented software glitch that has yet to be resolved in online forums or through contact with Lenovo customer service.Long story short, the CapsLck and NumLck keys trigger a pop-up notification that cannot be disabled and freezes the screen. This is a huge problem for gaming or animating programs that rely on the keys for various functions.After searching through online forums, I have yet to find a resolution and many of the previous posts about this issue remain unaddressed.

  Love my new laptop. I was skeptical at first to buy through Amazon, but the deal was too good to pass up. The sellers were super quick to help when I accidentally bought 2 instead of one and had caught it a lil late. Super smooth computer, and after hours of research it was the best bang for my buck I could find when needing a new laptop quickly!

  I purchased this for some light gaming and everyday use. It works great so far, fans are a little loud when stressed, but nothing too egregious. Screen looks great, and the backlit keys are a nice touch for gaming at night. So far Dvinity Original Sin 2 runs perfectly, so I am happy with the overall performace.The build quality is probably the best aspect of the machine. It is solid. It doesn't go overboard to look like a gaming laptop, it just looks nice and sleek. Overall very happy so far.

  It's great if you want to play games and enjoy some graphic quality (as long as it's not some AAA game of 2021). For graphic design, the monitor it's not good. The color representation doesn't compare to having a second monitor with 100% RGB color, but if you can't afford another monitor, try to compare your work on your phone screen.

  I purchased this laptop elsewhere. No issues with this computer at all until the touch screen function evaporated a few days ago. Then I found that the touch screen driver is missing and Lenovo's technical support has no option to replace it. I will have to send my computer to them for repair. The touch screen was a major reason for my interest in this computer. I have also learned that Lenovo laptops are known for having display problems. This was my first Lenovo purchase, and it will likely be my last.

  I was excited about this laptop.  It was what my IT guy recommended and what we wanted.  It arrived on time but would not power up for me or my IT professional.  Very surprising that an Amazon 3rd Party vendor would allow a dead laptop to make it out the door.  I did return it and eventually did get a full refund.  But what a surprising and irritating experience.

  The computer arrived a day early,  we had to spend a few hours updating as expected.  We bought this because of the requirements of my sons college.  It had all the bells and whistles and the price was about $400.00 less than the competition. It is nice and light and sturdy so it won't be heavy when he actually has to start carrying it around with him on campus!  I also bought the 4 year warranty which should get him through all 4 years.  Very happy with my choice.

  Great Laptop!! For the price this a a must buy. Only could give 4 stars because it didn't come ready to use. It was so outdated and some updates wouldn't even update such as 1903 and 1909, but that problem can be easily fixed by going through Microsoft site and updating it to the newest windows available using Microsoft assistant.

  Build quality of this laptop is exceptional. Evenly thin and lightweight. Keyboard is comfortable and trackpad worked smoothly. However, wi-fi connections are a problem. At times, the laptop stayed connected for 3-4 hours at a time. Other times, it disconnected after a few minutes and threw fits like that until it finally decided to maintain the connection again for hours.I feel like this may be an issue with the laptop and potential wireless routers being used. I feel that's a reason why some people continue to have issues with Lenovo models and others don't. Still, for the price, give it a shot. You'll either love it because it works or hate to dislike it because, again, it's such a quality product in every respect but the wi-fi problems.

  The computer works as advertised, but I thought I was specifically ordering Window 7 installed. Instead I received it with Windows 8. I'm slowly learning to cope with this turkey of an OS, but I'm not happy with Amazon. Friends suggested I return the computer for credit, but I didn't.Norm

  I purchased this laptop as a Christmas present for one of my family members.  I have always been under the impression that Lenovo made really good laptops, and I think that the hardware on this particular model lives up to that reputation.  However, the software side is what really disappointed me to no end - Not just because of Lenovo, but also Microsoft.Before I begin, be fore warned that Lenovo put a whole lot of bloat-ware on this machine.  Plus there are like 6 different partitions, which is ridiculous.  Just to test it out, I tried using the laptop before making any modifications, but it was really slow and clunky to use.  Needless to say, it was a mess and would be a burden to use as is.  It makes me wonder how many PC users out there ever experience how smooth and fast a stock Windows 8 machine really is when there is absolutely no bloat-ware getting in the way...  It's my opinion that these manufacturers ruin the Windows experience and are primarily responsible for the bad rep that Windows gets...The first thing that I always do when I buy a new laptop or desktop is to wipe the hard drive and re-install Windows (You will need Windows OEM discs to do this).  Since this laptop comes with Windows 8 core installed, I had went ahead and purchased an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro because of the low price (which I had downloaded the install disc from MS).  So I went ahead and wiped the HD, and proceeded to install Windows 8 pro...  Only, I had encountered an error during the installation that prevented me from completing the install.  And this is the part that you should pay attention to -  When Windows 8 comes pre-installed on a laptop, know that THE SOFTWARE KEY IS EMBEDDED IN THE BIOS.  Meaning, if you purchase a laptop with Windows 8 core edition, the only way that you can upgrade the laptop to Pro or Ultimate is through the control panel to the ""get more features with a new edition of Windows..."".  Microsoft's reasoning behind this is to make piracy more difficult.  To me, as a system builder, it just adds an annoying step.  So no more of the good ole' days when you could just simply wipe out a machine and reinstall whatever version of Windows you like on it, as long as you had a valid key.Honestly, I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get this laptop going.  Since I had already wiped out everything on the hard drive, I had to purchase the factory discs from Lenovo to reinstall Windows.And after two sets, neither worked.  Lenovo's tech support is awful, and they weren't any help.  Plus, they are obviously located in India (which doesn't bother me because they were nice people, but they really had a hard time with English).  Despite my aching wallet at this point, I then went ahead and purchased an OEM Windows 8 core disc.  With that, I was able to re-install Windows on the laptop (which, because the product key is embedded in the bios, it was never asked for during the install).  Once I got a clean install of Windows 8 core up and running, I tried multiple times to use the Windows 8 Pro key that I had previously purchased, within the ""add features..."" in control panel.  Despite my efforts, I was never able to upgrade the version of Windows 8 from core to pro.  I spent may hours on the phone with Microsoft, but they were no help.  So finally, I just said screw it.  At least it has a clean version of Windows 8 installed...In the end, the laptop now runs a clean, bloat-free version of Windows 8 and has turned out to be a pretty good laptop.  The only problem that I have run into now is that the touchpad driver will sometimes just stop working which will require a reboot to get it working correctly again.  I will also note that this laptop comes with a 24GB SSD and a standard HD.  The SSD is pretty much useless.  However, if you want to upgrade the standard HD to a better SSD, you can do so very easily.  The bottom cover comes off pretty easily, and there is a video on youtube on how to do so.  You can also upgrade the memory easily.

  First I want to say that I would have probably rated this much higher.  Nice looking machine, usable touchpad and keyboard.  Screen and ports all good in my opinion.  Battery life has been ok.  Was hoping it would be better - get maybe 3 hours on it (my previous Asus with a low power processor got about 8 under the same use).  Now to the bad news or why this gets a one rating.Simply the issue that it can't reliably connect to any WiFI.  I've used several routers at home and at various places.  In each case it connects for a while, then it randomly disconnects.  (Search for u410 wifi issues - literally pages!!).  Anyway I've tried to work around this.  I bought one of those mini USB wifi adapters thinking that would help.  Nope...  From what I've read it is a combination of the adapter and the bios. Also mine is manufactured after the magical date of July 2012 so in reality Lenovo never really found the reason for the issue.  Just a bunch of bull... It's just unfortunate as this is my main daily computer and half the time I'm on my phone instead of the computer.Oh and BTW it seems that these problems are not limited to the U410.

  We have owned many Lenovo Think Pad Laptops, but the Idea Pad has been a disappointment. After 2 years of light use the hinge broke and NO ONE has parts including Lenovo. Lenovo just says ""sorry."" After reading the Lenovo Forums, I see this is a very common problem with the plastic tops. Would not purchase another Idea Pad.

  I've had this for about 3 weeks and it is fast and comfortable.  I was very disappointed it didn't come with a camera built in as shown in the photo.  I requested a second laptop sent to me by Amazon Shipping and it was exactly the same, so no one in shipping looks to see if the product they ship matches the product being described.  I had to buy a Logitech 920 which is great but expensive.  This does have a Lenovo warranty until 8/2016, but I had to go to the Lenovo website to verify that. The color sensor and fingerprint reader shown on the photo in Amazon are NOT on the product. The keyboard lamp is there if you press F+space bar. The red Track Point pointing stick and the TrackPoint buttons in the center work great. I had never used these before but they are very sensitive and easy to use with a thumb and finger. I use a mouse most of the time but if you don't use a mouse these are great. Mine did NOT have an HDMI port as the Amazon page stated . It does have 2 USB3 connections and 2 USB2, one out the back for a mouse. Speakers are good, headset works fine. The really good news is that it is cool to rest your hand on. My last Lenovo IdeaPad practically burns my left hand to rest it there. It seems to generate very little heat and fans are quiet.  The Windows 7 is ok, if you don't mind doing your own Windows 10 upgrade.  The W8 screen shown on this photo that I am looking at is not accurate. You don't get those blocks, which is better as far as I am concerned. My only disappointment with this laptop is that I didn't get everything that was shown or described on the Amazon page: no camera, no HDMI port, no color sensor or fingerprint reader.  Secondly I was disappointed with Amazon, who shipped this, for not having a system to check the product out to make sure they sent the correct one, or to make sure the product matched the description.  I did get a 20% discount because of this which covered the Logitech camera. The big problem is when you ask a question, you may get anyone of 8 different suppliers answering your question, and they all have slightly different models, so what they say you will get may not be what some other seller will send you. You have to deal directly with the buyer to arrange shipping from them to be sure what you will get.

  This laptop was clearly not functional within an hour of setting it up.  It bluescreens constantly, and none of the typical things you'd do to diagnose and fix the bluescreens fixed it.  This included a total fresh reinstall of Windows as well as a number of software diagnostics recommended by Lenovo.  None of it worked.  This is clearly a hardware problem, so I returned it.  Amazon's return policy states that if they disagree with your assessment that the computer doesn't work, they'll charge you a fee ($165) for restocking.  That's what they did to me.  So they intend to sell you the same broken laptop they sold me.  Buyer beware!

  This is my 1st gaming laptop and I did a ton of research before pulling the trigger. For the price, it's a beast. Unfortunately mine is defective and drops 15-21% of frames in high resolution video playback. I bought it for 4k video editing as well as gaming so this is a BIG issue. I'm now wrestling with Lenovo to get it fixed or replaced. I 'd like to return it but at this point I wish I had researched the seller a little. Please don't misunderstand, their price was great, shipping was very fast but their return policy is so harshly rigid its clear they do not actually accept returns.  Words of warning: if you order from them, keep everything associated w your package and keep it in perfect condition. If you try for a return(good luck!) repack everything so that it looks as though the box was never opened, if not it will be rejected and you are paying shipping both ways. I will update this review once my machine is fixed or replaced.

  love the design not only is this laptop a beast at gaming ,but also looks and feels sleek and doesn't just look like a gaming laptop. The main games i play are rust and modern warfare , they run amazing at high settings. The fan noise isn't to bad either i have owned a older laptop before hand and that one was much much louder. screen is a bit small for me for gaming ,but thats because im used to a 27 inch monitor from my desk top. The only  thing i can think about disliking is the 512 ssd storage ,but you can always just unscrew the 11 screws on the bottom and plug a 2 tb ssd right next to it so not really a big deal. If you need a portable ,fast ,sleek gaming laptop this is the one for you.

  A vertical line appeared on the screen, I read reviews of the 1660ti variant and some users have had the same issue. I used this laptop very  lightly and carefully during 2 weeks, sometimes I opened it and the screen was black and sometimes I couldn't adjust brightness.

  The laptop shipped quickly.  It appears pretty sturdy, though a bit plasticky.  The keyboard is great, much better feel than my work laptop or my older samsung laptop.  The screeen is bright and sharp.  I'm impressed by the system speed.  Proper dual channel 3200MHz ram, fast 4800H cpu.  While running a few quick tests, the system was running 4.09GHz all core for the cpu-z stress test.  The fans are quiet and the keyboard and deck area were cool during ~20 minutes of gaming.  There are always better products on the horizon, but overall I'm pleased with this laptop.Update 5-10-21:  I continue to be impressed with this laptop.  It runs newer games very well and older games at ridiculous frame rates ( Portal and Talos Principle running at 200+ FPS).  The cooling system works very well and the integrated graphics can run many of my games at reasonable frame rates.  The battery life isn't that great, but long enough to watch a movie. Very pleased for the price.

  Laptop came factory sealed and in perfect condition. Beast Amd 2060 115w!*1 month update*I've traveled with it and used it pretty heavily and can say that this thing is amazing. Games run smooth, cyber punk on ultra with rtx on dlss on balanced I get about 55 fps, no rtx I can get 70+ on ultra. Temps are ridiculously low, gpu never goes over 70c at 97 to 99% performance. I'm coming from console so I was very skeptical of gaming on a laptop but I'm pretty sure I'll never buy a console ever again. After playing on ultra in a few games trying to play games on ps4 looks awful, I understand why pc players never turn back to consoles. This laptop provides the same games with better graphics at higher frame rates and its portable!

  This product is available in many forms. The 512 SSD and 16GB ram is probably the most functional and versatile.One of the upgrades allows a faster processor, but that doesn't appear to be needed. Also, the touch screen option is not great for a standard form lap top without a touch pen option.The screen format is superb. Excellent brightness and the new configuration height gives nearly the same screen use as a standard 14 inch screen.Rather than give a long and detailed review of speed and processor quality, this information is available at many review sites.Needless to say, I have a Lenovo Yoga 14 and a Dell XPS 13.This is my go to laptop.It has a small footprint, great keyboard, and a screen configuration that makes it more useable than the 14 inch laptop.And, did I mention how light it is?This is an awesome laptop.

  I tested the Lenovo C940 14"" IL 2 in 1 4K UHD 16GB 512 GB SSD + 32GB Optane against the HP spectra 360x 4k OLED 13 inch 16GB 1 TB SSD 32GB Optane and preferred the C940 hands down and here is why. First off the keyboard is fantastic. It has just enough travel for me plus they hit the mark with the touch pad. It is perfectly off center so when you type you are not accidently hitting the touchpad like I did on the HP (which is huge and centered). Also the screen resolution is beautiful on the C940 with the 500 nits over the OLED 400 nits. The speed was the same when I hit the bar because both have 32GB Optane. The 14 inch Lenovo screen gives you not only a brighter screen but it is perfect at the recommended setting for having a normal reading resolution. When you enlarge the HP spectra 360x screen because it is soooo small, you lose real-estate on the screen. I only enlarged the HP from the recommended 300 to 250 and I could not access my FSW portal as the schools banner was now up in front of the sign in tab. Never mind the obvious reason, that the Lenovo it is much cheaper in price but not quality and is just as nice. I also went with the Lenovo C940 because it has an on board pen that I will not lose because it is stored right in the laptop. I honestly don't find it to hot. I does get warm but only during windows download and that is when I heard the fans, otherwise I have not had a problem or heard the fans since.I am 58 and not a tech person, just a woman who did her research and did a hands on comparison of the two laptops. I know that all those machine test that they show on the YouTube reviews puts the HP ahead but on a user end review the Lenovo C940 out shines the HP Spectra 360x (which by the way gets cranking hot! with normal use). Oh yes and the battery life on the HP is ridiculously short (4 to 6 hours tops. It died in sleep mode and I had to reduce resolution and brightness so what's the point of the OLED?). The Lenovo gets about 9 to 10 hours so far.If something changes I will edit this review.

  It seems to check off all the good boxes for a laptop as a 2 in 1 with 4k definition and good speakers.  Sadly, the battery life is horrible--about 4 hours--which is how long it takes to charge, a very long time for a battery this small.  There is a pen built into the laptop but it's small with a very poor battery life.  And if you try to get another stylus on here, almost none work.  How poorly designed.Worst of all is Lenovo's service, or I should say lack thereof.  Called up support, and it tells you they are backed up with calls so go online to setup an appt for a return phone call.  What?  That is okay.  I will save them the time, and return this computer.  The combination of a poorly made product with zero customer service is not a pill most people will swallow.

  We bought this for one of our employees to use as a business laptop and we are an architecture firm so we have fairly high demands on our computers. This seems to be doing the job so far. Was easy to set up out of the box and haven‚Äôt had any issues so far. Very lightweight and nice large screen. Don‚Äôt think this model is a touch screen as far as I know.

  I was happy with the speed and feel of the computer but very disappointed in the quality of the built-in camera.  In a time of lots of Zoom I found it‚Äôs quality to be unacceptable and had to add a camera for my Zoom sessions.

  This computer is generally really great. The display is crystal clear, the keyboard is responsive, it's light & portable, the sound is impressive for its size, and the processor/memory is able to keep up with my illustration apps and some light gaming. I have two minor issues and a major one.The fingerprint scanner can be touch or go. Half the time it doesn't even register my finger and I have to sign in with my PIN. Not a big deal.The supplied pen has a really poor battery life. Like less than an hour. Not to mention retrieval of the pen from its garage is very inconvenient. I just got a Lenovo Active Pro Pen and it works great with it.The major issue is with the graphics card (I think). Since receiving this product, there have been numerous graphical glitches (youtube videos freezing except for a small band, the display being replaced by white and grey vertical stripes, difficulties with some other simple graphical tasks). Some research has shown that the graphics card in this model has had some reports of being faulty, or ""dying"" soon after delivery. So be carfeul, and make sure you get a warranty.

  I've had the laptop a couple days. WAS loving it.  Touchscreen works great,  keyboard is easy to use and the backlighting is good.  Ability to work in multiple windows and programs with no lag. No issues with fingerprint and don't use pen so I can't speak to that. But was excited for it.  Then today after a short period of use I got a light gray screen with black and white lines.  Couldn't get out of it. Had to restart the computer completely. Now my screen is vibrating all the graphics.  It's just a simple picture background.  Shouldn't do that.  I'm pretty upset.  3 days and it does that? Will be returning.

  I bought this laptop on 1/27/21.  I have already had one Lenovo service tech on a house call due to the mic not working. I am now awaiting another home service call pending a part that needs to be ordered. The reason this time is the laptop will not power on.  No timetable on when the part will be available.

  I bought two of these for me and my wife.  Overall it is sleek, responsive, and generally reliable.  The best part about it is the sound quality.  Phenomenal for a device this size.  However, this is one of the worst engineered devices I have ever laid my hands on.  Two screws under the back foot pad create a faraday cage which cripples the wifi.  Remove them and everything works fine.  My only other complaint is the lack of docking station support.  I have a Lenovo USB-C Thunderbolt 3 dock from my ThinkPad which has and continues to work flawlessly for over a year.  Since moving to my Yoga 9i I have had nothing but problems with bluescreens and monitor disconnects requiring regular power cycles to recover from.  I have tried updated drivers both from Lenovo as well as Intel. Nothing resolves the issue.  I attempted to reinstall Windows which leads to my final complaint... the BIOS does not support bootable USB media formatted with anything but Fat32... Given that Microsoft creates installer drives with files larger than 4GB this is unacceptable.  Unless you are comfortable creating your own installer WIMs with a smaller file size, do not expect to have an easy time installing any OS on this model beyond the built-in Fresh Start option in Windows.At the end of the day, I love this thing... but every time I come across one of these issues I want to throw it in a bin.

  I bought this Yoga 9i to replace a Yoga 900 series that had run out of disk space. I was happy to find that the 1TB of storage is all on the C drive, unlike the 900 where 500GB was partitioned between C and D (if it hadn't been, I wouldn't have run out of disk space and would still be using it).I use Microsoft 365 on this PC. The battery life does seem a little shorter than my old Yoga, but I haven't yet run it long enough to exhaust the battery. I haven't yet tried the stylus function.Overall it's fast and reliable and I highly recommend it.

  I got the Yoga 9i after my Yoga 2 Pro died. I loved almost everything about the Yoga 2 Pro, and expected that this iteration (4? generations later) would be better in every way. There are some great things about it, but some that are maddeningly stupid design decisions.LikeSame weight as Yoga 2 ProEasier to openUniversal (USB-c) chargingBigger touchpad than the 2-ProSpeakers might be betterProbably better hinge.Better WifiDon't likeKeys are hard to see in most light. The 2-Pro was white letters on black keys, and very easy to see in almost every light, and had a backlight for night. The 9i is grey letters on silver. Hard to see. Why?The function keys are non-standard, and less functional than the 2-Pro. Alt-F4 doesn't work to kill a program, and there is no single key to replace that, as there was on the 2-Pro. Maddening.I like the idea of the pen, but it's too thin for all but emergency use. If I am on the road and need to do a photoshop thing, it might be of some use, but at home, a proper tablet with a pen is vastly superior.If I was coming to the Yoga 9i fresh, I probably would have given 4 or 5 stars, but since Lenovo made some things worse, for no good reason, it seems that they are going for looks over function, and that greatly annoys me.

  Laptop is pretty fast for normal and average user. It takes almost 5-8 seconds till windows is up since powering up which is incredibly fast. I am not a gamer so I didn't try with heavy games.Battery doesn't last for 15 hours as described but still it lasts for 7-8 hours for browsing and normal usage.Pen embedded in laptop does really bother me every time I pull it off of the laptop as I should pull it off with two fingers (nails, and it almost broke mine) it's really hard to pull off but I am not a frequent pen user, however once pulled off, it works fine.Touchpad is good relatively to the size of the laptop.Connection to bluetooth with my galaxy buds plus earbuds is bad however connecting to other laptops is normal.Camera is average quality. I didn't really like how I sound in the mic and when people hear my voice they tell me you sound like a GOD. lol.

  Prior knowledge, I did get extensive help on choosing a good mid range PC to buy due to wanting something for heavy gaming but also something that is useful in a computer science course. I narrowed it down to the ""ASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14"" and the ""Lenovo Legion 5"".  As you would have guessed from me leaving a review, this was what I chose.Now I'll start with shipping, I will first admit that I had slight gripes with UPS' tracking feature because it shown that my product would come on the 18th but was apparently delivered 1 day earlier instead. I wanted to put this into the review just to let others know if UPS are delivering it assume that you have to be on the lookout the day prior as well. That being said if you miss it, the package will simply go to their access point. No big issue just took a day longer than expected to receive it. More importantly onto the quality of the shipment, it was really good considering that it was in traversal for over a week the laptop box inside of the shipping box was in perfect condition.Onto the quality of the laptop and charger after taking it out the box, I must admit that I have not directly opened the laptop to thoroughly check the inside contents nor tested every single port. However the laptop's outside and charger were perfectly fine, no scraps, scratches, or cracks which is to be expected. Upon testing the buttons they all felt relatively well made. The design choice of adding a ""butt"" to the laptop is something I haven't experienced before but having it contain the ports honestly feels great so far on first impressions.Now onto turning on the laptop, I was first greeted by the keyboard backlighting which I did ""scoff"" about for quite some time due to being able to type without looking but upon now experiencing it, it make finding keys I don't normally interact with feel better. The touchpad feels great, albeit since I play games I've still been opting to use a mouse I've owned but for classes it allows me to actually leave the mouse at home. I think something else I can add in this section is the screen, I was checking for dead pixels and that also came out perfectly fine. To continue on the topic of checking the laptop, what is advertised is what you receive, the storage will be slightly lower as I've never seen a computer actually have perfect storage due to the installation taking a portion of it, but mine started out with roughly 92% of advertised storage which is common.I will be honest that I don't know if I should dive into pros for a review because actual tech channels will inform you about what is common in the Lenovo legion 5 better than me raving or gushing about my experience with it. Tech YouTube channels can also give you rough comparisons between PCs which is why I chose legion 5 overall.Youtubers will also tell you cons but I guess I should mention what I've felt was a negative to think about. My sole negative is just battery life while gaming which originally I thought wouldn't affect me but I have tried to play a bit during break between classes and quickly figured out I'd be better off not doing that since I want to try and leave the charger at home. However it's not a major setback plus I have a switch anyways.I will also try to remember to give an updated review in 6months and if I remember 3 then 5years from now.

  First, I am not a sophisticated computer person. My wife and I bought this machine after consulting a younger family member. The AMD processor is very fast, and if you drop this machine and the screen breaks or cracks, it's relatively easy to put in a new one. Many other machines don't have this build feature. The case is durable and easy to handle. It's a great deal for the money.

  It's small and fast and everything works greats! The only flaw it has is the screen. The screen has an sRGB coverage of just 58%. What this means is that colors won't be accurate and it won't look as sharp. If you are just planning on using this for business stuff it's fine. If you are a photographer or plan on doing any kind of photo or video editing it's less than ideal but still very usable. You need to color calibrate the screen to get the best out of it. Contact me and I can send you my calibrated color profile.

  I bought this laptop because I wanted a laptop with a Ryzen CPU in it to do some C and Rust coding on.The performance and battery life is pretty great - surprising since it only has a 50Wh battery,I'm running Manjaro Linux on it and was able to get everything to work - the fingerprint reader included. The Arch Linux Wiki for this laptop was a great resource.I would love to see this exact laptop with a newer Ryzen CPU and a slightly larger battery.

  I've owned this laptop for over two years now, but I never got around to giving it a proper review because of how new it still feels. This comes as a shock since it was introduced in 2010. This laptop is possibly the best ultra-portable machine Lenovo has ever created. The Nehalem i5 processor inside is still fighting fit, and the HD 3000 graphics are a large step up from the GMA 965 in bygone models. Thanks to the new architectures, the battery life with a 9-cell battery can exceed 7 hours!An important note: This is the last machine with the ability to completely remove the touchpad, using only the trackpoint in the center of the keyboard. Not only that, but it is the last 16:10 X-series Thinkpad; the X220's screen is 1366*768 pixels.

  This wasn't quite the same X201 3626FRU machine as in the original Amazon product description here from which I made the purchase (since I received an X201 3626W58), but I was highly impressed with the price of this refurbished notebook from Data Sales Co and, at this point at least (having only had this machine for a day), I have to commend this seller on the quality of packaging, appearance and condition of this notebook. This Lenovo notebook is already a predictably great machine in a classic line of ultraportable business machines, so there's not much to be added to the praise it has received. So I'll focus these comments on the seller, Data Sales Co, which for $205 provided not only all but one of the machine specifications in the original ad, but exceeded several. The one spec not met was the inclusion of a fingerprint reader, but I can live without that, especially at this price level. Otherwise, this X201 included a 320 Gb HDD, 4Gb SDRAM (twice the amount quoted in the original Amazon ad), a flawless display, battery in ""Good"" condition with ""55"" cycles according to the Lenovo battery condition report and, amazingly, an extra included Ultrabase dock with a DVD/RW ultraslim drive installed. So not only do I highly recommend Lenovo thinkpads (I've owned several and bought several more for other users), but I also highly recommend Data Sales Co if you are ever looking, as I was, for a cheap, refurbished machine in good shape.

  Caveat here first:  I threw away the windows installation and use Linux.The only down side is that the screen is on the small side.  If you do a lot of word processing this might be a downer.  Other than that the build quality is EXCELLENT!  It feels solid.  The keyboard is really nice and positive and the keys regular size.  Touch pad is decently sized and feels very responsive.The laptop is pretty lightweight and very very portable.  Battery life is excellent.  I've used it for over 4 hours of continuous use without recharging.  Super easy to get in and out of my backpack.  When I fly I much prefer to use this laptop as it's super easy to get through security and fits easily on the tray in coach.Don't expect a supercomputer.  Again, I use it with Linux so it's plenty fast.  The Windows pro it came with weighed it down a lot.  You can still use it with Windows but Linux is where this computer shines!4 core Intel, SSD, 4GB of memory for less than $250 (and not a chromebook)?  You can't beat this deal!

  I love the size, weight, keys well almost everything about it. The screen resolution could be better but for a small LAP machine I can certainly live with it. The best part about buying this laptop was the seller. He assures that it is the real deal as far as reconditioned. Papers to show that it is official. My previous machine was a so called reconditioned off ebay. Total s*** machine with multiple problems, had to send it back. I am indead very happy with it.

  Everything was fine (very good condition) except the AC adapter cord. I didn't notice that the inner wire had been exposed. Unfortunately, it was the AC line (110 volts) not the DC line (19 volts). The laptop suddenly said that the adapter was not working correctly so I touched the adapter including the AC adapter cord to examine the reason. At that time, I thought it was just a connection problem. When I touched the AC cord, it sparked and I had to turn off the outlet. It could cause a severe injury if I touched the exposed wire, which was slightly cut by a sharp thing...

  The laptop arrived and was able to power it up immediately. It encountered some hiccups however. For the 1st  2 days of use, it just turns off by itself. It wasn't a battery issue or power problem. I followed some ideas from the Internet and it worked. I upgraded to win10 and I think it's more stable like this. I even added 2GB RAM to have 6GB in total and is still fine. No regrets here. Would've been nice to have gotten one with a Webcam though.

  I use these when I travel. Upgraded to another brand when my Thinkpad was destroyed in Israel. After many countries, then back to the US, I ended up with an old, used X201 again! They're that reliable and still fast/enough RAM. Only drawback is no SATA 3, but with an SSD HD, speeds are acceptable. Best part, you can swap out about any component and on the 9-cell batt, last an overseas flight before a charge is needed.

  this is a true beastpad. in terms of compatibility with your open source platforms, it gets no better than this. my #1 burner laptop. I would be careful dropping it though, because whatever you drop it on will be heavily damaged. it could possibly survive a nuclear blast.

  I bought a Lenovo P72 laptop some time ago.  This is a top of the line, expensive machine.  Occasionally it does not boot up.  I have to retry bootup several times.  Sometimes it starts right away and other times it takes hours to get it to work.  This is a boot problem as we never get into the windows loader.  This is NOT an issue of downloading upgrades or anything like that.  It just fails in the bios and won't even go into the BIOS setup.I tried contacting Lenovo.  After many tries I finally got a support ticket started.  They then cancelled the ticket, presumably by accident.I am fed up and will buy a competitor's machine and probably have to throw this one away.  It's not even a year old.  I buy several PCs per year for my business and will never buy another Lenovo.It's a shame because the machine is really nice when it actually works, but this one problem and failure to give any semblance of support makes it unacceptable for business use.  Lenovo, I hope you take notice and change your support before your entire customer base disappears.

  x1 carbons continue to be really good laptops, this is my third one, I've been using thinkpads a long time and x1 carbons since the first generation. A lot of software developers tend towards thinkpads, Linux drops right onto them and works great right away (I use Fedora). Other good laptops (the apple ones and Microsoft surface for example) have too much non-opensource hardware...

  I‚Äôve used a MacBook Pro for the last several years and the time came to update to a newer model.Before jumping right into another MacBook, I decided to look at PCs. After comparing multiple laptops, including a newer MacBook, I finally settled on the Lenovo laptop. The price was a big selling point due to the functionality of the Lenovo compared to all the other models.I feel you cannot go wrong with this computer.

  On balance, despite the fact that it gets *very* warm,  I'm very, very pleased with the other attributes of this machine. Only thing is, a week after I bought it and configured it, Lenovo put it on deal for over $400 less than I paid here on Amazon. If you have the luxury of time before you have to purchase, it really pays to search very carefully & thoroughly for these. Oh well, I guess that's just the nature of laptop marketing these days.

  When my first order arrived, I couldn‚Äôt use the laptop because it had been programmed for as a company computer. The reseller promptly took it back, returned the purchase price to my cc and gave me $100 gift card that I used for the correct laptop purchase. The reseller was great!!!  Very Helpful.

  The Thinkpad used to be a tank in the industry that stood up to wear and tear and kept going. It is no longer that. In less than one year, my touch screen started misbehaving. The cursor would move by itself and circular pings would appear and make selections as if the screen were touched. I had to disable the touch screen feature and live with the touch pad mouse. The fingerprint scanner went next. Then over the last 6 months, the black coating has bubbled and flaked off on the base, palm rest and sides. I use the laptop mostly at home and stick it in my leather case now and then and have travelled with it on an airline only three times. I will probably change it out later this year as it is looking really tacky. I'm not sure what model I will choose but I can promise that it will definitely not be a Lenovo Thinkpad.

  It‚Äôs just about perfect.My primary application is using ink on PowerPoint in my classes. As a University Computer Engineering Professor, I record videos of all my classes on my laptop to post on the web. My university used to provide Lenovo laptops to faculty; Over time I owned four (ThinkPad X200t, X201t, X220t, and X230t), all of which were great. Unfortunately, at some point my university switched to another brand. They graciously loaned me that brand of laptop to try. It was AWFUL. My old Lenovo X230t ThinkPad tablet worked better. With the newer computer, I would make a stroke with the stylus that would show up on the screen a full second or more later!I stewed over what to buy for about a year before settling on the X1 Yoga. One reason I waited so long was that I had upgraded my WIN7 X230t to 16 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. Until a recent price drop this was hard to duplicate/afford with the X1 Yoga. By the way, I bought it online directly from Lenovo, not Amazon. It‚Äôs now available on Amazon at a comparable price.I‚Äôve had the X1 Yoga for about 2 weeks now. It‚Äôs fantastic. It‚Äôs fast. It has the HDR, 500 NIT screen that is actually bright enough to view in sunlight, a first in all the many laptops and tablets I‚Äôve owned over the years ‚Äì I‚Äôm really old (0X47).The only issue so far is that the trackpad is bigger than I‚Äôm used to. The cursor seems to move beyond where I want it to land. Turning down the sensitivity seems to help this though.I have now added a Lenovo USB C dock allowing me to view three screens at once (counting the laptop screen) as well as using an external keyboard and mouse.Lenovo Rocks! Highly recommended!

  1. After three months of usage, there are several areas on the touchscreen that register phantom touch clicks. This results in your notebook clicking buttons and switching applications randomly.2. X1 Carbon Gen2 had a faulty Fibocom 3G adapter that froze occasionally when waking from sleep. This one has the same trouble. 5 years have passed, the problem is still there. This is an absolute lack of managing suppliers. Not only it disconnects so that the only way to reconnect is restarting the machine, but it also crushes ugly. Both the factory version and the latest version of Fibocom driver surprise you with a BSOD every other day.Imagine a Porsche assembled with duct tape and WD-40 - this is X1 Thinkpad Yoga 3rd gen.

  I have owned Thinkpads since IBM was making them and have watched as the quality of the machines degrade each year. Unfortunately, this is not just a Lenovo problem otherwise I would just buy something else. But let me give you a real world example. I just upgrade my Thinkpad T450 to this latest model the T495s.  While, it's smaller and lighter and faster, the screen, webcam, and keyboard is nowhere as good at my old T450. This screen only has about 60% sRGB cover for example, while my T450 had 96%. Sure, the newer laptops are faster but in every other respects they don't build them like the use to - as they say, but I suppose that applies to everything these days :)

  Pros: lightning fast, decently long battery at 50% brightness, silky smooth, great keyboard. Excellent feel, thin and light.Cons: noticeable learning curve for various programs/operations, but worth it.I was worried upon reading other reviews saying this laptop was unstable, and had all sorts of problems. Upon arrival the wireless worked briefly and then quit. Other reviewers threw up their hands and their single stars, but spending 5 mins downloading updated drivers (ethernet or other computer+usb stick) for the wireless yielded a fully functioning machine.Most of the installed programs are highly useful, such as a ""start"" button at the bottom of the screen, just like the old windows. Taking the time to learn read the simple directions for window management make this thing a breeze, even for upgraders from windows 7. My only hesitancy is the adaptive function keys, as I havent mastered it. I like the old f1-f12 still, but there is potential. There has been no slowdown in 1 month of useage, in contrast to other users. Too many variables to speculate how other people have problems, but having decent internet intelligence+internet protection systems will keep you virus free.This laptop's design is everything I wanted it to be. It just feels like quality, and it looks like quality, and runs like quality. The only remaining test is endurance.

  This laptop is the perfect size.  Problems I had with it upon taking it out of the box prevented me from keeping it.  Firstly, the trackpad was very twitchy.  I downloaded the latest synaptics drivers from the Lenovo site.  Upon installation, i got the blue screen of death.  At the bottom of the screen, it showed an error message with the word ""synaptics"" in there so I know they are related.  Restarted and reinstalled.  It was successful.  After about 10 minutes of use, blue screen again.  Twice in 20 minutes seems like an issue, and I'm not prepared to deal with it after spending big bucks on this laptop.  Returned for a refund.

  The laptop itself was pretty great, mainly because it was super light and had an incredible battery life, although the track pad & function keys could have been better.But the problem with the product is that it was unreliable.  The motherboard died after 16 months -- and if you look around this thread you'll see that happened to lots of other folks too.  But even worse than that, Lenovo's customer support is absolutely atrocious.  I've been waiting 5 weeks for this issue to be resolved and I'm still waiting.  I won't bore you with the details.  In the end, this company is not committed to resolving problems in an efficient and timely matter.  Which means I won't be buying their products again for a very long time.

  Amazon as usual has been great with me for all my orders. this one too without any exception was delivered with their quick 2 day shipping, free of charge ( i had to follow up once when the order status was not updated & hence got the 2 day delivery)Now coming to the product itself.I have been  using Thinkpad for 8yrs now & have been quite content with the robustness of the product as i travel a lot & at the same time the dependability, speed & system quality. Hence X1 was the only option for me.I would have loved to have a 512GB SSD HDD, unluckily it comes only with 256 GB & hence have to rationally qualify a heavy application to install on the system. Also the HDD CANNOT be expanded to a 512GB (i have got it checked with the Lenovo Service Center). When i received mine with Win 8, i was left with 218 GB.The machine came with a slightly damaged (more like a dent) near the touchpad, but since i was leaving the country could not afford to resend the device & ask for replacement.The system is SLEEK & feels like holding a few news papers together, which is a pleasant experience. The 14"" screen is sure advantage over the Asus Zenbook or Acer Aspire 13"" ultrabook models & at the same time giving a run on the weight aspect. Though slightly expensive than them, but Lenovo performance surely tops their performance. My sis owns a Zenbook & Aspire & X1 tops them with ease in every dept. except for the ""cute"" looks,  as this is pure business laptop. Go for Acer if you want looks.The touch is very responsive- the adaptive keyboard & the gesture control have been perfect to use without a glitch. Plz note in the support forums  these 2 are the most common failures/ issues reported by X1 owners. This is the link of the forum incase you would want to review:  http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/X-Series-ThinkPad-Laptops/X1-Carbon-external-display-problem-X1-to-projection-screens/td-p/1121849The system does not come pre-loaded with an Office Suite, however does come with Norton, hence would only suggest to buy the 1-3yr extension of the same.The PROBLEM i have faced with my device are - VOICE RECOGNITION (Dragon Assistant) & BLUETOOTH Disconnection. Again the next 2 highest rated failures. Which are ideally fixed pretty easily (i am going to take my sys tmw to the service center to get it repaired).Most of the applications on the sys would be old & once you try logging in, they would need to be upgraded to the latest version, which in-turn means the HDD space is utilized, which is as it minimal.The camera images are slightly grainy, but it is expected to be such from most of the Laptop cams.The touchpad has no independent left & right click button, but are integrated in the touch pad itself, which might take some time to get used. Also while typing if you are in the habit of using the function keys, you would need sometime getting used to use them also.I got a 3 yr international carry-in warranty, which is good.In all, i think its a great buy with a few easily fixable quirks, which are bound to happen in any Brand, any machine.I would be glad to be of assistance in case of queries.

  This laptop is fast! I'm running Android Studio and the Android Emulator (they totally bogged down my old laptop) with no trouble at all. The emulator loads up in a fraction of the time that it did on my Windows 7 i3 laptop. I was looking for the speediest computer that I could afford without spending money on things that I didn't want or need (touchscreen, optical drive, HDD, fingerprint detector, fancy display, and speakers -- though I might have liked a backlit keyboard). This is fitting the bill perfectly.Pros:-Fast! Boots up fast. Loads programs fast.Okays:-The screen and speakers are fine for what I'm doing. Probably not ideal for serious photo or sound editing, but fine for coding, surfing the internet, and watching youtube.-It's not lightweight, but, that being said, it feels sturdy and not cheap.Cons:-The matte finish looks nice but collects fingerprints more easily than our stainless steel refrigerator.-It's a little uncomfortable to use on your lap because the edges are very square and as I mentioned, it's not lightweight.

  This might be the one of the lightest and unbreakable laptop. Slow clap. But it has major issues1) This version, despite being priced at $2,100 (versus others priced at 1600-1800) does not have SIM slot o Micro SD slot.2) There are major heat and noise issues with the laptop. I have been getting weekly BIOS updates and none has resolved the issue.2a) When connected to charger:Using Hardware monitoring tool, I can see that even under normal usage of Office applications, the laptop is over clocking to above 3 GHz (instead of staying below, much much below even the 2.0 GHz. No amount of configuratin in BIOS or even using Intel's XTU (Extreme Tuning Utility) has resolved the over clocking.As a result, the temperate is always between 60-70C and results in fan running nearly all the time.This will also significantly reduce the life of laptop.2b) When not connected to charger,There is no over clocking (Good!) but CPU still keeps running at almost full power of 2.0 GHz and this reduces battery life to barely 4 hours (screen brightness 80).Both 2a and 2b point to crappy software by Lenovo and crappy updates that have failed to make any dent.

  Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen looks amazing. At a first glance, the sleek black lid with X1 and ThinkPad logos make quite an impression. Once you connect the power charger, a small dot in the ThinkPad logo lights off. A nice touch. And a godd thing is that fingermarks don't stick that much on the matte finish of the lid.The keyboard is the most impressive feature in this machine. I previously had an Yoga 3 Pro, with a decent keyboard. But this one is amazing. Response, height, size, it all make for the best keyboard I've ever seen in a laptop.My machine (Intel Core i7 8thGen vPro, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 10 Pro, 20KH002JUS model) starts in seconds. Faster than my old Samsung Tablet. It is so fast to start and shut off that I no longer just close the lid. I put it on Hibernate mode.Login became much faster due to the fingerprint reader as well. Just a touch in the reader and I'm logged in. One thing that my Yoga 3 Pro had, and it really bugged me, was a delay on connecting the wireless adapter. Every time I'd start the laptop - or wake it up from Hibernate - I had to wait a while for it to get the wireless on. With the X1 Carbon, it's instantaneous.Screen resolution on my old Yoga was higher than on the X1 Carbon, but that was a choice I made. The screen on the Yoga was brighter and looked better as well. You can get higher res models (mine is 1920 x 1080), but I chose the Full HD version in order to be able to connect an outside monitor without the need to adjust the resolution on the laptop screen - which also bugged me on the Yoga 3 Pro.I read some people complaining about fan noise before I settled for the X1 Carbon. When in full speed, it is noisy, but there is so much power available on the machine that it rarely goes full speed. Even running PowerBI graphs and dashboards, it rarely reaches a point when I hear the fan. When I was configuring the system, installing my stuff and things like that, I heard it. It is a bit noisy, but you will only hear it once in a while, when the processor is being highly demanded.The charger is not too big, and for those who need carry the laptop around - my case - it is not a nuisance. The whole thing - computer and charger - are light enough to travel well. And, for the daily activities you can even chose to leave the charger at home. Unless you plug a lot of stuff on the computer, the battery will last a full work day. I've been using mine for more than five hours, on and off, today and still has 46% of juice left. Not bad at all. Yoga would be at 20~25%.Touchpad is good enough and if you want, there is always the red thingy (not sure what to call it) in the middle of the keyboard. Never got used to it, even in the old days, when IBM ThinkPads had only that to move the pointer. There are three buttons, for those who like to click things, rather than just do multi finger moves on the touchpad.Over all, despite being an expensive machine, X1 Carbon is a great computer. Hope it lasts even more than my Yoga (four years and still working well, just a bit outdated). I recommend for users who need processing power and a light computer to carry around.

  Whether you use this laptop as a business or personal laptop it won't matter. The only reason you wouldn't make it your first choice as a personal laptop is the price. But if that is not an object and you demand a great laptop, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best choice. The only think I really find needed  an improvement is the Fingerprint reader, it is very slow to recognize the print. My phone fingerprint reader works 10 times better. The only other think I would like to see was more options when selecting a touchpad monitor. Yes, I would recommend this laptop.

  I have purchased lenovo laptops for years and usually add an extended warranty after purchase. These laptops do not come with a base warranty and Lenovo will not add them. This means you will not be able to extend the warranty at standard prices. You will have to pay for a ""post warranty"" which is more expensive and is only available for 1 or 2 years.

  While the computer performs well based on a couple of days of use, it is not installed with Windows 10. Instead it came with Linux Fedora. I received this on behalf of my employer, who purchased it from Amazon. We (I) would a appreciate a response from the seller to correct this issue in order for me to get same computer but with Windows 10.

  This is a 2019 product.I noticed it was a bite more slower responding then, my Lenovo Yoga 720-15IBK, that was recently stolen, and I discovered why when I upgraded the SSD to a 2TB, Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD, the SSD was a replacement after it was built by Lenovo, with a Intel brand SSD with inferior read and write speeds, from the factory Samsung manufactured SSD that is normally installed by Lenovo, now that I have the new Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD installed no more issues with slow response time.It is a great machine for the price. if you get it with the SSD Lenovo installed from the factory.Had I of known this I would have bought the one with a 512GB SSD for less money, and upgrade from that SSD.This is much lighter than the  2018 Yoga 720-15IBK.

  Beware of the seller Delca Electronics. As with other reviewers they are selling USED old models as Brand New 2020 models!Very deceiving product listing,1) this isn't the 930, it's a 700 model2) it doesn't come with a pen3) the product seemed to be opened and refurbished not ""brand new""4) sound quality is terrible audio disconnects speakers suddenly stop working and is only able to be fixed with a restart5) it blue screened and froze several times before adding any additional programs. i.e. right out of the box.I feel like the seller (who wasn't the official lenovo store but a dealer, Delca Electronics,  knowingly sold an older refurbished model. and lied on the listing.I would have returned it had I not been stationed overseas and had to take it with me.  Had to get  a last minute replacement because my laptop died, and didn't have the time to wait for another one to arrive.Beware of this seller!

  I will never buy from this company or lenovo ever again.I ordered this laptop this year and not even 5 months later the screen starts flickering when I try to return get told past return....so I try the warranty through lenovo well they take 2 months to work on it ship it back...only for a piece of paper that says they couldn't find the problem and yet my screen still flickers.If I could give negative stars I would.You would expect a 1200 dollar laptop to work but nope can't even expect that.So please reconsider your purchase.Oh and I called customer service after the fact and they hung up on me even though I was being rational with them. so yeah there's that too....SO DONE WITH LENOVO.

  I thought this was the best PC laptop out there so I went ahead and bought it. This was less than a month ago and it worked great, but two days ago it just wouldn't turn on. Tried all troubleshooting tips from Lenovo and did not solved the issue. Seller did not provide support at all and refered me to Lenovo. I was forced to go back to my old Lenovo which is still working like a charm. BEWARE!In summary, I lost all my work, wasted time and money. Now I need to return this and get a decent one.

  Overall I am satisfied. Price was good. Specs were excellent. The build quality is excellent! Little to no flex in the screen, very rigid body. The keyboard is outstanding! Best keyboard on a laptop that I have ever tried. Runs quiet, and has good battery life so far. HOWEVER, one thing I am SUPER disappointed with is the speakers. Its my understanding that these are upgrades from the Gen 6 now having some top mounted speakers in addition to the bottom firing ones. The bottom firing speaker on the right side makes a very distracting buzz. At certain frequencies it sounds like total garbage. Some blame loose shift/enter keys, some say its ""normal for a business laptop."" I'm not expecting MBP quality sound here, but I do expect it not to rattle and sound like a tin can. I want to really really love this laptop, and I intend to keep it, but the poor rattling, tiny, sound of the speaker is REALLY disappointing from a premium laptop. The sound is so poor that I turned off all system sounds because it made me cringe when i heard it.I removed the back case thinking something may have been stuck or wrong. The speaker are screwed in with some kind of vibration dampening rubber grommets isolating them from the case. The speakers are quite loose. I've considered adding a couple very small rubber washers to tighten the fit slightly to maybe cut down on the rattling sound. But haven't done anything yet.I hate to be such a downer on an otherwise fantastic laptop, but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. But overall the good things far outweigh the poor things. I'll use headphones if I intending on listening to a lot of audio.EDIT- The awful rattle continued to drive me crazy! I purchased a set of very small 1/8‚Äù rubber orings and placed them between the speaker screws and the speaker housing. It has dramatically decreased the rattle sound. I am very satisfied with this solution. Very pleased with this device now.

  At first, I thought this was a fake. I did not expect a X1 Carbon 7th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U will be this cheap. After I opened it, I checked the system information. Everything checks out. This is indeed 7th gen x1 carbon. If you check the actual Lenovo website, it's 1800 something for 256 GB SSD and $2200 for 512GB SSD. It is so light (2.5 lbs). It got a nice black and business look. 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD is all the power I want. I was thinking of getting Dell XPS 13 or this. But this is lighter than dell XPS 13, so I bought X1 instead of Dell XPS 13. I will be testing this laptop out in the next few days. If I don't like it, I will return it, but so far I love it!

  I haven't had this computer six months yet and the computer shuts down on its own and the power button blinks. If the machine isn't plugged in it shuts down and it won't start even with a full battery charge; the machine will shut down. I am beyond disappointed. This is NOT a cheap machine. Now here I am having to send it back for repairs and using insurance I had to pay for. I am without a computer to do my work. This is NOT fair.

  Upgraded from an old Yoga machine.  While this machine does not flip to tablet mode, I find that I dont really miss it.  I LOVE the anti-glare screen, great sound, fast as lightening, and the Lenovo keyboard simply cannot be bead. Overall, I really like the Thinkpad X-1 Carbon.

  When you pay for a premium ultra book, you're not looking to send it in for repairs within the first six months.  All brands have 'lemon' units -- that's understandable.  Still shakes your confidence in the brand.  Customer service was mediocre -- took too long for repairs, especially when you do everything via Zoom and can't afford the delay.  I wouldn't buy another one.

  Tl;dr: I love this laptop and wholeheartedly recommend it.I have had this laptop for 2.5 weeks now and I have really been enjoying it. The aluminum body is a bit weird for a ThinkPad, I am used to the usual black, but it feels extremely premium. Added bonus, it basically doesn't pick up fingerprints. Lenovo did remove the retractable keyboard with the 4th generation Yoga, but a perk of that is a much better and quieter keyboard. Lenovo has the best laptop keyboards. I think the Trackpoint is a little lower too, but I adapted to it quickly enough. The integrated stylus is a great feature. I have used several 2 in 1's, but this is the first one I have owned. I'm still mostly using it in laptop mode, but when I remember that I can do tablet/tent modes it's always a pleasant surprise.In reference to battery life, if I put Windows 10 in battery saver I can get around 8-10 hours on battery while working (IDEs, VMs, remote desktop, etc). Closer to 10 hours if I am just web browsing in tablet mode on the couch. Really excellent battery life for such a small laptop. Obviously more intensive tasks are going to reduce these numbers. Although I did play Minecraft for three hours with a Bluetooth controller on a recent trip and still had battery left over. The charger is a 65W USB C, this means you can also charge from a battery bank if you need more time away from a wall.Really outstanding size and weight. it weighs 2.9lbs. My last laptop was a 17"" behemoth that weighed 10lbs and had a charger that weighed about 3lbs. I always feel like my backpack is far too light and I have forgotten my laptop now. I purchased a NiDoo 13"" sleeve and it fits the Yoga like a glove and fits inside my bag rated for a 15.6"" laptop perfectly - keeps it from wiggling around. An added bonus is the sleeve has a handle and a small zippered pocket, so I also have an extremely compact bag if I just want to take my laptop and charger somewhere.I did experience a hiccup with the warranty length, but Matt at Titan Tek went above and beyond to make it right. They even gave me a refund to reflect a recent price drop, which was totally unexpected and greatly appreciated. Warranty on units sold in the future should be correct.Anyway, I highly recommend this excellent laptop if you are in the market for one.

  This Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga 4th Gen 14"" 2-in-1 is my first laptop/tablet convertible. I like it. It is very slim and not too heavy to use as a tablet. It has a very good, crisp display with colors that are bright and reflect an accurate shade of colors in pictures and digital images I've displayed. The touchscreen has worked well, and the ThinkPad Pen Pro is a nice inclusion. A regular stylus that works, for example, on an iPad, works on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga screen too. The battery charges quickly and for the kind of work I do it lasts to the end of my workday (8 hours plus with both Bluetooth and WI-FI enabled).  Overall, I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase.

  I like the thin yet very rigid frame.  I pick it up and no feeling of flexing.  The screen is nice and bright and very little edge bezel means that the foot print is about the same as my old thinkpad with 1.5"" more screen.  The SSD starts up like lighting too after being asleep.  The pen... eh... I bought a Bamboo Ink to help out.  The onboard one works well, it is just kind of tiny to hold.  Really great machine overall

  I have had this for several months now. It is replacing an X220 tablet ThinkPad and a W541.I love this machine as it has freed me from my desk and allows me to work outside on bright sunny days.This is a 10 star laptop if all you ever need is a touch pad or touch screen.But minus 2 stars because Lenovo has depreciated the TrackPoint and Buttons. There is no tactile feel anymore unless you are in perfect touch type position. This follows me around everywhere including my standing drafting table. I am rarely in touch type position.Touch pads do not work for CAD or 3D Graphics, only a 3 button mouse/trackball or a 3 button TrackPoint. Setting up a mouse or trackball are just not practical in a lot of situations away from my desk.I tried a top tier Asus laptop with an RTX 2060 GPU but returned it because of productivity  loss without a TrackPoint. Of note, the battery on the Asus lasted only about 40 minutes while doing serious 3D rendering on the battery. It is only good for spot render checks on battery and this goes for this X1 Gen 4. I am talking 4K 3D renders. If you do not know whet this is, you will get perfectly fine battery life.I purchased this with the i7-10501U. This is impressively fast rendering 3D graphics for a machine without a dedicated graphics card. About 20% the speed of my desktop which has an RTX 2060 card. This is a perfect balance between battery life and being able to do spot renders. I always use this unplugged away from my desk so battery life is important. I run the screen at 3/4 brightness indoors at 1080 resolution and is bright enough when I bring my work outside to the park and work in the sunlight. I do have the 500 NIT screen. The battery always indicates 4 to 5 hours in real use but I get way more. This seems to eat lots of power in sleep mode throughout the day or overnight so I just power off or hibernate for any long periods. Boot up is about 20 seconds using the finger print recognition. Awesome!I have not made made any use of the stylus but it does work OK using Krita. Touch screen response is excellent when reading documents in tablet mode. All my CAD requires precise numerical input and I find that my finger or stylus is always blocking something half the time. The TrackPoint is the most productive feature of any Lenovo product for me.

  Just got this beautiful piece of art from Niya Goods (Supplier) with just 1489 USD (normally it should be around 1700 USD when I bought it). In terms of looks and build quality, it is peerless. The keyboard was a bit tough to use at first since I changed from a full keyboard, but nevertheless the keyboard is top tier. The laptop comes with a 135W battery, which is plenty for a Thinkpad. But the plug is not suitable for my country of residence so I might need an adapter eventually (which is nothing to do with the laptop).The FAN NOISE, in the beginning, was quite loud and turned on and off frequently when the PC is in the ""Best Performance"" mode. But choosing the ""Best Battery Life"" mode solved the issue (which is not cool). But after upgrading the firmware, I feel like it decreased a bit (at best performance), or I might have gotten used to it.There are some bugs (or any other issue) with the software. The PC hangs sometimes. Maybe it is the issue with the particular device I got. And this problem might be solved by resetting the windows.(Update: It was fixed after I updated some drivers from Lenovo and Microsoft)The screen is quite bright and of higher quality (than my previously used HP Pavilion 2018) even though I bought the lowest option.The sound quality would have been excellent if the soundbox was placed on the top. The sound gets smothered a bit since the soundboxes are located below the chassis.The WiFi chip can support up to AX or the latest version. But in order to utilize its full potential, the router must be AX as well, otherwise, the quality will go down to the router version.All other specs as mentioned in the description matches perfectly with the device I got, and I am quite happy with my new laptop.

  Despite its ample raw specifications this machine has been causing me grief since the day I got it.‚Ä¢ Sluggish day-to-day operation I'd expect from an entry-level machine, Despite 8GB RAM and 2 Samsung SSDs: Glitches and annoying little pauses abound when switching tabs and windows; video playback gets glitchy, especially on YouTube; whole computer becomes unresponsive when external HDD spins up.‚Ä¢ Doesn't always sleep when I close the lid. Today it overheated in its case; choking on its own hot exhaust; now fan won't stop spinning at full RPMs (annoyingly loud).‚Ä¢ Bluetooth can't keep a connection and occasionally the hardware disappears entirely from device manager.‚Ä¢ USB 'dedicated charging port' on rear repeatedly connects and disconnects phone when computer is on‚Ä¢ Audio functions appear on both dedicated keys as well as on fn keys. What a waste of four function keys; so many other functions I could have used!‚Ä¢ The touchpad and trackpoint controller are among the worst I've ever used. TrackPoint used to be my favorite control method. Not on this machine.‚Ä¢ I thought the keyboard would have the textured keys I'm used to but mine shipped with smooth keys, which don't feel as nice.I though for sure there was a hardware problem so I took the machine in for repair as soon as I could in Manhattan. Presumably they changed the motherboard and keyboard but all the symptoms persist until this day..Yes, I am up-to-date with drivers, BIOS, etc.Yes, all my settings are as they should be.So disappointed. I really hope Lenovo steps up on this one because I've got myself a lemon, here.#buyersremorse

  This machine is a great work horse. It has lots of power per dollar and is built well. However, the 500 GB 7200 RPM makes this system drag. I upgraded to an SSD right away. Now it screams! I am a power user and I video edit with Adobe Primere and Record with Pro Tools 12.5. It handles these tasks well. If you a power user like me on a budget and you want future upgrade ability. This system might fit the bill for you.

  Great business class laptop. Fast and reliable. Very durable. Perfect size for productivity in my opinion. I need to have a num pad makes life a lot easier when you rely on this for work. Battery life is very good use this a lot for autocad. I did upgrade the ram and put an SSD in it which made a huge difference. I put the RAM and SSD in myself to save money.

  Bought 2 for my team recently. Having used myself for a long time I knew Thinkpads are built for software developers in mind but how easy it is going to be to upgrade I had no idea till I opened the back cover. As soon as you open back cover you see all (two) slots for the RAM are available (since machine has 2 slots under the keyboard - factory installed RAM used those slots which was very smart idea imo). Same thing with SSD/HDD. There is a slot left open for you to upgrade. You can put 2.5"" (classic) SSD or use same spot for (up to) 2 M.2 SSDs. Do not forget to buy casing for M.2 SSD if you are planning to add M.2I bought 2x16GB RAM, and 1 TB M.2 SSD .. With one slot still available for future M.2 SSD .. As you know thunderbolt can support up to 4 monitors or an external video card supporting 4K monitors .. This laptop is built to serve you for a really long time! A wonderful piece of hardware .. Awesome job on Lenovo's end.

  Excellent machine.With good construction, good specs, I have been using it for 6 months, and it has not dissapointed me.Very powerful machine, the best thinkpad for now, still not like the ones in the past.The only problem I found was the touchpad does not allow me to move the mouse when I am using the keyboard, it requires me to stop presing the keyboard for some couple of second to be able to use the mouse, that is really annoying, because I use that for certain applications.

  Lightweight and easy to carry. I like that the battery is removable and swapable without removing screws like newer, slimmer laptops. Good for travel and most airports and hotel rooms have charging points. Currently using it as a backup computer as my other laptop is more than 8 years old.

  If you are looking for a Thinkpad P50 this is configuration to get - the base model. The laptop has easy access to the hard drive and ram so you can upgrade it yourself for much cheaper.I had Thinkpads in the past and currently have a Retina MBP. I decided to come back to Thinkpads since they are a bit cheaper and much more upgradable. The fit and finish of my Macbook Pro is better but the build quality of this P50 is still very good. The P50 however is much bulkier than a 15in Macbook Pro.Heres why i choose this P50:Screen: The FHD screen is IPS and has good color and view angles. I prefer this to the 4k option because of increased battery life and no issues with scaling.Ram: 8GB is ok. The laptop has 4 slots 2 under the keyboard and 2 under the back panel. The back panel is pretty easy to access and you can upgrade to 64GB of ram (16x4)Hard Drive: The included disk is slow. You will want to upgrade to your own SSD. This laptop can take 2x NVME and 1x 2.5in drives or 2 x 2.5in. If you get an ssd thats a 2.5in just drop in place of the existing hard drive and you are ready to go. However if you want to add an NVME or another 2.5 drive you will need to buy an adapter which is annoying. I swapped in an 256GB ssd I had around and it was noticeably better than the spinning disk.Graphics: You get two options with the P50 the M1000M or M2000M. This has the M1000M which is marginally slower but I don't really game or do anything graphics intensive.OS: I was initially hoping to run linux on this but I read about some compatibility issues. I settled on running Windows 10. If you also run Windows 10 make sure to turn off the MS snooping features. Don't use express settings.Overall I'm pretty happy this P50. Solid build quality and runs pretty quickly after you upgrade the Ram/SSD. The only complaints I have are the non center keyboard (they should drop the num pad) and the need for adapters for adding hard drives.

  As title, it's very quiet, runs great with the ThinkPad thunderbolt 3 docking station. However, even with that combo (w docking station), it is still NOT powerful enough to drive dual 4K monitors, simply because it does not have a powerful GPU. I mean you can run it, but the performance would be sluggish. So if you are buying this laptop for video editing and/or web design purposes, you might want to think twice. Otherwise, for ""general"" purpose it is a good choice.

  I've had this laptop for 3 months now, so here goes nothing.Pros: excellent machine. It's super fast, easily keeps its framerates up without trying, has a battery life unlike any laptop I've owned before, and honestly it has just enough of that ""gamer aesthetic"" to look cool without looking like Megatron's codpiece like most other gaming laptops these days.Cons: the built-in monitor is a 60Hz display, so your framerates aren't going higher despite it easily having the spare power to do so with a better monitorThe legion logo on the back of the screen that lights up cannot be turned off, so if you play in a dark room and prefer doing so, prepare to have a beacon in the middle of your room.It's kind of a nitpick, but the soft touch material picks up oils from your skin and smudges really easily. It's not hard to clean, but it does make me add a step of ""wipe this thing down"" before packing it up to go to a friend's house, which is a minor annoyance.And now for the only real problem I have with it. It severely limits how much power the GPU can use if it's on battery. I'll be at a static 60 frames, and checking my stats, the GPU isn't taxed AT ALL with a handful of modern games, but then if the computer becomes unplugged, it locks the screen at 30 frames per second. I can tell that it doesn't seem limited to games either, because something seems slightly off with my otherwise vibrant display when it's unplugged, but I know it hadn't dimmed or anything. So if you're not near an outlet, you're not gaming (it's honestly a nightmare in competitive games). This has me concerned about the longevity of the computer's battery, because keeping it plugged in can't be good for it.

  Will update as I learn more about the computerUPDATE 1: I have had this computer now for only two days, overall it's been a fairly nice two days. Didn't go as smoothly as I was starting it up for the first time. When I was setting my new password for some reason the ""5"" key on the numpad was not working, however it is miraculously working now. Also after noticing there was an update, I updated the laptop and when it was booting back up, after the log on screen it was just a black screen that wouldn't go away. I shut it off two times with no progress. However, after shutting off the laptop for the third time I decided to remove the Mouse usb, when I turned it back on it went back to normal and started as if nothing happened. It hasn't happened again. So that was a bit of a setback. Besides that, I've been having a smooth experience with the laptop. It's pretty fast. I will test the gaming aspect some time soon.UPDATE 2: I've had the laptop for a few months now, it's working very smoothly, it's fast when starting up, and I've had no major issues. I haven't tried playing any newer 'heavy' games but the witcher 2, LA NOIRE, murdered soul suspect, maple story, and skyrim run extremely well on it. I also use a drawing tablet on the laptop and I haven't had any issues with that either. It runs good. I just started the new college semester so I'm going to be using the laptop more frequently and I'll be using programs like Visual Studio and Autopsy so I'll update again soon!

  The short version is that this is by FAR the best laptop I have ever owned.But to give some context: I am a middle aged working mom who primarily wants a good laptop because I am impatient with lag and because I take a billion pictures. BUT, I do play World of Warcraft once or twice a week so whatever laptop I use needs to be gaming quality.  My oldest son just (last week!) graduated from Full Sail University with his BS in Game Design so he is obviously a very heavy gamer.  He's home right now for the holidays and I had him give this beauty a good test drive overnight, trying it on WoW and on some Steam games he plays.  Both of us LOVE it and my son proclaims it better than his Full Sail laptop.I LOVE:+ GREAT graphics. I can have WoW set to the max graphics and it looks amazing.+ SUPER fast processing - everything, every game, every site, everything loads in a blink. WOW what a pleasure.+ I love the keys. They are slightly elevated and have, I don't know how to say it, good differentiation between them. What this means for me is far fewer typos as my fingers seem to find the right keys unerringly.  Also the keyboard can be set to be backlit, which I like.+ Great storage. 1 TB which is enough for all my pictures!+ 3 USB ports, also an HDMI port+ The power cord is in the back which I think is brilliant! I hate side mounted power outlets because what if it doesn't fit your set up (what if your power cord is on the left and where you sit the wall outlet is on your right)-- then you have to drape the cord around you and it's irritating.+ Slim, light (5 pounds!), and quietGAMER SON LOVES:- Easily handles 60 FPS at maxed our graphics- Runs several programs jointly with no slow down or fan use- 1 TB of available storage  perfect for storing games- Sound speakers can play extremely loud- Multiple USB ports for gaming BOTTOM LINE: Powerful, beautiful, lightning quick, and a TB of storage. LOVE LOVE LOVE!Note: The specs are well documented on the product page which is why I don't list them in detail but in short: Intel Core i7 8th gen processor, 15.6"" screen, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics,  RAM 16 GB DDR4, 1000 GB Hybrid Drive

  After two weeks with the product I can really enjoy what was given. Smooth graphics for gaming, battery life is just as expected of 4 hours when put to full use but minor things allow it to last longer. Heatingbisnt an issue due to lots of events but just for safe measure to keep it from over working I place a fan on it to help remove the heat faster.It will get loud with the fan when it's over working if your interested into things such as that but over its a great product and I have reached no faults as of yet.

  This is a worthy competitor of Surface Pro 6, even SP 7. Especially at 1100 dollars (itreplay seller) for i7 model, which is also the current price of SP6 i7 model with no Thunderbolts 3 and smaller SSD. As a designer, I've been using Windows tablets since the late 90s. This is a replacement for 3 years old Surface Pro 4.Pros:- Just like Surface Pro but bigger screen and higher resolution.- Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means you can use eGPU.- Solid keyboard, better than SP keyboard.Cons:- Screen scratch issue: This is a known issue for all X1 Tablet users. You'll need a screen protector that is not included. Most people use Photodon brand.- Battery life is very short, it is the worse I've seen. It lasts a little over 4 hours for drawing. It'll be much shorter when battery gets older.- Unlike the OS on SP which is a optimized Win10 for SP. X1's Win10 is OEM one that is full of bloatware and takes up 3GB RAM just to boot it.- The pen is not the one shown in the images, it's the older generation with a hard plastic tip that makes drawing on glass like skating on ice, not good.Interestingly it doesn't come in retail box, at least not the US retail box. It comes in brow box with Lenovo seal, it also comes with a big protector case which I wasn't expecting it. Mine was manufactured in July 2018, it took almost an hour to update all the Windows and Lenovo's patches.Mine is slightly defective, upper right bezel area is separated from the external frame. It makes clicking noise when pressed as the glass flexes. So check yours before spent hour updating OS.

  I really liked this tablet. As opposed to the options available from Lenovo themselves, this has the perfect balance of storage, processing power, and RAM that I can use. How do more people not know about this? I know so many people that went with the mainstream version of this form factor (without the Thunderbolt 3 and other wonderful features) and would have gone with this one in a heartbeat if they knew that this existed!Likes: - Thunderbolt 3 ports!!!!! I can plug in an external GPU or anything that uses USB C or a docking station or whatever! I love this inclusion in the form factor when the competition doesn't have enough sense to do the same. - The battery life really does depend on your usage, but I've been able to get a full day out of it with no sweat. If you need to extend your battery life then one investment to make is a 45W battery pack that can charge this tablet via USB PD. - The screen is bright and sharp and it's very responsive to touch. - The keyboard is as nice as you'd expect from a ThinkPad Product, but is a little bit shallower in comparison to the other ThinkPad laptops. - The kickstand works flawlessly and reversing the keyboard allows for use in my lap easily.Dislikes: - The pen that came with it was not very good and did not have Bluetooth functionality, but at this price when comparing to the competition I could get the Bamboo Ink stylus and it works very well.

  Great product, the only thing I would change is the the pen attachment. I like how some of the competition has the magnet on the side and the pen attaches like that, on this one the attachment comes out easily.

  I'm about a month in with this guy. Absolutely love it so far! I like that it's lightweight. I got really sick of carrying a great big laptop around. The tablet mode is awesome.

  I bought this computer as a design and business driver and I'm thoroughly impressed. It says it has 8gb ram on the product but actually has 16gb ram which was a pleasant surprise. It's very fast and powerful. Very easy to use with lots of features. The pen is okay and could be better but is still a great addition. Its portability and speed allows me to better portray ideas and possibilities to clients better than trying to just explain it to them. The display is also very good. I've heard a lot about how the speakers could be better but personally I think they are pretty good. Of course you probably won't be able to hear them in louder settings but why wouldn't you just use headphones in those situations on any device. The keyboard is probably one of the best features because of how comfortable and tactile it is. I would have bought this computer sooner if I would have found it sooner. Great buy!

  Great keyboard good screen alright speakers the mouse pad gesture are handy when you get used to it . Pen and tablet mode work fine ,maybe just a bit of a hassle having to open your on screen keyboard manually most of the time . But over great for typical  computer users who are always next to a outlet or have a fat power pack because battery life Is like 6 hrs max with energy saver on so yea be prepared for that. Other than that  great computer and has a thunderbolt usbc you can always get a external gpu to boost its graphics. I‚Äôd buy it again and probably will down the line but as a current student the battery was a big deal breaker.

  I just purchased this and it came with a case that was an unexpected surprise since it was not mentioned in the product description. Fast forward to trying to use the case. I and my husband, who is pretty handy with these kinds of things have spent over an hour trying to get the case open and operational. Since we are nowhere near successful yet, I can't comment on the laptop - haven't used it since we've spent all our time trying to open the seemingly useless case!

  The laptop I received clearly had the shell opened and was not completely snapped in place.  All of the screws on the shell were loose with a couple about to fall out.  Fortunately I was able to secure them before they were lost.  The laptop was in working order and did have all the specifications as advertised but I suspect aftermarket RAM and maybe a hard drive was changed.

  I needed a new laptop for school.  After doing some research and talking to classmates, I selected the Lenovo ThinkPad.  I then compared models on the Lenovo website and the 20QD0007US met my needs.  I needed a fast CPU, 16GB of memory and a 500GB SSD.  This model met my needs.  After we got it, the customization of Windows was easy.  I also found it easy to get my Office package installed.  The final change was to reduce the size of the Windows partition and install Linux along with it.  All pretty straight forward.  So far things are great.My only ""issue"" was with the delivery.  It was shipped via UPS with a signature required.  That sounds logical.  However, for whatever reason, the UPS driver decided to skip my house and just mark the delivery as ""no one home"".  Well, I was home all day and no UPS driver.  I had to drive to a UPS Store the next day to pick it up.

  I have lost any confidence I had left in the Lenovo brand. This machine demonstrated failure after just 35 days of ownership. I was in class one evening, following along with the professor lecture and PP slides, when the X1 made 6 loud beeps that disrupted the class. The machine was not even in sleep mode, the display had only turned off through the system settings to save power. I apologized and walked out of class with it and attempted to start it in the hallway about 4 times. Each time I tried a hard reset and held the power button down for about 30 seconds to make sure the machine was completely off. Each time it gave the beep errors. When I went home, it powered on properly, and when I let the display go to sleep and woke it up again, I encountered the same error.This is similar to an issue I had with Lenovo's T61P about 8 years ago or so. I had sent that machine in for repair and it failed again a year later. I wanted to give Lenovo the benefit of the doubt, since Nvidia reported a defective batch of 570m video cards that were in the T61P, but that was a mistake. After two failing machine from Lenovo, I can safely say that I am completely done with their products.I will mention the good and bad attributes of the machine when it actually worked for most of the month.What I liked:Build<-- It was super light, yet felt very solid and well built on the outside. I did not have any issues with peeling of the paint, and the carbon fiber weave design is quite nice.Screen Quality <-- Excellent, the screen is brighter and more vivid than my 2018 MacBook Pro's screen. The resolution is also higher, but with a 14in screen, the difference in clarity isn't noticeable.Speakers <-- Pretty good, though there is not much bass. It is better than most other Thinkpad models, but not nearly as good as the MBP's.Keyboard <-- Far better than my MBP's, good key travel and feedback. The difference is highly noticeable between the two machines. I did not have any issues with the layout, which some people have discussed, though I am unsure of why.Thinkshutter <-- This is a nice built in feature that I would like for more notebooks to have. You can purchase little covers on Amazon that stick to the screen or bezel and perform the same way.What I did NOT like:Speed <-- It was not as quick as I would have liked when compiling code in IntelliJ. Also, 4K video playback was choppy in fullscreen. I know that the CPU is under-volted to save battery life, but this is pretty unacceptable if Lenovo is offering this machine with a 4K screen.Trackpad/ Trackpoint <-- I have no clue why the trackpad leaves little eraser like particles on the surface after little use. It certainly was not from my skin. Other users on Reddit reported the same issue, while some stated that the surface was smooth glass and had no issues. On the X1C I had, the surface was rather rough. The Trackpoint is too recessed into the keyboard, the T430 at my job is far better and the last generation of the X1 apparently did not have this issue. Lenovo wants to focus too much on making the machine slimmer. Companies including Apple, need to stop this trend if they compromise important functions.Battery <-- The battery would last 3-4 hours maximum with 75-100% screen brightness. With a screen of this resolution, poor battery life is expected, but it is still a disadvantage.Quality <-- The system gave off 6 loud beeps, which I believe indicates a ""Computer display error"" according to another user on Lenovo's forums who had a similar issue. They had to have a new system board ordered, so I assume that something related to the integrated graphics is failing.Also, I immediately noticed two dead pixels on the screen and contacted the reseller to notify them of the issue. I chose to keep it because these machines can have other issues, and there was not any other defects.Overall, I give this machine two stars. The construction of the machine is solid and the keyboard and screen are good, but what good is it, if it fails when I need it the most? You can try your luck with this machine since so many other folks have reported that Thinkpads are ""workhorses"" and ""reliable"". I do not doubt their positive experience. However, my experience is what dictates how a spend my money, and Lenovo will not get anymore money from me.Thanks to Amazon for giving me the rest of the refund.

  This laptop is pure trash! I would highly recommend never to buy a product from lenovo, their customer service is garbage too. Had this lap top for over a year, ive sent it in to be fixed so many times I've lost count. Started with the finger print scanner it stopped working withing 30 days of purchase, then the speakers go out, then the camera, then the screen started coming apart...I could go on...anyways do yourself a favor and don't waste your money. Oh and the customer service, they answer the phone when they feel like it (answer the phone and not say anything or even just answer and they hang up immediately) takes about 3-5 calls to get someone to actually answer

  I found having a 2-in-1 laptop a great idea. Unfortunately the quality is very bad and the company seems to be a mess. The laptop's speaker did not work from the beginning. After sending it to Lenovo for repair, I received it back, the speaker worked but the sound is horribly scratchy. You cannot listen to songs or watch a movie on it ... The US customer service is really bad. So is the repair staff quality; I already sent the laptop in twice and am now sending it again. Worst equipment I ever bought ...

  Very important!  The i7 version of X1 Yoga comes with a 2k resolution screen.  You might think that won't make a difference and buy an i5 with 1080p instead.  However, the 2k screen is much more crisp with tinier pixels.  Keep that in mind if you can't decide.

  I rarely write reviews but was so disappointed in this product that I felt compelled to. I bought this laptop 4 months ago and after normal use the laptop is already breaking. The screen became loose and the glue that was used to keep the screen cover on started peeling off. I can no longer open or close the laptop without it breaking even further.  I did not drop or mishandle the laptop in anyway. I tried calling both Amazon and Lenovo and they were both unhelpful. I can't believe a laptop with this price would be so cheaply made.

  Strongly recommend a different laptop. The hinges are held in using glue on the LCD plastic without a metal backing, causing the glue to breakdown and eventually for that area to snap. Happened to me after six months of owning the laptop. The laptop is opened/closed about 2 to 3 times per day. Called for warranty support, Lenovo stated it's 'accidental damage' and won't cover it. Hinge design is defective. Search Google for 'Legion 7 hinge' and you'll see plenty of people complaining about the same issue. About 80% of the reports are problems with the R-side hinge. It's a manufacturing defect but won't be covered under warranty. Strongly recommend against purchasing this laptop.

  I use Solidworks, heavily, and needed to upgrade to a machine that could handle VERY large assemblies. This thing is the fastest laptop I have ever seen with Solidworks! Incredible graphics too!

  I did buy this laptop (ultrabook) which arrived sooner than expected, delivered by DHL. Unpacking was easy. It was partially charged. I did branch it and it was fully charged very quickly. Initial windows configuration was rather fast. I installed only a few programs, such as Microsoft Office and few additional ones related to my work.1. Battery life: I am really impressed with the battery life of this computer. After two days of installing software and dealing with minor configuration adjustments, I charged it completely and I left it playing YouTube music non-stop, after changing power & sleep configuration to leave it functioning with no interruption. The computer played YouTube during 10:30 hours. I was really impressed. The I charged it completely in the next day. It took 1:40 h to be completely charged, Awesome.2. Display: I am maybe somewhat naif, but I have never had a display experience such as with this computer. It gives you a sort of a '3D image'. Incredible. I showed it to my wife to be sure of what I was seeing, and she told me she had the same perception as well. Very nice. YouTube good recordings have an excellent resolution on screen.3. Keyboard: although the layout of the keyboard is a 'classical' LeNovo layout, its touching is really smooth, with a kind of a rubbering sensation at the fingers. Typing is very responsive. The only thing I didn't like is that LeNovo switched the positions of Ctrl and Fn keys. In my previous (still in use and very good) LeNovo Flex 5, the position of these two keys are inverted. Why LeNovo did this?4. Touchpad: the touchpad is incredibly responsive as well. Smooth and pleasant to touch. However, be aware to have clean hands before using the computer. After a few days, the touchpad had a greasy spot in it which is not easy to clean. This is maybe of my fault.5. Web browsing: I don't like Microsoft Edge very much (although I have to try it again). Therefore, I downloaded and installed Chrome. Browsing the web with Chrome is very fast.6. USB ports: the ultrabook has two USB ports. Transferring a folder of 62.2 Gb with 304 movie files from a Toshiba Canvio Connect II 1TB Portable Hard Drive to the ultrabook took 8 min. 23 sec.. Transferring back from the ultrabook to the external hard disk took 15 min. 33 sec. I also installed and connected an EPSON L3150 printer to the ultrabook. Printing just work fine.7. HDMI port: I did connect a LG external screen through the HDMI port, and it did work fine as well.8. Wireless mouse: I did connect a wireless mouse through one of the USB ports, and it did work very well.9. Internet connection: I did a test with an internet speed of 24.85 Mbps for download and 6.00 Mbps for upload. I downloaded a 12 Gb folder with documents from Dropbox, and it took 44 min 46 sec. I then uploaded a folder of 60.7 Gb to the transfer file website WeTransfer, and it took 3 min 00 sec. Streaming connection and playing was very fast.Starting the computer with the digital recognition is perfect.The ultrabook has one drawback in my opinion: the on/off button on the right side is a bit small and needs to be seen, at least to me.My overall experience with this ultrabook after 4 days of use is that it is extremely good. Congratulations to LeNovo for building a state-of-art ultrabook, which is very light in weight. They could provide a protecting case for the ultrabook, though, considering its price. It would have been a nice purchase gift. Nevertheless, the computer is worth its price. Hopefully the battery life will remain somewhat constant for over a year. My last laptop (LeNovo Flex 5) lost maybe half of its battery life after one year.

  The computer did not work out of the package.  It would not connect to the internet.  Spent hours trying.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!  Do not buy from this seller!!!!  I have submitted this review three times.  The seller in the meantime asked me to remove the negative review after I reached out to Amazon about being charged $132 restocking fee.  The seller said it was for the cardboard container on the laptop.  Seriously.  I checked the seller ratings before I bought this laptop to decide which one to buy. I think other people do too and the reviews should reflect the actual product and purchase experience. In my experience the laptop would not work it would not connect to the Internet. I had two other laptops open connected to the Internet. I downloaded and watched a Lenovo set-up video. I did troubleshooting. I contacted my Internet provider to make sure that I had the right password. It would not connect. I was excited about this laptop. This was a big expenditure for me. And the last thing I wanted to do was to have to go to to a crowded UPS store in the middle of a pandemic.

  started out ok.  Then the external mouse wouldn't work, then the attached full size keyboard. Then the touchpad didn't work, then the keyboard on the computer didn't. OK, I have had issues before with other computers.so contact Lenovo support.a misnomer if ever there was one. step thru the automated phone system, listen to how great & dedicated they are, end up with a click and silence. Did this thrice. the sounds of silence.When you're buying a product, the support that purportedly comes with it is a large part of ""product"". this doesn't measure up.

  This Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon computer was purchased to meet the requirements for my kid who is an engineering student. It is powerful, light-weighted, and has plenty of of RAM and SSD size. Especially, the keyboard is excellent, superior to all other previous computer keyboards. So far so good!

  I use this for my office computer.  I use an external screen and a keyboard, and it performs very well.

  After leaving my tech job and turning in my i5 Lenovo I wanted a new work laptop for future remote work.  This is incredibly light and sturdy - not at all bendy.  While doing technical/business work, Visual Studio, email, Ubunto wsl, etc. this laptop's battery runs for more than 10 hours with no problems.  Keyboard, trackpad, and panel are all top notch.  Very happy with it.

  Lenovo has always been my vendor of choice. I was having issues getting laptops built in the factory and shipped in a timely manner. I found these laptops with the exact specs I needed and had them in hand in just a couple days. Great vendor and great product.
