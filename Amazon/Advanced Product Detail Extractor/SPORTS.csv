  I absolutely love this band.  It has gotten softer the more I wear it and is so easy to get on and off.  I generally use the band my fitbit came with for work outs, kayaking, riding horses etc., so it is important that attachment and removal is quick and easy.  Looks great with any outfit and makes my fitbit look more stylish for dresser events (because I am addicted and MUST wear it all the time!).  Buy the band, you won't regret it.

  I've had it for about a month, it's not my only band and the rose gold is wearing off.  It looks cheap and junky.

  I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews here, I am happy with the band. I previously bought a cheap knockoff that was terribly made, and this is much, much nicer (of course, considering the price, it should be good). I haven't had any problems with rashes or the clasp as others mentioned...

  Excellent quality. I am so glad I found this cute, white afforable one that is an actual fitbit. It was on sale. I didn't want something cheap and lose my fitbit watch like I've read from a lot of reviews of off brand bands. I am very happy.

  I bought a Fitbit brand strap because I assumed it would be decent quality and properly sized and configured.I do not recommend buying this strap -- I can't make it fit onto the fitbit inspire hr device.The pin on the long strap doesn't grab and stay fitted into the device and so the strap can't be secured to it -- it appears that the pin may not be the right size or shape. The pin on this strap seems thinner and less substantial than the pin on the original strap.

  I got the Alta HR in black and decided I wanted another color. All of the off brands tend to break or the colors rub off in less than a month (according to the photos and reviews). So I forked out the cash for the blue/grey band and loved it. It's perfect and durable. Annnnnnd now I'm buying the coral! üòãüòç Worth the money for quality and durability.

  My original Alta band broke and I needed a replacement. I did some research because I didn't want to have one break again. I didn't want to buy an off brand because so many people said they didn't last. This band is amazing! So much better than the original. The first one constantly came unsnapped and this one is easier to adjust comfortably. Might have to buy more colors!

  My band broke less than four months after purchase, and Fitbit's warranty does not apply.  Their customer service department explained to me that they only support items purchased through their online store.  This appeared to be a genuine, licensed Fitbit product, but I guess that doesn't matter.

  The clasps that attach to the Fitbit loosen over time, pinch my skin and detach. I bought this band in February and it already needs to be replaced. Lasted 7 months! That‚Äôs it??! I had the same issue with the band that came with my Fitbit. However, the off brand bands last longer?? Very disappointing!!! The only plus is the strap that holds the end of the band to the other has not stretched. I wish I could get my money back.

  This band was great for 9 months...until the plastic connectors broke.  I am so frustrated with FitBit bands.  I bought the FitBit Alta HR because I have had 2 FitBit Charge trackers and the bands bubbled up and eventually broke on both of them.  I thought a changeable band would make he tracker last longer.  Well, it did, but now I have to buy a new band every 6-9 months.  I would love for there be a quality product that lasts.

  This is a very unreliable tracker and a very poor-quality product.Compared to other, more reliable devices:- The Fitbit Alta HR miscalculates the number of steps taken (for instance, it counts thousands of steps for an hour spent speaking while sitting, or for an hour driving on dirt roads)- The Fitbit Alta HR overestimates calories burned by 25-30% (even after discounting extra steps)- The Fitbit Alta HR‚Äôs heart rate tracking is completely off and, therefore, so is the sleep tracking & the exercise tracking- The Fitbit Alta HR does not recognize many common forms of exercise (like most martial arts).In addition, the Fitbit Alta HR is poorly built. The device I bought stopped working after 6 months. [Update: Fitbit sent me a replacement product, which  stopped working after less than five months].Customer service is terrible:- replacement for products under warranty take weeks to arrive (minimum ‚Äú5 to 10 business days‚Äù)- Fitbit replaces defective products not with brand new items, but with refurbished pebbles (which won‚Äôt last very long, given that even brand-new products break down after 6 months)- The warranty on the replacement items is only for the duration of the warranty left on the original product, rather than a new one-year warranty, which is standard practice for other companies. (this show the very poor confidence Fitbit employees have in their own products!)- It takes days to receive answers from customer support.- There is no compensation for customers who have to deal with defective products. Not even an apology.Overall, Fitbit‚Äôs policies are excellent at protecting themselves against the poor quality of their own products, but they are much less effective at protecting the rights of their customers.The only good thing I can write about this product is that the Fitbit Alta HR is discreet and relatively elegant, and it gives the time accurately.But given that that this tracker fails to perform appropriately all of the basic functions for which we may decide to buy it, including step tracking, heart rate tracking, and calorie tracking, we‚Äôre be better off with no device at all (more discreet), a standard watch (more elegant), or a tracker from another brand like Garmin or Omron (more accurate).

  This is a good replacement band from Fitbit. The corral color is not too orange which I was afraid of so I'm happy about it. These never last me too long but so far so good with this replacement. The coral has maintained it's color and cleaned easily. I don't have super small wrists but the small fits good on this. Now and again I think some water gets under it and my skin gets irritated. My only issue with these is the design not I suspect the newer trackers are better.

  I like the Fitbit and the band but The band keeps coming off. This is my second band on the Fitbit and doing the same thing (last one ordered May18, 2018 through Amazon. At $28 a pop, this isn‚Äôt cost effective. I may try a cheaper brand to see if it is any better. Luckily I haven‚Äôt lost the Fitbit but it‚Äôs scratched from falling on the ground when band suddenly pops off.

  After owning my fitbit for a year, the clasp started getting a little loose, endangering my whole fitbit of falling off. This little guy fixes that problem right away. It's inexpensive, so I don't mind replacing the part every year or so in exchange for an awesome product.

  This clasp fits my fit bit flex perfectly. It was a little bit difficult to fit in the first couple times that I clasped it in, however now it fits in easily and snuggly. It holds the band closed firmly and does not irritate my wrist.If you've lost your clasp as I did this is the way to go rather than buying a whole new band.

0,SPORTS,Fitbit,"Fitbit Flex 2 Accessory 3 Piece Pack, Pink, Large, 0.13 Pound",$6.52,2.0,"
  I love my Fitbit flex because it's not big and bulky.  I'm not big on jewelry, so the thinner, flat design is good.  The different band colors are great for mixing up colors.  I think it is SOOOO cheap of Fitbit to market a 3 pack of bands with one clasp.  The generic, aftermarket brands use watch clasps which makes them unattractive.  I was happy to pay for the brand name at $10/band or $30 for a 3 pack.  For that amount, each band should have a clasp with it.  The clasps are very difficult to remove because they are supposed to stay in place.  So the bottom line, Fitbit produces 1/3 of the cheap clasps, saves themselves money, but still sticks it to the consumer with a high-priced 3 pack to buy their product.  It states it in the description there is one clasp, but it's still really, really bad business.  Consumers will pay for the brand name.  Don't be so cheap that each bracelet isn't ready to be used with its own clasp.  It takes enough time slipping the Fitbit in and out of the band.  Really, really disappointed in Fitbit sticking it to the consumer.

  These Fitbit bands actually from Fitbit are better than all of the other non-Fitbit brand bands that are available. They are more pliable, fit to your wrist better and more secure.  That said - come on Fitbit, add clasps for all the bands.  You are selling 3 bands but only 1 clasp.  That means you are selling 1 band and 2 almost bands!  Fitbit, you are better than that.  For almost $30, you should get 3 clasps!

  Like having the additional Flex 2 bands in case my original one does not hold up to the pool chemicals (still TBD).  Wish the pack would have included three metal clasps instead of only one.  Not sure this was clear in the product specs but I may have missed it.

  I like this three pack of bands however I find it ridiculous that they only include one snap. How much could it realistically cost fitbit to include one for each band? Also, comparing the bands to the one that came with my fitbit these all are slightly shorter as well as slightly more narrow.
"
0,SPORTS,Fitbit,"Fitbit Flex 2 Accessory 3 Piece Pack, Pink, Large, 0.13 Pound",$6.52,4.0,"
  Really??  Just one clasp for three bands?!  Even the cheaper knockoffs give you a clasp for *each* bracelet.  The fitbit bands are a little smaller in profile than the knockoffs, which is why I ordered them.  And they are a little bit more pliable.  But c'mon, fitbit - just one clasp for three bands is pretty stingy.  If you really want the slightly smaller band, then go for it.  But if close cuts it, save yourself some broken fingernails (those suckers are *hard* to get out and put back in!), and get the perfectly acceptable cheaper versions that have a clasp for each bracelet.

  I love fitbit and was so disappointed with the choice to only provide one clasp.  it was so difficult to remove and insert in the different bracelet. Broke 2 nails and tried using a towel and other items.  In the long run this action will have an impact on the holes.  Seriously how much would it cost to have a clasp in all the bracelets?  I was so excited to have the different colors and options but returned the item. Not worth the hassle and nails.  I hope they improve and or change them in the future and I will order them.

  I really like the bands and the Fit Bit Flex 2 tracker but changing out the metal clasp is difficult for me. Is there any way I can acquire 1 or 2 more metal clasps? I don't understand why each band doesn't come with the metal clasp. Your help is greatly appreciated.Susie

  Purchase the metal bracelet version of the this band for my wife. Very expensive but thought because it is sold by Fitbit it would be of a high quality. I was very wrong. Within 5 weeks one of the plastic retainers that connect the band to the Fitbit broke. Yes a PLASTIC retainer to hold a heavy metal band. Crazy glued it back into place and within a week the PLASTIC retainer on the OTHER side broke, only when this one broke we lost the piece so we were unable to try and glue it back together. We are outside of the amazon return window so it would appear I am stuck with a $100 paper weight. I am hoping a Fitbit representative will see this and do the right thing and replace the band. I've included pictures. The first shows the broken/missing plastic retainer. The second shows the repaired plastic retainer on the other side.

  I bought this bracelet for my wife's Fitbit. It's a very attractive piece of jewelry that ""dresses up"" her Fitbit Alta, and she loved it. In two months, the plastic latch piece that holds the bracelet onto the Fitbit broke. As has been pointed out, this is a heavy metal bracelet that costs $100. To make it's usefulness dependent on a fifteen cent piece of plastic is stunningly poor design.Fitbit replaced the bracelet the first time it broke. The second time, it was out of the one-year warranty. They knew that when I contacted them. I included my Amazon receipt and gave them the previous history. But, over several days, they required me to produce various documents and information that allowed them to link it to my wife's Fitbit account. Then, they had me take photos of the bracelet with a hand-written note with the case number included in the photos.After all that, THEN they told me that they couldn't do anything about it because it was out of warranty ... something they knew from the first contact email. They suggested I buy another one. I suggested what they could do with the broken one.

  My wife was reluctant to wear a fitbit, since they looked like one of those cheap rubber bracelets.  The goad band really dresses it up and as a result she now wears it all the time.  A quality product and a good choice for someone who wants a fitbit to look like jewelry.

  I bought this band to replace the band that originally came with my Fitbit Alta. I have to admit I'm disappointed with the way that Fitbit designed these bands. I absolutely love my Alta and have had it for around 6 months. But a few weeks ago, the band was feeling a bit wobbly, I unclipped it from the Alta tracker (for the first time ever, actually, as I wasn't sure how to correctly take it apart), and I decided to clean off the band. The strap seems to be two pieces fused together (there is the long portion that actually wraps around your wrist, and a smaller portion fused with it that actually straps to the alta). Well, the strap was coming loose from the portion that connects to the tracker, and I thought these two parts of the strap must come apart to clean it (they do not!). When I separated the inner section of the strap, I realized that it could not be attached back to the strap. Honestly, I think the strap would have broken on it's own in another month or two, as it had been wobbly for awhile, but regardless, it seems like the wristband itself is not very well made.All that aside, I love this plum color for a wristband. My original band still looked pretty great despite being worn practically 24/7 for several months. I highly recommend choosing the purple, as it is a dark enough color not to show wear or tear too much and it looks really classy.

  This is the second bracelet this style that I've purchased, the first in gold tone. Sad to say, both of them have broken at the Alta-bracelet junction. There is a clear piece of plastic on the inside that seems to be very fragile, and once it breaks, you can no longer attach the Alta to the bracelet. Such a disappointment, because I love how stylish this bracelet it. I've gotten so many compliments. I won't be spending another $100 on this bracelet.

  I‚Äôve had Fitbit trackers for years and I measure at the top end of the size SMALL plastic bands (6.5‚Äù-ish normally and 7‚Äù on a bad bloated day) I can button it tight when needed but still have several holes left to loosen it up if I want too. I bought the SILVER METAL bangle style bracelet (it only comes in a one size SMALL) and I figured it be ok. It fits ok but it‚Äôs snug. It won‚Äôt slide up and down my wrist like I‚Äôve seen some ladies say it does. I currently use a the Alta HR so snug is better for that HR aspect HOWEVER I had wanted a looser ‚Äúbangle‚Äù style for going out & dressing up the tracker. I‚Äôll keep this because it‚Äôs a nice piece, it does fit and I‚Äôll be able to use it. But I‚Äôm gonna have a custom one made that will be loser & give the ‚Äúbangle‚Äù effect better.

  I'd love to give this 5 stars as I really love my fitbit, however the color isn't what I expected. It's a very beigy-pink rather than the light pink color shown. When I opened it I thought it was the wrong item as the band looked like molded rubber, rather than leather, although once I touched it I could see that it was leather, although I still don't feel it looks quite like a leather band. It also gets ""dings"" fairly easily. I have one ding in the band - from what I have no idea - it's not like I've been playing contact sports. It surprised me. Overall I wish I'd purchased the protection plan as I'm not certain this is going to hold up the way I would hope. Having said all that, I do like the band and can recommend it, as long as the protection plan is purchased with it.

  As a banker I was looking for a way to dress up my Fitbit for my more formal work attire.  This was not the answer I had hoped for.  The leather is very low grade.  It looks like tan plastic not like a camel colored watch strap.  If you want a light brown Fitbit strap buy a plastic or rubber option for $10, send me $5 for the good advice, and put the $35 you saved in your savings account.

  Dongle came in the mail quickly.  It synched my Fitbit Charge HR and my laptop like it was supposed to.  It does stick out from the side of the computer a little- about half an inch- so you have to be careful not to knock it.

  First, let me say I can no longer use my Fitbit Ionic. It is dead in the water and I am still trying to figure out how to get it back up and running. It will no longer show any signs of life, no matter how long I leave it plugged in or how many times I reset it.Second, while it was operational, I really enjoyed the watch. It gave me accurate information and kept me updated with notifications from my phone. I had a couple hiccups with updates and such, but those were able to be remedied with a little work and effort.Third, I love the APP! I have another fitbit device I use because I wanted to continue to utilize the Fitbit App. It is one of the best layouts I've seen and it is perfect for my needs.Finally, if I had the option to buy again, knowing what I know now, I would look at other options. I've had several fitness devices and watches over the years and they all have problems....none are perfect. My best advice is pick one you like and can live with, and stick with it.

  I ordered the fit bit about a year ago and it came with one of these clip thingies.  The plastic on the back separates from the little nub and then it is constantly falling apart.  Why can't fitbit make a better product?  They should test these things more to see that after 6-8 months of taking it on and off of clothes, it falls apart.  Once that comes off, it never stays on again.  I still like my fitbit zip so here I am, buying this stupid product again.  Photo added.

  The clip works great, until it breaks.  It doesn't last as long as it should because of the way it is designed.  Once the tip breaks off from the back clip, it is time to get a new one.  Wish it had a better design that would last longer because they are a little pricey for what they are.

  I love my Zip, but agree with other reviewers.  My case has broken twice in 8 months.  The little nub falls off.  I can't really wear it once the nub comes off as it tears my clothes.  I love product as didn't want a wrist tracker, but am getting frustrated with the cases.  It also says the battery should last 6 months.  I'm lucky to get 3 months out of it.  Those are cheap to replace though.  I think Fitbit really needs to design a new case or offer a 3 pack with the original.

  I've only been using this a couple weeks, and already the plastic tip on the clip has fallen off and gotten lost, leaving the exposed sharp metal end of the clip exposed, making it much harder to clip to things without ripping fabric etc.  It doesn't seem like it should be rocket science to make a better clip than this for the zip--I think I have bought about 5 of them now, and they all have the same issue.  I love the Fitbit Zip but am so frustrated with dealing with these holders.

  I am glad that this clip exists so that I can purchase it, so I feel that I am being generous in giving it a three stars. What infuriates me is that I have to purchase it at all! This design flaw of the original clip is incomprehensible. There does not need to be a separated join (does that make sense?) between the bottom of the clip and the rest of it just so that the bottom can say ""fitbit."" It reminds me of the toner printer situation. Yep. The printer's cheap, but the toner's expensive and you have to keep buying toner. Please, don't make me have to keep buying fitbit zip clips. It's kind of ludicrous and makes me think that my money might be better spent elsewhere.

  I bought a Fitbit Zip back in 2014. Every year-ish I've had to buy a new clip because the old one wears out. This was the case a few months ago and I bought this replacement. It was absolutley horrible!! The silicone material on the back side of the clip would slide up and bunch up whenever I would try to put in on my waistband from the very first time I used it. Then the piece at the end covering the metal prongs fell off after less than a month, making it a huge pain to even use. Without the cover the prongs tear into the fabric on my clothes.  Not sure what happened with this one, but it is complete garbage and not up to the typical fitbit quality.

  As mentioned by someone else the band ships from Hong Kong so it takes time to arrive.  There is also no tracking information provided before the package arrives.I started using the wristband right away with no problems although the fit was tight. The original large FlexFit band was longer so I was surprised that I was using the holes on the end of the band.  After I charged the FitBit Flex the first time I reinserted the FitBit unit into the band and the band broke.  The original FitBit Flex band lasted over a year and I have now gone through three of the cheap replacement bands in as many months.The quality and length are not very good on this band.  I definitely would not recommend this wristband.

  But we've all noticed these bands just don't last long enough, right? And are WAY overpriced. But if you use an off brand (other than fitbit) your tracker will stop working, I think from water damage. So spend the money.

  Mine just came apart today where the clear plastic window part connects to the rubber.  I didn't realize until after I had received it that it wasn't a Fitbit brand replacement and it doesn't appear to be as strong as the original.

  I received the Slate and the Navy wrist bands today, They appear to be on a par with my Fitbit band. They may be a bit more flexible than the Fitbits. The connectors are included with the bands,  Shipping (direct from China) was quick, about 2 weeks. In the future, if  wish other colors, I will definitely order from this Amazon vendor. I will update my comments, if the bands disappoint.

  This is a poorly designed wrist strap using substandard materials.  I bought my Fitbit Flex in August. By mid-November, the metal clasp came loose and was lost. Fortunately the band itself was still in my sleeve. By mid-December, the band's soft rubber was separating from the hard plastic, risking the loss of the tracker itself.

  You definitely get what you pay for.  This was very inexpensive, so I can't be too upset, but the color that is shown is not the color I received.  Furthermore, the band that I received looks like a cheaper replica of a real fit-bit flex wristband, which also looks nothing like the picture shown.  Lesson learned...
"

  Fit is perfect.  Quality is good.  The only downside is that the coloring on the clasp was a cheap paint that chipped off quickly.  I fixed that by just making it all disappear at once.  My clasp is now silver instead of the original darker color, but it still looks fine with this color band.  No big deal to me.

  This replacement band works with the Fitbit flex but it in not as soft to the touch or as flexible as the original.  Based on the quality of the material and the price it is ok.  I am guessing this will last about half as long as the original.

  I'm writing this review 5 months after receiving the authentic Fitbit Flex band.  I have been through 3 original Fitbit Flex bands.  After the first 2 original bands that came with the Fitbit broke, I ordered a pack of knock off bands.  Some of those lasted a week, others lasted as long as the original bands, I decided to try another original Fitbit band again, hoping I'd have better luck.  Five months later, this one has split near the opening where the Fitbit goes into the band.  Let me say, I do not abuse these bands.  I take my Fibbit out while I take a shower and gently wipe them both off afterwards and let them dry.  The reason I do this is because the opening where the Fitbit goes can smell due to moisture getting into the opening.  I discovered that shortly after receiving the Fitbit and didn't want to take a chance of it smelling again. I charge the Fitbit about once a week.  When removing the device and putting it back into the band, I'm extremely gentle since I know how they split.  Five months is not very long to be wearing these bands and having them continuously break.  I love my Fitbit Flex but am considering buying a different device with the hope the band lasts longer.  I have already paid as much for bands as I did for the original Fitbit Flex!

  Although this is advertised as a fitbit replacement, not an imitation I expected it to fit as well as the one it came with.  As other readers commented it is smaller and the fact that it does not fasten very easier is very annoying.  In fact I have now lost my fitbit because it must have fallen off when I was wearing it, even though I was very careful to make sure it was securely fastened when I put it on.  I purchased this from Amazon because I though it was a ""real"" fitbit product and I got free shipping, while the official fitbit website charges around $10 for shipping.

  This isn't made as well as the wristband that came with my tracker but it is good enough. I've had it about 3 months and it is holding up as expected. I've used a FitBit for years and would have tried to exchange or return this one but I was replacing a broken wristband and didn't want to wait for a replacement.The window piece was misaligned during assembly which resulted in rough corners that are annoying and unpleasant. I would rather wait and see if the rough edges on this wristband wear down smooth. I'll probably try sanding it down so it feels nicer.

  I have used the UP by Jawbone as well as the Up 24 by Jawbone.  After 2 years of problems with the Up I switched to FitBit.  FitBit Flex is much lighter on the wrist.  You do not even realize that you are wearing it.  The Bluetooth connectivity is amazing and I have had no problems.  Other users who have had problems with Fitbit that I know have reported excellent customer service from Fitbit.  I loved this so much that I purchased one for my mother who is training for an upcoming race.

  I would give this band zero stars if I could, as it is obviously defective. I received this fitbit flex band on August 23, 2017. In less than a month and a half, the band tore almost completely in half near where you insert the fitbit. I have had my fitbit for over three years, had to replace the band twice before, both bands lasted for over a year, but this band is terrible! I sent a message to the seller informing them of this defective band and requesting a replacement but have not heard back. I strongly caution anyone who wants to purchase this band.

  I like the black band. I originally bought the orange band (since it was the only one that the fitbit website had in stock when I was purchasing my fitbit) and I felt like within a few hours it looked dirty. It seemed to accumulated marks and grubbiness and show every little thing, and I work in an office - I wasn't doing anything that would get it dirty. The black band is great - looks clean, simple, and professional. It fit my wrist and I've had no problem with the closure mechanism or anything. (That being said, I have recently misplaced my fitbit and I'm worried it fell off. if that's the case, though, that would have been the ONLY time the band has come unclasped on its own. It's been quite reliably secure.)

  FitBit claims this band for the Charge 2 is leather! $70 for what looks and feels to be some sort of rubberized, or soft plastic coated material. Not a hint of leather to be found on it, including the complete lack of that leather smell. I feel totally ripped off! This fake leather band was almost half the cost of the Charge 2 itself! Don't waste your money on it.Edited to add: This band also carries the Proposition 65 warning in California, where I live. It means this product contains chemicals known to be carcinogens. Now, tell me how this is made of leather???
"
0,SPORTS,Fitbit,"Fitbit Charge 2 Accessory Band, Blue, Large",$14.95,5.0,"
  Overall, I'm very happy with this replacement band. I dislike the sporty, athletic, look of the rubber wristband that comes with the Fitbit Charge 2, especially when dressing for work, so I was looking for an alternative. This is a great choice if you want your Fitbit to look less like a piece of sports equipment and more like a stylish watch.The band is nothing fancy. Rather than one thick piece of leather, the construction of the band is almost like a thin leather veneer wrapped around some kind of core material for structure. (I think the core might be made from leather as well, because the band flexes like leather more than like rubber, but I'm not cutting mine open to find out for sure.) You can see the layers in the detail shots of the band. If you're looking for something that resembles a high-dollar leather watchband, you'd be better served looking at the designer lines that have done collaborations with Fitbit, but for $60 (or less from third party sellers) this is a good value.The construction quality of the band seems durable, and is very comfortable. I've been wearing mine every day, and sleeping in it (taking it off only to shower, or to switch back to a rubber band for higher intensity exercise) for about a month. It's a genuine Fitbit accessory, so it attaches securely, snugly, and easily to the device, as you would expect. I like that the edge of the band lies perfectly flush with the watch face for a seamless look.All in all, a good band to change the look of your Fitbit. It looks nice and feels like it will last.

  I needed a replacement for my band, I had bought several cheap knockoffs but they really weren't cutting it. This band is a little stiffer then my original black band but it is great quality and worth the money. I thought switching from black to blue would be weird since I have had a black band for over 4 years but the blue is a nice dark color and doesn't stand out as much as I thought it would. I recommend not wasting money with the cheap bands if you are on the fence, spend the extra few dollars and go with the genuine fitbit brand because there is a huge difference.

  Buying a genuine Fitbit replacement band was totally worth the slightly higher cost compared to cheaper ‚Äúknock-off‚Äù bands. It took me months to find a genuine Small replacement band since Fitbit no longer sold Charge 2 accessories when (one side of) my original black band broke. The tracker still worked, so I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on an whole new device when I only needed a replacement band.I tried the cheap, fake bands; those bands didn‚Äôt fit well at all. Plus, the bands had extremely difficult clasps that made sliding the band off from the main Fitbit component nearly impossible once attached.If you have a very thin wrist, like me, even the genuine small Fitbit band isn‚Äôt a perfect fit.Nevertheless, this real Fitbit band is much, much better fit than the stiffer, rougher plastic used in the cheaper unofficial bands. The material is much smoother and bends (curves) more closely to the FitBit tracker when attached. The bands also slide on and off easily, as I expected, if I press the clasps.It was a relief to get this replacement band!

  This is a knockoff, plain and simple. The brand is listed as FitBit, but *check the sold and fulfilled by sections!*I purchased this in April 2018 and it broke in Oct 2018, so it lasted 6 months.

  After just a few months the band would not stay attached to my Fitbit and popped off easily so that I dropped my Fitbit a number of times, including not realizing it fell onto my driveway when I got home.

But I wouldn't recommend it, as others said it looks and feels more like plastic than genuine leather.

  It's fine - it fits and it's secure.  The only reason I deducted 2 stars is because it's not the ""slate blue"" that I expected or that I've seen on Fitbits in the stores.  It's more blue.

  This is a Fitbit product, why I spent a few ex dollars.  I absolutely love my fitness tracker for all that it does. I didn‚Äôt want to compromise the product with a knockoff charger. Actually ran to Target but they didn‚Äôt have mine ($19.99) so I just ordered it..works perfect just like the one that came with my Versa.

  I bought this to replace the granite special edition band that came with my Charge 4. The original band didn't dry out very quickly and was irritating to my wrist and smelled kind of bad. I like that this band has little holes in it so that sweat and water have someplace to go instead of getting absorbed into the band. It is lighter weight and more comfortable to wear than the special edition band. And it's beautiful! I'll still wear the special edition band when I need to get dressed up, but this white sport band will be my go-to most of the time!

  I absolutely love this original band as the perforation makes it more comfortable to wear it day and night - the skin breathes and the band is washed well inside out along the daily routine. It is also a bit lighter and the design of the band with bright white color makes the bracelet a lot more visible and noticeable.

  It works just how it is supposed to. The reason for 3 stars is because I wish the cord was longer. The fit bit connects by magnet to charger, due to the cord being short it just suspends in the air. Many times it has been knocked off by just a slight bump.

  Don't be fooled by the picture: this is the same charging cable that comes with the Fitbit Alta. It plugs into USB, and the other side has the jaw clip that holds the Alta to charge it. The picture simply shows the clip it from the top, so you see the tabbed part of the clip where you put your finger to open and close it. If they turned that tabbed part on its side you'd see it's the same cable they ship with the Alta; same size, same functionality. Great to have a backup, or a second for travel.

  I'm on my second charging cable in a year and a week. I love the Alta fitbit but their chargers fall apart at the drop of a hat, maybe even a feather. I got one with the Alta initially and I had in a drawer with other chargers. The clamps on it broke off and so I figured it must not have been able to stand up to the same kind of moment the other chargers in the drawer were able to. I limped along with tape for a few months and then it fell apart completely so I ordered a new one from Amazon. I got it in and kept it on a counter in its own bowl, for its own safety. Occasionally the possibility arose that something would touch the charger, like paper (other than me) but NOTHING banged into it, fell on it, smashed it or otherwise. I bought it 7 weeks ago.  I went to charge my Alta this morning and as I picked up the charger, it fell apart in my hands. :(  The clamps fell off in pieces!!! I called customer support and I'm so glad they are sending me another charger. I sure hope this one lasts a little longer!!!

  Product works great. The ALTA (not HR) charger is a little short but charges well. It does not fry my Alta like other people say. The solution is to plug it in a low- voltage port such as your laptop/pc port. Comes with reset button and is genuine.

  I really like that the charger clips on to the Alta, not that I have ever seen a charger for the Alta that doesn't, I just think that it is a good design.  I worry about buying off brand chargers after my iPhone battery was damaged by using one, so I splurged and bought the official Fitbit brand charger rather than something cheaper. Its the same as the one that came included with the Alta initially and seems solid enough to last for a while.

I will pay more if I know it will be worth it and what‚Äôs really the difference between $10.00 and $15.00? It‚Äôs from Fitbit so it‚Äôs the one that came with it.

  The 2nd time I hooked it up to my fitbit one of the sides broke.  They need to make these out of some type of metal.  I didn't go with the cheaper ones because the ratings were so low.

0,SPORTS,Fitbit,Fitbit Inspire Accessory Clip,$19.95,5.0,"
  This particular clip is the authentic Fitbit-brand that snugly fits around the Inspire, NOT the Inspire HR. I prefer the bright pink version, being easier to spot than black. I could save some money buying a two-pack or three-pack knock off that fits too loosely, but I want Fitbit, the company, to know there's a demand for these clips. I don't want a pedometer on my wrist! After the Fitbit One went extinct, the Fitbit Inspire became its clip-on replacement. I wish Fitbit would get the message and make more of their devices available on clips instead of insisting that they must be worn on wrists.

  My One tracker finally gave up on me and they‚Äôre no longer available. I decided to give the Inspire a try since it can be worn with this clip.  I don‚Äôt like the inaccuracy of the wrist-worn trackers (my sister sat and knitted all day and got in 10,000 steps!).Great device for holding the Inspire with the cover going completely over the button in the side.

  I specifically paid more to order fitbit brand wristbands, because I'd tried a couple ""cheaper"" versions that snapped in half quite quickly. I've had my fitbit since May of 2014 with the same wristband that finally cracked. I wore the teal/aqua one for no less than two days before it fell off and was lost. Thankfully a very honest soul returned it to the lost & found and I was able to get it back- the clasps ARE PLASTIC on the teal & orange bands in the box. So my clasp had broken due to my activity. When they snap together they seem very tight so I thought nothing of it. They do include a metal clasp in the box, but it amazes me that they are so ridiculously cheap that they'd put plastic on two of them and hope that you figure it out to switch the clasps. I mean, really, it probably costs them one penny to make these out of metal in their China factories. Or maybe they could keep the bands together to look pretty in the box with a piece of string or something that doesnt look exactly like a clasp. I almost lost $100 (or I guess maybe they look at it as though they'd gain another $100 when I repurchased another fiibit) because they want to save a penny.

  I have had my Fitbit for about a year and a half now, and it's great. I had a slate band, and it figured it was time to mix it up a bit. I love the pink and the violet, and I didn't really want to pay $15 for it when I could get three for $10 each, so I bought the Vibrant Accessory Pack.The bands seemed a little bit tighter than my original Slate band, but that may have to do more with the newness of it all. It came with only one clasp. My only concern was that when I opened the package, my pink wristband was covered in black at one of the ends. This was a bit of a disappointment, but most of it washed off. I did send a note to the Fitbit people about the QA issue. It looked like it could be ink from the box it came in.One of the things I like about Fitbit is the great customer support. I have gone through a few bands, and they always have sent me a new wristband so I can continue using my device. I can see why people would complain about not having a clasp with each bracelet. I have a few extra clasps I plan to use with mine, and even so, I still will have to interchange some of them. This may not be the best if you are in a hurry or you struggle with it. Plus, I think the band would loosen up enough that you would risk losing your Fitbit. I will be curious to see how they are after a few months, but based on my past experience, I feel like the company will back up their product if it fails for some reason.

  7/28/14 UPDATE:  can't explain this but updating my review and upgrading to 5 stars because the Navy band I was convinced was Black is now clearly Navy Blue.  It is lightening in color just enough that I can easily distinguish from Black.  There has been no color run off of any kind...and I don't wear my bands in the shower.  While this still isn't as bright blue as pictured it is now a nice Navy and has become the color I wear most often now.  Love it.  Never falls off.  Warrants 5 stars now.These bands are original Fitbit - I was concerned about receiving an 'after market' knock-off/compatible band.  The colors are bit off - I selected this combination because the Navy blue appears to be a rich/deep blue on my PCs (a Dell and HP) and my iPad.  When the package arrived, I was convinced I was sent the wrong item - the Navy is almost indistinguishable from Black.  I had to hold it next to something black and something navy to be sure.  If you want a blue band, I would look elsewhere as this is Navy black.On the upside the Orange is a slightly muted version of what is displayed on screen and I actually love it.  That was a nice suprise because I was questioning if would ever wear a neon orange band.  It's not neon orange and will be great with summer clothing.The set comes with only one clasp - not one for each band.  The other two bands are held in place for packaging with clear plastic tabs.  I would not try to use these plastic tabs to secure the band for normal wear.  Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase... I needed a few additional colors to coordinate better with my clothing given my arms are now exposed in warmer weather.  This does the trick ...at a fair price.

  I just got a FitBit Flex two weeks ago and the self-awareness it creates has already changed my life. Big fan over here. I did start to see a softness in the band where the Bit goes in after two weeks of continuous use but that's hardly a surprise as I wear it all day and night, running, sweating and banging around, living life. You have to remember it's just a piece of plastic. Don't wear it tightly. (Can't get it on without help? Too tight!)  I do a quick swipe with some antiseptic to clean it bc it needs to stay dry to stay clean.  Lastly, don't take the Bit out unless you MUST charge it.  The charge is supposed to last 5 days.I bought these to switch it up.  I was pleased to see that these alternatively colored bands also change the lights!

  Hate this cable- why can't they just make it a normal connector? I don't know, I guess they want more money when I lose the original. Well it's working, because I lost the original on vacation and I had to reorder this one from Amazon. The 3 stars are because the product i received is the same I got in the original box, and because Amazon is great and I had the cord in 2 days with prime - but I'm still not excited about needing a completely dedicated power cord for just this. Also, why couldn't it be the same as the original charge HR? I had 3 of those cords- would have been nice to have another to use in my office, car, etc. Fitbit, if you're reading this, time to standardize your charging cords because it's useless clutter to have dedicated charging cords for everything. Consider that when converting over to Type C. Also, now that I have your attention, how about making the next charge HR waterproof? I'm tired of taking it off when I'm swimming in the ocean or giving my children a bath üëçüèª

  If they called this color ""putty"" they'd be right on. Even beige. It's by no reasonable estimation graphite or grey. Not even close. I'm a pretty loyal Fitbit devotee, but this missed the mark entirely. It wasn't even in the neighborhood.

  After a few months of everyday wear the band did not stand up to the test of time like the description states. The leather stretched so the button clasps began to fit loosely on the strap; my Fitbit would frequently fall off. I nearly lost it twice but luckily both times someone found it and turned it in. The leather also became easily scuffed and looked rather shabby. I'm hoping to receive a credit or replacement since it's still under warrenty.

  Perfect! Fitbit brand, so as you would expect, it fits exactly as it should. The way it hooks on to your Fitbit doesn't add any width to the way it fits on your wrist (several off brands do).

  The band was great until until it cracked on one of the attachment points to the tracker and will no longer click in and hold.

  I was looking for a good band for my Versa 2 and after reading crappy reviews from some of the off-brand bands I decided to try the brand name one. I'm not disappointed. Its soft, comfortable, and keeps my wrist from being too sweaty which has caused irritation before. Most people believe its the band that causes the rash but it's a lack of cleaning the band/wrist area that causes the contact dermatitis. Take your watch off every now and then and keep it clean and you'll be fine. The clasp is made from a nice hard plastic it seems which I like as I don't trust cheap metal clasps.

Much better than the (skinny little) silicone band that came with the watch and FAR better than a ""lookalike"" $7.99 no-name brand of this same sport strap (believe me, I bought this and the $7.99 knockoff perforated sport strap at the same time, but it was no contest).  This band is absolutely superior, and worth the money to me.

  My only complaint is the nub that holds the watch bands together is not big enough to keep the overlapping band secured.  The outer band will not stay inside the sleeve that has the nub while sleeping or doing any other high impact activities.  I have the band tight to my wrist, but it still comes loose constantly.  Looking for another band that may have a better securing device.

  This might be nitpicking, but while this band looks and feels great, the band to hold the extra does not stay in place or hold the extra band where it's supposed to. Several times a day I have to reinsert the end of the band because it has popped out and gotten in the way.

  Item was indeed a FitBit brand band, as described. This band is just as great as the one that came with my versa originally, which eventually broke after 2 or 3 years of use.Always, always, always spend the extra cash to buy FitBit bands!! Those cheap off-brand bands break so easily, discolor quickly, and irritate the skin. I've had many different FitBits over the years and purchased many off-brand bands for them. I'm telling you, just buy the FitBit bands!

I can not wear it at all because I get really irritated skin if I wear it to long I sometime I get an rash and it really hard for me to wear any band on it cuz it hurts. I don‚Äôt recommend this if you have very sensitive skin. I recommend going with silicone band if you have sensitive skin.

0,SPORTS,Fitbit,Fitbit Ionic Accessory Sport Band,$28.95,5.0,"
  This new band replaces the stock Ionic band that I broke. (Actually, the little piece that holds the end down fell out rendering the band useless) Just push the grey buttons to remove, and click the new one into place - easy peasy. Far easier than the tiny spring-loaded pin bars on old watches. This one is lighter than the original - and because it is a bit thinner, it is also more comfortable. The holes are spaced closer together so it adjusts in smaller increments to your wrist. This is really nice because the other one was either a bit too tight, or a bit too loose for me. The piece that holds the end of the band down will not come off like the little insertion post that came off the old one. I was not happy about the ridiculously high price of this (and it IS a ridiculous price given that it is just a little hunk of molded plastic) but then again...it works perfectly and makes wearing the watch a more tolerable experience.
"
0,SPORTS,Fitbit,Fitbit Ionic Accessory Sport Band,$28.95,5.0,"
  The band that came with my Ionic was bulky and I didn't like the color, so I ordered this sport band. I almost bought one of the many cheap, off-brand alternatives, but I'm so glad I didn't. It is very well made, light, and way more comfortable than the stock one. I hated paying 30 bucks, but I'm glad I did. Also looks great. It was super easy to replace. Very happy.

  This watch band did the trick for a while... I thought this was the fix for the fitbit Ionic errors in heart rate detection and also the times of non-detection and it did that for a few days and then the watch went back to having errors in reading heart rate by as much as at least 75bpm to not reading at all where it just displays two dashes -- or back to errors again. The fit of this is very nice, it allows the watch to be flat against your wrist without tightening it as much as the standard bands. And I really like the look of it, sweating less in it too. Personally I have heard a lot of people having trouble with other brands than fitbit tearing, but I can't say if this fitbit branded one is better or not because I have officially given up and retired the watch and am on to a new fitwatch. Wish me luck?
"
0,SPORTS,Fitbit,Fitbit Ionic Accessory Sport Band,$28.95,5.0,"
  Bought this to replace the standard band after it started coming apart at the edges. The sport band is actually quite a bit lighter and since it has more holes it's much easier to get a snug yet comfortable fit. Because it's more breathable it doesn't get slimy when I sweat and dries off way faster when it gets wet too.
"
0,SPORTS,Fitbit,Fitbit Ionic Accessory Sport Band,$28.95,4.0,"
  I very much like this sport band for my Fitbit. It's a lot more breathable than the one that comes standard with the Ionic. Best of all, it doesn't have that annoying hook-like clasp design the original has, though the guide does have two rubber prongs to secure the excess, unused part of the band once it's tightened. This can make it only slightly tricky when it comes to unfastening the band to adjust or remove, but nowhere near the frustration levels of that damn original ""it feels like a trap!"" clasp design. The hexagonal pattern on this band lends a somewhat sporty, futuristic feel to the design of the device itself. I really like the colors (black outside, grey inside) and although these hexagonals can and will collect dust/dead skin cells/lint, it washes and dries quickly.

  I bought so many ionic bands. usually the insertion/connection part of the band breaks easily. even the original one from fitbit broke after half a year. but this band is very durable. for your reference, I wear the watch almost all the time and during exercises (gym and swim) regularly. one thing to improve is I hope they offer a smaller size for female wrist.

0,SPORTS,Fitbit,Fitbit Ionic Accessory Sport Band,$28.95,5.0,"
  I really like this band. I had been wanting to get it but wasnt sure about the band because I didnt know if the little part on it would slide off, and I liked the little part that clasps into the band on the one it comes with. But it does come with little things to stick into the holes. Whatever these things are called so that made it completely perfect. With the band on it, it reminds me of the jurassic park watches that came out at Burger King when the lost world came out.

  I have a very small wrist so I have to tighten any watch band. Needless to say, the plastic band that came with my Fitbit 3 watch was uncomfortable and left marks on my wrist especially after sleeping with it. I could not wait to take it off in the morning. This band has enabled me to wear my Fitbit 3 watch 24/7 with no problems at all.  It is so light and comfortable  I forget I even have the watch on! No sweat underneath during or after work outs too! It is the real deal and worth it especially for those of us with small wrists.

  I had a dermatitis reaction to a 3rd party Charge 3 compatible sports band that caused itching and rash.

  I purchased this to use on a Fitbit Charge 3 that I was given. The original band was kind of small and plastic-like so I wanted something that was different and looked more like a watch, but was breathable. I looked at cheaper versions of this but went with the Fitbit brand because I trusted their quality and product. The cheaper models tended to break or be lose or the fabric was itchy. This one was very easy to change out and has caused me no problems. It is very lightweight, breathable, and comfortable. I love it!

  I have very small wrists. I ordered a small band and although disappointed by the excess length, I was not surprised. This happens to me a lot. I solved the problem by cutting the excess off.  Unfortunately I had to return the fitbit because it did not track my heart accurately due to it being too wide for my wrist and because I had cut the band returning it was not an option. As I was stuffing the cut band back into it's original box I noticed that there were two stickers, one labeling it as a small, and the other as a large. If I had noticed that when it first arrived I would have returned it before cutting the excess length off. That being said, the band material was soft and breathable.

  The original band on the Fitbit was giving me a very sensitive rash, almost to the point where although I loved it, I was going to stop wearing the tracker. Buying this band completely eliminated the rash, and overall has made the Fitbit more comfortable to wear. I recommend it, even with the high price tag. (35 dollars for a piece of canvas is highway robbery, but what can you do?).

Comfortable, breathable, and stylist.I wasn't paying attention when I bought and got large instead of small.

  Like the original band, this one clips on and stays on the device.  I do like the holes - as it does lend to the breathability of the band.  I also like that the strap band has little teeth to keep ahold of the end of the strap (like the original fitbit band).  I didnt realize that from the picture, so that was a nice added bonus.  It fits just that little bit better than the original band that I was looking for giving me just a little bit more comfort.

  The quality is not reflective of a $60 wristband at all. Gaps in the intersection where the leather meets the watch are massive, and the leather at these points has visible tooling marks. For a wristband that is supposed to be a luxury item, the production feels more like budget.Pros:- Great color- Very comfortableCons:- poorly manufactured (tooling marks, gaps)- Expensive- Price doesn't match quality

  I took 1 star off because I was hoping the band would be a bit thicker (sturdier).  The width and length is as expected.  But the band is a little thin for me.  I realize being thinner helps with flexibility and comfort, and that's why it's worth 4 stars.  (I'm spoiled a bit by the relative thickness of my brown leather band on my Garmin Fenix 5.)

  The product is great and as advertised. It is 100% original although keep in mind that leather will start forming seams and it is nowhere close to being suitable for exercise or even sweat. Even a little sweat can cause a permanent stain the the back of the band although it may not spoil the aesthetics when worn since the stain isn't seen. It remains to be seen if it holds up over time.

  We‚Äôve had this Fitbit Ace 3 since launch, and I‚Äôd like to point out a few of the upgrades when compared to the Fitbit Ace 2:- More rounded / Curved shape, seems like it would feel more comfortable to wear. The part to tuck in the strap is also better, strap doesn‚Äôt come out as often if your kid had that issue- Better screen - the animations and display look better- Longer battery life. It is now 8 days instead of 6, and the battery noticeably lasts much longer- New animated faces (a few), with apparently Minion licensed content and straps coming soon- No more one button on the left. Both left and right side have these two touch sensors which can be used for going back to the menu or activating the water lock- Waterproofing has been improved to a depth of 50m, but if your kid is going for a swim, they‚Äôll have to turn on the water lock (long press of both sensors, and then double tap screen when it asks you to)- Still connects seamlessly with the Fitbit app and kids view mode etc.- BIGGEST UPGRADE: Fitbit has since the last 2-3 years moved to bad charging connectors in my opinion, the old Alta 2 ones were the best. The Ace 2 and Inspire use magnetic chargers made of plastic but they don‚Äôt hold well. With the Ace 3, they‚Äôve added two clips that hold the charger in place. Not sure if other new fitbit chargers have this, but this is a big upgrade from the old Ace 2 charger which was not easy to hold in placeAll in all, neat upgrades to the best kids tracker out there, at the same price point as before!

  This is a great item for children. They are encouraged to complete the challenges and the screen displays grow with the steps so they can see rockets take off, plants grow, and other things as they increase their steps daily. I also like to see their sleep and how much they are getting. It shows you from when to when they sleep. I would love for them to add more detailed features so I can see how many times my child wakes up during the night. See their floors and other features that adult ones have. Switching between your app screen to the children's one sometimes takes a long time unless you do it daily.

  We have had it for around a week, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is very glitchy sometimes to go from one screen to another. It gets the adults very frustrated trying to get it back to the main screen where it shows the steps. Our 7 year old wear it to school both for him to tell time and to see how many steps he walks in a day...so far he has beat me every.single.day!Overall I think it is a descent device for this price ...just wish they could make it a little more kids friendly (to be frank, us adults can‚Äòt even get it to work half the time)...but it is light weight, water resistent (which I still dont understand how the water lock thing works) and is cute and not annoyingly huge. Would I recommend it to others? Probably not, but our family is used to fitbit and dont want to invest time to find a better device, this is nothing to write home about but meet our needs.

  It's stupid. The functionality is terrible. It doesn't even monitor heart rate. Just sleep and steps. I could have bought something a third of the price that does that. Plus it leaves a red rash on the arm if you wear it for too long. I hate it.

  I waited a bit to write this review. Absolutely the best way go. I tried a few cheaper versions and they were all crap. I should have stopped being such miser and gotren this one to start. My daughter loves it and keeps us on our toes with the step count!  I recommend.  She 8.

  Oh yes, this device will cause a special kind of madness in you and your loved ones. More on that later, some of the  basics first.The Fitbit Flex is very easy to set up. The app will walk you through syncing to your phone, setting up goals and connecting to friends. Once set up you can log steps counted (shocking for a pedometer, right), calorie burn from other exercise, food intake, water intake and sleep. It is comfortable to wear, the battery life is decent and frankly being able to work towards fitness targets is a great motivator so it keeps you accountable.Where does the madness lie, I hear you ask. Challenges.The in app challenges will turn normally quite sane friends and family members into step obsessed lunatics. They work by allowing you to invite your Fitbit friends to see who can get the most steps in a day, work week or weekend. During the challenge time you get updates on how you are doing verses the step totals of everyone else in the challenge. If your work buddy powers past you, you'll get a notification through the app. Should you are your sister in law be neck and neck you'll both get a message letting you know. If you are even a little bit competitive this can lead to mayhem.Let's just say my wife and I are two people who don't like losing, especially to each other. I have found Mrs B. walking in tight circles in the kitchen while cooking, just to up that step count a little higher. I have been known to slip out of the house to get a quick walk around the block in, in an effort to make sure that she doesn't catch me. We've had reports of other family members watching TV while walking in place just to make sure they don't fall behind on a challenge.Don't get me wrong, the challenges are a lot of fun and really help you get more steps in which is great for your physical health. It's just neighbors who have seen me aimlessly walking around our back yard while muttering about step counts have started avoiding me in the street.

  1. I LOVE the fitbit.2. I like the interface.3. It's helped me lose weight and keeps me motivated.Why 3 stars?4. I bought it in August of 2016 and now, less than a year later, it's stopped working. I take very good care of it. It's never gotten wet or dropped. I don't overcharge it. For $7.50 a month it's a good deal given I've easily underspent my normal food buying because I use the fitbit, BUT I would have expected it to last more than 10 months.Will I buy another? Yes because it helps me keep track of what I do each day.But I think they should last longer than 10 months.

  Update 12/8/15 - Fitbit just added a new firmware update for the sleep timer feature. Once updated it's no longer necessary to tap the Fitbit before going to sleep or when waking it. It will now recognize when you're inactive and have gone to sleep. It also has some new goal setting software in the app relating to sleep to make it easier to focus on getting more (or less) sleep. The graphic interface is pretty nice. I'm looking forward to using this since I've become something of a night owl and could really stand to get on a better schedule. One more thing to like about my Fitbit.The update took about 5 minutes using my iPad and plugging my Fitbit into its charger while it updated. The whole thing was simple. A red arrow on the dashboard, in the sync area alerted me to the upgrade. I really like this new feature.I  bought 3 of these fitbit flex devices, one for myself, my husband and my sister. Before purchasing I researched several wristband devices such as the Jawbone UP, the Nike Fuel and and the Polar Loop. I also looked at the fitbit force which is a newer version of this band. The lack of water resistance on the force was a deal breaker for me. I wanted to be able to wear this band 24/7 and to be able to wear it in the shower or when swimming. That was part of what made it attractive to me. Also, after reading reviews about the clasp problems on the force and how many people lost them, I wanted no part of that. They are also quite a bit bigger and look clunckier.  The wristband on the UP looked like it would catch on everything and had no display at all. The Polar had lots of quality problems. I wasn't crazy about the looks of the Nike. The display is nice and I can see how people would like them, but not my style. The fitbit flex, to my tastes, had the coolest look. I also know a couple of people who own the fitbit flex and they were very enthusiastic about them so that influenced me as well.So here is what I like about the flex: I like the way it looks on my wrist. All of us got the slate color. You can also order bands in a few different colors, both here and on the Fitbit site.  It is lightweight and even though I don't often wear a watch I don't notice this on my wrist at all. The clasp was VERY difficult to secure the first couple of times until the rubber softened up a bit and until I got the hang of it. I secured it off of my wrist a couple times when it was new. Making sure the band and clasps are lined up correctly and then placing one finger directly below the clasp and my thumb directly above and squeezing hard was the way to do it.I like that it's water resistant and that I can wear it swimming or in the shower. It is safe down to 10 meters or around 30 feet. I like that the wristband is made of TPU rubber, which according to Wikipedia is a type of rubber used in automotive instrument panels, caster wheels, power tools, sporting goods, medical devices, drive belts, footwear, inflatable rafts, and a variety of extruded film, sheet and profile applications. I think it should hold up for a very long time. I like that the display on the band gives me a rough idea by tapping on it of my progress throughout the day. I can also check my progress on my iPhone 4S and see number of steps so far, calories burned, how many hours of sleep I got last night and how often I woke up or was restless. So far it seems very accurate. I can also track the foods I've eaten and the calories, my weight goals and weight lost, check on the weekly number of steps friend's with Fitbits have taken and compare them with my own.I like that I can wear it 24/7 and only have to take it off to charge it once every 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to charge with a USB thingie that comes with it. I use a wall adapter to charge it but could also use a USB port on my desktop or laptop computer. I've lost too many pedometers in the past by dropping them out of my pockets or forgetting about them and sending them through the washing machine, so the wristband seems like a much better option for me. I also like that I can connect wirelessly with my smartphone and with the little dongle included that goes into my desktop or laptop, can connect with those wirelessly as well. Software downloads for all of these are free. I'm also able to connect on my first gen Kindle HD 8.9 although I can't see where it's shown as a supported device so far. But it works with the Android fitbit software in the app store.The step measurements seem reasonably accurate. Waving my hand slowly won't register as a step. Waving wildly will. Driving in the car won't register but reaching around quickly in the car sometimes will. Typing on the computer or Kindle won't register. I've heard that swimming doesn't register either but you can input the time and activity on your phone or tablet.  When I first got the flex I started the iPhone app and watched my steps register on my screen as I walked around the house. That, and watching my steps on the treadmill have shown it to be pretty accurate for me, although not perfect. I think that all pedometers have some inaccuracies. What I'm looking for is a comparative trend where I can tell how much exercise I'm getting. The accuracy is good enough for me.So I wake up in the morning, tap the wristband quickly a few times to tell it I'm awake. Then if I tap it twice I see one tiny blinking light, telling me I'm working on my first 2,000 steps. Later, when I've hit that mark and tap to check again, I'll see one solid light and the second one blinking. There are 5 lights total and each represents 2,000 steps (or 20% of my goal. I could set it up differently on my computer, using a different number of steps as my daily goal if I wanted to.) So I can see my approximate progress any time during the day.  When I hit my goal of 10,000 steps the band vibrates and all the lights flash. That means you done good!I can set up to 8 silent vibrating alarms on this fltbit. I have one to wake me up on weekdays (you can specify which days) and one at 8:00 each night to remind me stop eating for the day. The vibration gets my attention and is effective at waking me up. I set the alarms on my computer or phone.At night when I'm in bed and ready to go to sleep I tap the wristband rapidly a few times, it vibrates briefly, and goes into the sleep mode until I wake it again in the morning.So am I happy that I purchased the Fitbits for myself and my family members? Yes I am. It motivates me to walk or run more. I can connect to other friends and family with Fitbits to see everyone's weekly step progress but what really motivates me is just competing against myself. I'll find myself parking in the back of the parking lots at stores to log those extra steps or walking around the store longer because it's a good way to add even more. When I haven't reached my goal at night, I'll sometimes walk around the house several times just to hit a number. Now that can't be all bad, can it?Update 1/12/14 - I'll keep updating this review with comments and observations as I use this device. I noticed that walking at a rapid pace is counted as ""active minutes"". Someone on a message board suggested adding a touch of lotion to the clasp if you're having trouble getting it to clasp when it's new.Update 1/16/14 - A full charge is lasting just a bit over 7 days. It takes about 3 hours to recharge it fully.Update 1/21/14 - Some people have complained about this band coming undone and losing it. I haven't had any problems with it at all, even when pulling tight coat and shirt sleeves over it, brushing my arm against things or the dog pulling on it once or twice. (I'm sure the dog could have pulled it off if I didn't stop him.) The other day I had the dog's leash wrapped around the wrist with the Fitbit and even with the dog pulling against the leash the fitbit stayed on. We walked this way a couple of miles before I noticed it and unwrapped the leash from my wrist. But even with all that agitation my fitbit stayed put. It has stayed on through enough that I'm not very concerned about losing it. I've only taken it off to charge it. I have the band snug enough that I can only put one finger beneath the band but I can move it a couple of inches back and forth on my wrist.Update 7/3/14 - A new update that works with iPhones that use the Fitbit app was released a few days ago. I've used it with my iPhone 4S and really like the new upgrade. It adds a whole new dimension to my Fitbit app. With the upgrade, I just click on the exercise icon on the dashboard which takes me to a new screen showing the days of the week that I've exercised. (Meaning a walk, run or hike, something in addition to the regular walking in my daily activities.) This screen shows exercise frequency by day of the week, it puts a check on the days that you do some planned exercise. If I click the little stopwatch in the upper right-hand corner, it takes me to a screen where I can click Walk, Run, or Hike. I go back and can then click Cues which takes me to another screen where I can select whether or not I want to hear spoken cues. I can also tell it which cues I want including: Distance, Time, Average Pace, Split Pace, and Calories Burned. Then I go back again an can select the frequency of the cues from every .5 miles to every 5 miles.  Or, I can make the cues time based ranging from every 2 minutes, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 minutes. I can also select the volume of the cues. (Medium was perfect for me.) Then, back again to select a playlist from my iPhone's loaded tunes. Last, I allowed location services for Fitbit in my phone settings and I was ready to go. Now I see a big red circle with a Start arrow on the screen over a GPS map showing my location. I pop in my earphones, click Start and my music starts playing.As I walk, I can see a screen showing how far I've walked, rate per mile, time elapsed. Every half mile a voice interrupts my music telling me how far I've gone and all the other things I've specified in Cues that I wanted to know. Then it goes back to playing my music until it's time for my next designated Cue. How cool is that? It works seamlessly. At the end of my walk I tell it I'm finished (or I could also pause it if I stop to talk to a neighbor or something). When I'm finished (or even during the walk or run) I can see a little red line  showing my route on the map. The steps from my walk are added to my steps count, just as they always are. I love these new features. They add a lot to the Fitbit experience.For those of you who track calories and foods eaten in the Fitbit app, the update now includes a bar code scanner. So far, the things I've scanned have been in their database. If you don't see the bar code symbol in the upper right-hand corner of the Log Food screen, log out of the Fitbit app and then log back in and it should be there.Update 11/28/14 - If something happened to ithis Fitbit today, what would I replace it with? Another one just like it. If one of the new Fitbit models was interchangeable with it on a daily basis I might get one of those too, just because I like new technology. But this one would be my main fitness band. I would like having a watch built in, but then it would look kind of silly wearing a conventional watch on the other arm. And I have a lot of nice watches.Update 12/12/14 - I just noticed today that the Fitbit Flex is the #1 Best Seller on Amazon this holiday season. It does seem like when I see people wearing fitness bracelets, this is the one they're most often wearing. A lot of the competitors have lowered prices significantly on their devices which is probably the best indicator of all. It's nice to know that I'm not the only Fitbit fan after wearing it for nearly a year. :)Update 12/26/14 - My Fitbit looks all new for the holidays. This replacement bracelet took over 20 days to arrive but for about $2 it was worth the wait.

  I bought a Fitbit Flex from Amazon about a year ago. I finally lost it. The clasp is lousy and easily catches on clothes, or anything else that brushes up against it. I purchased a second Fitbit Flex. I tried to install it on my iPhone-but Fitbit sign in will not recognize my pw. I called the Fitbit company and they were unable to reset it or send an email. Something is seriously wrong with this company. They escalated it to a ""higher department"", but they are so busy it will take 2 days. My bank, broker, etc sent a reset instantaneously-This company is not ready for prime time. I liked the Fitbit fine for recording my activity, etc., but the support is in the Dark Ages.I will purchase a buckle style wristband if I ever get this new Flex set up.

  I read a decent amount of the reviews before buying and was 50/50 on even getting the Inspire based on the negative reviews. But, I went for it anyways. I received the Inspire (regular one) on Sept 27.. 5 days later, still haven‚Äôt had to charge it. I guess I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones? BUT I did disable getting my text notifications since I usually always have my phone in my hand anyways. So could be why the battery doesn‚Äôt drain. People were complaining about the band leaving rashes and whatnot... my advice, don‚Äôt wear it so tight then. People complained about how it dims too fast.. look faster? It doesn‚Äôt take you more than a couple secs to look at your info and keep it moving. If you want to stare at your numbers I suggest you just open the app since it syncs it anyways. People complained about the charger being too short, it aint like you gonna be wearing the tracker while it‚Äôs charging so who cares. People complained about counting ghost steps, are a few ghost steps here and there gonna kill you? My point is, it‚Äôs a tracker, it works (at least for me), it‚Äôs sleek, it‚Äôs lightweight, i‚Äôm happy with it.

  I've owned the Fitbit Alta, Alta HR, and Blaze. My favorites have been the Alta and Alta HR. I love the size and convenience of charging once per week! I lost my Fitbit Alta and wanted to replace it. This Inspire came out and I loved the look of it! I ordered it and I got it delivered on March 20th. Started using it around 22nd. Well...I've had to charge this thing every 2 days. I said every 2 days!! Coming from charging my Fitbit every 5 to 7 days to charging every 2days is ridiculous! Also note: I don't have ""Always connected"" enabled. I have notifications enabled and only for calls/texts.  So my Fitbit died today after I charge it less than. 24 hours ago...that was the final straw. I'm sending this crap back and rebuying a Fitbit Alta. New isn't better in the case.

  Absolutely love the look, feel and usefulness of the Inspire .... nice having the choice of wearing it on my wrist or with a clip that can be purchased.

  Edited to add: I've now tried to sync this piece of junk about 50 times. I have the dongle from my Fitbit One: doesn't help. I put the Inspire right UP TO the dongle and it still won't sync. YES, I've done all of the troubleshooting suggestions. Seems from the other reviews that Fitbit released this KNOWING that it won't sync! I want my money back.I bought the Inspire the day it was released. Despite the fact that my old Fitbit One would always sync with my computer with no problem, this Inspire will NOT sync up. I've tried it over a dozen times, followed the troubleshooting instructions, etc. Honestly, I feel like I got ripped off. I loved my Fitbit One SO MUCH, but it was accidentally put through the washer and after that it wouldn't hold a charge -- I would have to charge it 2 or even 3 times a day, which was inconvenient. Bring back the Fitbit One please!!

  My fault for not reading carefully enough, but the $70.00 version does not monitor your heart rate.Now that I go back and read the advertisement on the product page it seems obvious, but I was in  too much of a hurry.  I got the impression that both versions monitor heart rate, but only the $100 version does.  Since that is the main reason I ordered the thing, I expect this fitbit will be sitting in a drawer and another $70.00 are out the window.What you get for your seventy bucks is a rather unattractive watch and a suite of apps that don't do anything an app on your iPhone won't do for you already.

  Have used Fitbit products for at least five years.  This one - the Inspire which I purchased with a clip to try to replace my failing Fitbit one (would no longer take a charge) is a dismal failure.  It works but unlike the Fitbit one which I charged once per week this one looses all capability after two or three days and then need charging.  Moreover it does not track stairs.  So IMHO an abject failure to replace the Fitbit one which is no longer available!I have replaced it with another product at one third the cost that does more, has a usable app and  can be charged once ever other week -- better than even the Fitbit one>  In short look around and do not buy any fFtbit product until you check out their competition -- now better overall and far less costly!

  Very disappointed with the Inspire. I simply wanted to track my steps, nothing more than that. The band was very difficult to close.  It required a great deal of pressure and even then it wouldn't always snap through the punch hole. It would record steps every time I moved my hand (and I did select dominant to deal with the sensitivity issue per online help) -  if I simply waved my hand back and forth It would add 10 or more steps. This is contrary to what online support says regarding the few extra steps that may be recorded. So there was always a question of how many steps I had taken in a day. I discovered also that it would not record my stationary bike activity. I ride it daily since my hip replacements for 10plus miles. If there was a way to manually add the activity, I could not locate it in the Inspire on line app. And after searching on line help, I discovered the limitations of this Fitbit model. For example, with more expensive Fitbits, spinning is a menu selection, which can be used to imitate stationary bike activity. Unfortunately this was not a menu selection for the Inspire I had.  At $80.00 it was too expensive given the difficulty I was having with it.  Spending more for a fancier Fitbit with a band that was easier to close didn't appeal to me. So I returned it.

  The is my fourth fitbit.  The wristband breaks under normal use.  This starts as bubbles in the band, then frayed glue, then disintegration.  The only remedy at 366 days+ is to beg for a repair which I did just once, for my most recent fitbit.  They sent me a refurb which I thought was great.  But the refurb lasted only three months before it failed.  All in all, I've purchased four and five failed.Why NOT put the wristband on a hinge and take the stress of the glue and make the band replaceable?  This century old design works great for watches.  It's almost like they design these Fitbit things to fail in a year...Five stars if they change their annuity model and make a durable product.

  I work out all the time, and I wear my Fitbit all the time, regularly participating in competitions with my friends.  The motivational part of the Fitbit gets it one star.  Here's where the stars start falling off.  While I love the motivational aspect of the Fitbit and love a little healthy competition with my friends, the stats are not very accurate.  Having had a polar heart monitor (strap included) before, I knew what my heart rate and calorie count should be, and the Fitbit is pretty far off-base (1 star down).  Also,I purchased this in 2015, and right around a year later, the area on the back where you charge it completely fell apart and looked completely corroded inside (aren't these supposed to be sweat resistant...especially since they are typically worn by people working out?) - two stars down. I might also add that I regularly made sure I took it off and let it dry completely before putting it back on.  I contacted Fitbit, as I had heard their customer service was great.  They reluctantly gave me a new one, but made sure to let me know that it would never happen again - three stars down.  There's no sense in being catty.  It wasn't like I didn't have a legitimate complaint.  It's my feeling that if you  know people are going to be wearing these almost 24/7 AND sweating in them, they need to be more durable.  Less than 6 months into my SECOND Fitbit, the back has again fallen apart (you can see the crack in the picture where the charger connects to the tracker) - four stars down.  I'm done.  I'm very careful with my Fitbit.  I was even more careful the second time around to make sure I pressed against the back as I was pulling the charger off, and it still fell apart in even less time.  I'm going back to my tried and true Polar.

  I love the fitbit line and really liked my Charge HR until about 6 months in when it started falling apart. First the band was just slightly giving away, now it's much worse and I can see right into the device. I do wear it daily/nightly, but I work in an office environment so it gets treated pretty well.For the price, I would have expected it to last much longer.

  UPDATE: After a little over a year, as has happened to the previous three FitBit products I've owned, this one started falling apart. I knew it was outside the one year warranty, so I glued the pieces back together, and it worked for a few months, but now it won't hold a charge for much longer than a day, and when it does, it is constantly hanging up, showing a ""half complete"" progress bar on the display. I called FitBit, and they led me through a process to remove the device, reset it, then add it, and this worked....for about an hour, then I once again got the 50% progress bar showing on the display. I called FitBit back, and they said there is nothing more they can do - the product is broken. They offered me a 25% discount on a new device, but how inclined do you think I am to buy a FIFTH FitBit product, based on the absolutely horrible quality I've seen with the first four?The tech support dude said they've improved the quality....WELL WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG, and IF YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH QUALITY, WHY AM I GOING TO HAVE TO BUY YET ANOTHER BRAND NEW PRODUCT?Original review: This is the fourth FitBit I've owned. The previous three were FitBit Flex's and all three suffered the same fate - the electronics detached from the band. In each case, FitBit replaced the faulty unit with a new one.All in all, I like the way they operate and how the FitBit's work, so I've remained loyal. In October of 2015 I decided to buy another one, and this time it was a Charge HR. Unfortunately, the back of the electronics case popped open last week, and I'm going to have to Super Glue it together, in much the same fashion as the last 3 Flex's I've had.How hard is it to make a product that, when used as designed, actually last longer than 18 months? Yes, I wear it every day, and most nights, but I don't wear it swimming, or in the shower, or while washing my car, doing dishes, etc...in other words, it's on my wrist but not exposed to any harsh conditions...and still, it's falling apart in the same way as earlier versions.It's out of warranty, so I'm stuck fixing it myself, or buying a replacement.Oh, and BTW, why is the Charge HR the ONLY FitBit that doesn't have the ability to show the battery level on the device's screen? You need to get this info from the app. Ironic that the Charge does not SHOW its charge, no?

  Pros:-HR seems very accurate-I love almost all the new features-Syncs well with iOS 14-Picks up on a lot of stuff and is very accurate-Comfy and looks nice, isn‚Äôt too bigCons:-Every time I move my hand back (pic above) it buzzes and turns on and off and it‚Äôs ANNOYING!! And it messes with features, such as; the timer when I‚Äôm running, going back to the Home Screen, and going to the settings. And it does that in my sleep.-So the way to fix this is to wear it higher on my wrist/forearm... but that‚Äôs not as comfortable.-I‚Äôve only had it for a day and I want to try it out for at least a week... but that‚Äôs just a dumb feature. I‚Äôd rather just tap the top to turn it on than press the sides. Who came up with that?- I don‚Äôt like that I run for 30 minutes but it changes it to a higher number because ‚Äúactive zone‚Äù or whatever gives you 2x the minutes. If I run for 30 minutes... I run for 30 minutes! It says I exercised for 99 minutes... but I only did 69 minutes. It gave me 2x the minutes. That‚Äôs just dumb and confusing.- I also don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt zoom in on my sleeping log and see the graph.Update: I‚Äôm returning it

  I purchased this Inspire 2 as in upgrade to my old Alta HR. I liked the Alta HR because it had a slim profile and was simple to use. The Inspire 2 has two flaws that are deal breakers for me. 1: you cannot change the ‚Äúapps‚Äù that display on the face - so if someone was looking at my Fitbit they could see my weight. I am a teacher, my students play with my Fitbit at times and I don‚Äôt need them to know that personal information. 2: Whenever my wrist and arm touch together, it makes my Fitbit vibrate. I have worn it for not even an hour and had to take it off because it was annoying.I spend nearly 1/2 an hour on the phone with Fitbit customer service for them to go through their whole speech, to find out these a ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that can‚Äôt be removed.

  My four year old Charge 2 HR battery was getting weak so I decide to buy a new Inspire 2 and I‚Äôm glad I did.First of all, it does everything and more than what my Charge 2 HR did for me, which was quite a lot.  Without taking advantage of the free Premium offer, all the data presentation I enjoyed with the older Charge 2 HR is included in Inspire 2.  Plus improvements in looks, screen brightness, a much longer battery life and a link to my phone GPS for improved tracking of my long walks.The negative reviews I‚Äôve read revolve mostly around the irritation of the vibration notifications.  To preempt those problems I immediately turned off almost all of the notifications.  Do you really need your watch tell you your phone is ringing?  Or you can‚Äôt remember that you‚Äôve been sitting in your chair for the last hour?The setup was super easy.  From your current app account, add a device and make sure it synchs to your new Inspire 2 so all of the data stored in your old Fitbit ports into you new device.  I just let the battery run out on my old Fitbit and will soon delete it from my account.For only $99 this is a great device.

  I'm really sad that this Inspire 2 is catching so much grief in the reviews here, but what I believe it boils down to is most people only leave bad reviews. If someone is happy with something they usually won't take the time to come on an write about it unless it is beyond brilliant. I wont go so far as to say this fitbit is that, but it is a wonderful gadget and personally I find no truths in what many here are complaining about. Firstly I would like to start with, if comparing to the HR and making a decision between the two, definitely go with the newer model. It does more; like the 24/7 heart rate monitor which is really great to keep an eye on, the active zones and a great battery life. So far I've gone 4 days with no charge and only gotten to 65%, that's incredible to me. Not to mention this new model includes a free year of premium which has a lot of great stuff in it like fitness guides and mediation exercises.When I was making the decision I read pros and cons comparisons and ultimately it was these and the sluggish touch screen on the HR that led me to choose the Inspire 2. I'm glad I did, I have zero regrets. And for some reason this is cheaper right now than the older model! (Edit: it looks like that was  pre holiday sale and it's more expensive now which does make sense, it is better) It's functioning flawlessly. It was a great price, is very easy to use, and really is a good little motivator.I love the gentle alarms, the relax exercises, and the little reminders to drink water and exercise. The sleep tracking is really fascinating and a personal goal of mine to work on, this is a major help to me in that regard. I love that it is swim safe as well, since I'm big on swimming.I have pretty small wrists, and while it sits off of it a bit, it's not overly bulky and is light, and by no means bothersome.Also the recommendation for wearing it is slightly loose, not snug, and I find the best position for it is just above the ulna.As far as people having trouble with it getting stuck on one screen and always showing their weight or constantly buzzing with alerts? That is 100% user error. I will say with confidence if you take your time to sit down and just read through and explore the app with patience, it is all very user friendly. These screens can be backed out of, changed, and alarms/ reminders set or cancelled.There was also a review that mentioned there's no way to view the HR on the main screen, and you have to swipe through 5 times or so to get to it. While that is one way, there is also the quick function on the home screen just below the clock, tapping this will cycle through which to display (HR, calories, active zones, miles, and steps) so you can have your HR and time visible anytime.My two biggest ""issues"" with it which are very minor, would be the band, which tends to irritate the skin slightly with constant wear. Cleaning, switching wrists or bands is a simple solution.The other one is that the steps aren't incredibly accurate, they give a rough idea, but I tend to halve mine based off of my walking routes that I know. This is a broad guess on my part, steps matter least to me but it's probably closer to 75% accurate.Keeping that and the relatively low price in mind, I think this is a wonderful all over health tracker and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality tracker at a reasonable price and healthier lifestyle. It is a small piece of plastic that I find quite incredible at what it is capable of doing for being so tiny, and am amazed at all of the extras in this!

  I have the Alta HR and the face is pretty scratched.  I have short arms so all the Fitbits are too large.  I was so excited when this came in yesterday and it is about the same size as my Alta.  But then every time I bent my wrist and it had skin to skin contact it immediately vibrated.  There are no buttons just to turn it on, you just finger touch both sides.  Obviously you flex your wrist all day.  All of those vibrations every 2 minutes or sooner is a hard fail and there isn't a touch sensitivity that you can play with.  My other problem is that it didn't give me the reminders to move, even though I had it turned on.  So it's being returned and back to my scratched Alta :-(

  I have mixed feelings so far about the Fitbit Ace:The positive: my son enjoys it and is actively looking at the number of steps he has made, comparing them to where I am at.  In this respect it is doing what I had hoped.The negative:  the software is buggy and hard to use; as stated before, going back to parent‚Äôs mode (e.g. seeing my statistics) is very cumbersome as someone already described.  You have to go back through the menus, scroll, enter password, re-enter username, then enter password again.Second, entering my child‚Äôs information was annoying in that I didn‚Äôt get a confirmation that the account was created.  The first time I tried creating the account I got a message saying the username was already taken.  I then proceeded to try another username.  After entering the information, I saw the same screen again where you enter your child‚Äôs information.  Thinking that I picked another common username, I proceeded to try a couple more ideas.  I didn‚Äôt realize that I was actually creating four accounts.  The problem is that you can‚Äôt immediately delete the extra accounts ‚Äì Fitbit has a seven day ‚Äògrace period‚Äô where you have to wait until the account is actually removed.  Now I have a bunch of similar accounts on my phone.Perhaps because of the above, I can‚Äôt finish pairing the Ace to my phone.  I keep getting an error message that I, nor customer support, has been able to resolve.  So, at this point the Fitbit is tracking my son‚Äôs use without me being able to view or save it to my phone.Hopefully after the seven day wait period clears up in trying to delete these extra accounts I can pair the device...The interface / setup with the child's account needs better design.

  Only tracks steps and sleep.  It doesn‚Äôt do anything else.  I would hope it at least track some type of exercise.  Also the switch to kids view and parent view takes too many taps and sometimes it hangs and you have login again.  It needs major improvement.  The last problem was amazon reduce the price from 130 to 80 bucks right after I bought it.  I thought about returning it and getting the cheaper price but didn‚Äôt feel like doing the setup again.1.  It should come with kids‚Äô Fitbit app, so we can install it on their kindle or apple iPad/touch.. or in the same phone as the parent - perhaps require a parent account when installing in other device2.  It needs to be able to detect some basic exercise like running, biking, playing sports, and monkeying around3.  Allow the parents to send a message to the ace if connected nearby.4.  The set up was not intuitive, a techie like me had issues and had to call tech support.

  Reasonably priced - pretty much the same price as the adult Alta,  which makes sense, because pretty much it IS the Adult Alta but with a smaller band and the ability to use the children‚Äôs app which allows parent control of settings and data.

  Bought this Fitbit for my 11-year-old daughter a couple of weeks ago. When we first opened the package, we thought that the wristband would be too small for her, but it fits with 3 openings for her to grow into. So far, she has enjoyed having it. Her name is under my account (I also have a Fitbit) and I like that. We haven't been able to figure out how she can connect her Fitbit to other Fitbit friends (for example to her grandparents who also have Fitbits). Am hoping Fitbit will include that in a future software update. We have done a few races for footsteps against each other and that's a real motivator for each of us to compete for more daily footsteps. My 8-year-old is a little jealous and wants to join in on the fun.

  The band on the Ace is too small it doesn‚Äôt fit my 10 year old average sized daughter. Fitbit customer service told me I could order an Alta band to fit. This is very disappointing since I have to pay another $30 for a band. Would be better if they actually made a band that fit older kids. I would say that the band is made for kids 4-8 not 8+ because it fits my 6 year old perfectly

  I bought this for my 10 year old and the band didn't fit her so I had to buy adult size bands.  The idea is cool but the functionality is really limited.  I should have just purchased her an alta, more than likely I'll end of giving her my charge 2 and getting a new one.

  We continually have trouble getting it to automatically sync. Have Googled for help and it seems the only way around it is to plug it into the USB and turn it off (press button on charger 3 times), then it reboots, at which time it will sync. Otherwise like it and it is successful at motivating my child to be more active. Note that the band that comes with it is way too small for my 11 year old. Fits better on my 6 year old. We bought generic Alta bands instead.

  I'm sorry to see others haven't had a great experience with this product, but I'm very happy so far! I have an average size 9 year old and the band fits him perfectly with room to grow.

  The recharger is awful. the cord is only about 3"" long, and it's VERY awkward to keep it attached to the fitbit - it might be a little easier if I unattached the straps to the fitbit, but that adds another awkward step to the process.

  I had the Fitbit Alta HR and I think that the Inspire HR fits more comfortably, but there are some features of the Alta I like better.  When you swipe to see different screens you have to do it perfectly straight or it hardly gives you time to look before it disappears.Also I played tennis for 2 hours today and it only gave me 18 minutes of exercise time.  I know that I moved for more than 18 minutes. Sometimes it seems to work better if I put it in my pocket.  But same thing happened with the Alta.  Not sorry I bought it, but somewhat disappointed.

  I've been a Fitbit user since the first one hit the market, and I've had numerous models over the years. On paper the Inspire HR fit my needs almost perfectly: it has a heart rate monitor, a sleep monitor (though I would only trust the results as general trends), and the step counter checks relatively closely to other devices I have compared it to, so I'm pleased with that in a small, unobtrusive package that holds its battery charge well (I charge mine once to twice a week).Why the two-star rating with all those positives? First, I'm actually on my second Inspire HR because the first one was plagued with repeated synching problems and frequently refused to take a charge, and that's the crux of the matter. The charger for this device is the worst I have ever seen on any electronic device, ever. It features an extremely short cord and is held to the back of the Fitbit very precariously by a weak magnet. It's hard to get the pins aligned just right, and I frequently come back after an hour of ""charging"" to discover it has not been charging. Sometimes you'll have to do a reset of the whole thing to get it to take a charge; on the upside, once it actually is charging it charges very rapidly.When the Inspire HR works like it's supposed to it's a great unit. I can't in good conscience recommend it, however, due to the routine problems with syncing and charging in both of the Inspire HRs I have owned.

  I purchased this item from Target. I‚Äôve owned a handful of fitness trackers in the past, but never one from the Fitbit brand. My Garmin devices (Vivofit 2, Vivosmart HR, Vivofit 3) served me well in terms of functionality, but they never seemed to hold my attention. That is to say, the user interface, while functional and useful, simply was not that...inspiring (excuse the ridiculous pun). It wasn‚Äôt very fun. I know that‚Äôs not important to everyone, but the Fitbit app and UI are so much more engaging and easy to use. The Garmin devices I sort of just wore and didn‚Äôt think much about, but this device and the accompanying app keeps me interested and motivated all day and night long. It‚Äôs also an all-in-one solution for me, as opposed to using multiple apps to sync all of my info together to create a complete picture that I can use to motivate myself to be better and do better.We all know the accuracy of all fitness trackers is highly debated and, to be honest, I‚Äôve finally managed to accept that and just keep in mind that the info I‚Äôm getting is an approximation. I have found the accuracy to be perfectly acceptable for my needs‚Äîit is useful information to work with, regardless of the hyperspecific levels of accuracy of the device. The trends are what matters. The consistency of the device‚Äôs info from day to day is ultimately more important than the fact that no, this is not a medical-grade device that will nail every piece of info to a T. And that consistency is certainly there. As far as I know, there are no user-friendly, portable, wearable devices out there that can tout perfect accuracy. The human body‚Äôs mechanisms are far too complex to measure precisely. These trackers are motivational and informational tools. And, for most users, I think this device is perfectly suited to that. It‚Äôs fun to use, looks streamlined and fairly fashionable (or at least unassuming), and comfortable to wear. It seems to be fairly accurate (at least as accurate, if not more, than devices I‚Äôve used in the past‚Äîpositioning of the device away from the wrist one and wearing it snugly helps out here). The app is an amazing companion.No tracker is perfect. It‚Äôs unfair to expect that, at least at this point in time.This device is amazingly priced for what you get, looks good, feels good, and does its job well. I know it‚Äôs only been two days, but it‚Äôs already got me up and moving more than I would be otherwise. At a glance, I can see my steps, heart rate, calories burned, notifications from my phone, water intake, etc. AKA everything it is advertised to do. I have high hopes for the future with it. I do hope it remains durable over time. The fact that it is waterproof was a selling point for me; I simply do not wish to be concerned with a splash or a shower completely destroying the device.I would recommend it to those looking for a fun and functional tracker that won‚Äôt quite break the bank. It does what it claims to do and it does those things well. Frankly, I love it. Some folks may find it does not meet their expectations, but I‚Äôd argue that those folks simply need to look to other devices with capabilities that are simply more in line with what they want to get out of the device. This is not a super-advanced device. But that‚Äôs not what it claims to be. And for the average person like myself, it‚Äôs perfectly adequate for fitness tracking purposes, and has met and exceeded my expectations so far. It gives that motivation and inspiration, and it gives the right information to work off of in order to make progress toward better fitness and health.

  i went to go buy the Charge 3, at Walmart- and they were sold out. THANK GOD YALL. I went to the Fitbit website and seen that they were dropping a few new watches. I have owned 3 other Fitbit watches. I have owned the Alta without the hr monitor- which I loved the most because of its slim design, but also disliked because it didn‚Äôt have the hr tracker. The band was annoying, because it would pop off when I did several wrist motions, or hit a corner. Due to that, I actually lost it. Then I owned the Fitbit Charge HR 2, it helped me lose 30 pounds! However I have extremely sensitive skin and no matter how much I cleaned it, I kept getting irritable rashes, and with no interchangeable bands- I gave the product to a friend of mine. Then I had the Fitbit versa, and it was just too large and dull for my liking. I left it in a friends car and it was stolen, thank god because now we‚Äôre here. I preordered this watch, and watched reviews on it, and critics were saying the wrist band material is different, so I didn‚Äôt immediately buy an interchangeable (only the IQ Shield, which I highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the service industry, spend a significant time outdoors,or if you‚Äôre as clumsy as me). And well the band is stunning. Matte black silicone, it‚Äôs very light and smooth! I also have a ganglion cyst on my left wrist (reoccurring) that my physician says is due to lifting heavyweights (heavyweight lifter for 14 years). Usually these trackers would immediately agitate the cyst in this weird pulsing like way, but nada. For the price and function of this watch, I don‚Äôt see how anyone couldn‚Äôt rate it any lower than a 4. I‚Äôm extremely pleased and I hope the pedometer works better than the previous ones with my jogger (stroller). I‚Äôll update that after the weather clears. Also, after setup my watch had a hard time syncing to the app, if this happens to you just exit the app and reopen it a little later. Is it annoying? Maybe, but not as annoying as taking your watch off every time you shower, bath your kid, or aggressively wash your hands in the service industry. ALSO, this watch displays the date, which apparently the charge 3 does not, so exited!

  I‚Äôve been using Fitbit for 4 years. This is my 4th one. I started with the charge and when the band broke off, they sent me a new one. I switched to the alta later and really liked the sleekness of it, but wasn‚Äôt impressed with the features. The charge was better as far as more features and options. I have been looking for a something with a small band and face with gps and heart rate monitor for hiking. I was thrilled when they released the inspire hr. It has everything I was expecting and more. I have not had a single issue with it. The charger cord is short but so were the last two. I have always plugged my usb cubes into extension cords and never had an issue with charging. The battery lasts about 4-5 days. I love how it tracks my sleep cycles (awake, light sleep, deep sleep and rem). The gps function is awesome and links with Strava. I like to track long hikes and walks and compare stats because I‚Äôm training for a backpacking trip and need to get a sense of pace and timing. It‚Äôs also great to see my heart rate during rest and activity. I‚Äôve read some other reviews that this Fitbit has several bugs. It seems I lucked out this time around. Hopefully Fitbit fixes them. I‚Äôm a happy camper and will be keeping this one.

  Overall this had potential.  It was bought for my mother.  She is in her 70s.  She found it very difficult to push the metal tabs from one of the wrist straps into the holes of the other.  She assumed they would loosen from wear, but after a few weeks it was still near impossible.  I assume they want you to wear it all the time, so they made it hard to keep it on through sleep, etc.  It is kind of like a home detention monitoring device ;)  I'm sure they get a higher price for selling our life patterns to marketing companies if this includes sleep history.  You can target those with sleep problems with pill and cpap ads ;) Too bad, she had tried several cheaper ones that didn't hold up.  If any finds a decent watch with a pedometer built-in reply to this comment.

  I am disappointed that the fitbit doesn't register many of the workouts I do.  Like lifting weights and the recumbent bike.  Nearly an hour of strenuous biking registers 33 minutes of strenuous exercise.  Zero minutes on the treadmill.  Also, I've been to Arizona and back to Utah twice since I purchased the watch.  Driving home, we cross into Utah, back into Arizona, then back into Utah.  It stays on Arizona time the 2nd time back into Utah.  So, it's basically been an hour behind for the last 8 weeks.  Boo!  The only thing it's good for is to remind me that I need to exercise.

By 900pm it told me I had 25% and needed to charge it.  I thought this wad a new Fitbit. They never seem to hold a charge or last a year anymore.

  Based on my search, I thought I was ordering the newer version of my Alta HR but it‚Äôs not. Doesn‚Äôt have any HR monitoring or sleep patterns. I wore it a day thinking I just didn‚Äôt have it synced right so didn‚Äôt feel like I could return it after warring it. Really don‚Äôt like the band because it‚Äôs hard to clasp using one hand.

  i first ordered this fitbit and it came with a broken charger. i was able to return it and purchased another one. Now this one has stopped working after a month and half. just beyond the 30 days that you have to return the item. I cannot give negative stars so I put in only 1. i don't know what has happened to fit bit but their quality has gone down. i have to recommend that you buy another product.

  Received my Fitbit and was never able to connect it to the internet so it never worked.  Had to send it back to Fitbit at my expense.  Several weeks later I received a new Fitbit which does work.

  This review is for the Fitbit brand leather strap in black, size small.This band runs very small. The leather band was even smaller than the original rubber one in the same size.I really don't love that for $100 this band contains nickel. It is very lightweight, but feels kind of cheap.... For certain, not worth that amount of money.I would have appreciated an option to spend less and receive only the band without the frame.Sending this back and not sure if I'll be ordering the large...

  Upon receipt of this Charge HR, I immediately charged it and attempted to set it up, on my iPad, in the app.  It never ‚Äúupdated‚Äù and it would not ‚Äúreset‚Äù to factory defaults.  I called FitBit and, after MANY troubleshooting procedures, was told that it was defective.  They decided to send me a new one.  Unfortunately, I was sent a ‚ÄúCharge 2 (different accessories/charger/wrist bands, etc.), due to the Charge HR being ‚Äúobsolete.‚Äù  While FitBit (the company) was very kind and proactive, I ordered this older version because, over the years, I had spent A LOT of money on accessories for it and wanted to continue to use them.  I am VERY disappointed that this Charge HR was useless.

  I got it today. It was dead when it arrived. I plugged it in to charge and set it up while charging. Once it was fully charged I put it on and went about my day. 2 hours later, it died. So this item is pretty much useless. I love Fitbit, and I've had several. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED! Returning tomorrow for a full refund towards a new model.

  Got this after my charge 2 died and wow is it and upgrade I really love it so far! Fair warning though on some things I didn‚Äôt realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you‚Äôre exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to ‚Äúwork properly‚Äù I don‚Äôt like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven‚Äôt had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way. My boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when I toss and turn at night I don‚Äôt accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off.

  I won't be like everyone who gives a bad review because they clearly got a dud (or user-error as it often is). I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.

  Fitbit's App:Let me start by saying, the Fitbit app is unparalleled for sleep, diet and water tracking. I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.

  I finally received my Fitbit and unfortunately it just has a black screen. I followed all directions, which is charging it and pairing it up to my phone. But as it was paring, the screen just turned black and when my phone tries to finish the set up and asks me for a 4 number pin, I can't type them in because I can't see them. I tried a reset by placing the fitbit on a charger, and nothing happened. There is a vibration when I press the button, but nothing more. I really needed this to work by tomorrow and now this happens. It's a great disappointment.

  I have tried a number of fitness trackers including Jawbone (regular, not 24), FitBit Flex, Garmin VivoFit and even Microsoft Band.  I think this is the best.  Here's how I would compare the 4:Jawbone - I liked the Web site, the silent alarm and the battery life, but that's about it.  The biggest issue I have with many bands including this one is how bulky it is.  Of course, the manual syncing also is annoying.FitBit Flex - it has the silent alarm, automatic syncing and you forget about it during the day because it is not very bulky.  But it lacks the impressive display of FitBit Charge (see below)Garmin VivoFit - I liked the display and the lack of bulkiness, but the app was awful.  You also couldn't see it at night, nor did it feature a silent alarm.Microsoft Band - if you could jam the functionality of the Microsoft Band into the Fitbit Charge, you would have the perfect tracker.  The problem, however, is that the Band is very thick and you have to flip it over to read the display.  The clasp is on top and the display under your wrist.  It reminded me of my 4th grade math teacher who always checked his watch by flipping it over.FitBit Charge - looks great, silent alarm, bright display, accurate, double tap for important information.  You don't notice it's on your wrist which is one of my main prerequisites for fitness trackers.  One feature I think is pretty cool is the goal achievement silent alarm.  So let's say you want to walk 10k steps per day.  Once you do, the band buzzes and when you look at the display, you are heartily congratulated for your accomplishment.  The other cool feature is if you hold the button, you tell the tracker you are in ""activity"" mode.  A timer begins and the distance you cover is tracked.  Perfect for a run.Of the trackers out on the market November, 2014, this is the best.  Soon it will be yesterday's new especially when Apple Watch redefines the wearable market.  But right now, it is the most well-rounded tracker out there.

  I bought a Fitbit Charge 15 months ago. I was pretty happy with it initially, seemed to work well, user friendly etc. But within 8 months the band failed. I called customer service and they replaced it. I should also mention that during the same period the exact same thing happened to my husband. My replacement had some firmware issues but after a long session with customer service, they were able to fix those by remote. I feel like this unit is more stingy about allocating steps, but it basically seems to work okay. Fast forward to this month, 6 months from receiving the replacement, and this band has failed as well. Called customer service and the best they would offer was a 25% discount on a replacement, which isn't even any better an offer than their sale prices. Um.... no. I get that it's out of warranty but one quick Google session will clearly indicate this is incredibly common and obviously a design flaw. I've had $30 Timex watches with better quality bands. Fitbit needs to design better bands or at least make these things so you can replace the band without replacing the whole unit. They know this is an issue and they are refusing to stand behind their product. Unless you are one of those people who is happy to upgrade all their tech devices every year, and consign the derelicts to the landfill, I'd say steer clear of this company.

  I like all the features that this FitBit band has to offer, such as time, monitoring sleep activity, and counting the # of floors climbed, but the battery life is AWFUL!!! Which is why I only gave it 2 stars. On the FitBit website, it says this band's battery life is 7-10 days depending upon usage. Well, mine ONLY has enough battery to last HALF A DAY! Which means, I have to charge it twice a day, (every single day).... once in the morning after I wake up and once before I go to bed or it will die while I'm sleeping. This is super ANNOYING! I could be getting more steps in during the day if it wasn't sitting on the charger!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU FITBIT. I WILL NOT be buying another one!UPDATE: 8/23/16After 6 months of use, this FitBit is done. Permanently dead. WHAT A JOKE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

  UPDATE:  I have had the watch from 10/2019-1/19/2020 and the band has ripped already.  I really liked by fitbit charge, until I noticed it was ripped on 1/19/2020. (I have to change my rating to 1/5 stars). Photos posted with review:  one phot shows the Fitbit charge when I purchased it and the other photo shows where it ripped...ORIGINAL POST WAS WRITTEN 10/2019 (4/5 stars was given:The Fitbit charge 1 is made from the same material as the Fitbit Flex.  The difference between the Charge 1 & the Flex is that the charge is a little thicker, has a screen where you can see your results, and has caller Id.note:  Setting up the Charge was a pain!  When you take it out of the box to charge it and if it doesn‚Äôt hold a charge, plug it into a computer to charge the first time...I don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt receive text notifications, but its cool to get call notifications.ALLERGIES:  I was able to wear both the Fitbit flex and the Fitbit Charge 1, without having any reactions.

  On paper, the Charge 3 had everything I ever hoped for in a fitness tracker. Heart rate monitoring, sleep analysis and oh yes, it is waterproof! The feature that would allow me to ware this potentially amazing piece of tech during lap swimming and during outside sport activities in the rain and snow. I was thrilled... that was until I received it and stuck it on my wrist.Here we go:-shuts off randomly (4 times I had to hard reset)-will randomly un-sync-inaccurate step counts-battery life indicator is not accurate-wonky heart rate monitoring (sometimes over and under estimates, or doesn't show up at all)-clock faces are horrible (appears you can only have 3 indicators on at once, thus can not have steps, time, date and HR on at the same time)-I have spent more time troubleshooting the charge 3 than actually enjoying it.-fitbit community slow to respond to problems.Please fitbit, just fix this thing so we can stop complaining. It is a dream  fitness tracker with so much potential but falls short in its current state. I will update this review once all problems are resolved.TLDR: Great potential but too buggy for everyday use. Wait until its fixed to purchase.

  Very disappointed.  If you want to see a date on a watch, don‚Äôt bother buying this version. If you are happy with your charge 2 clock faces, don‚Äôt buy this version. What do I get to see?  A nasty formatted clock and my heart rate. I can‚Äôt even choose what to see like the previous version. The only way to see my steps on the main screen is to view a true clock face and then small steps. I‚Äôm a long time Fitbit customer, but this one is being returned. Guess I will stick with my charge 2 until I find a new company. I can‚Äôt even fathom why a company goes backwards with functionality. I mean, why would someone want a date on a watch?  Why would I want to see my steps (or miles, or whatever my choice) as well. I don‚Äôt care about my heart rate on the main screen unless I‚Äôm exercising.

  I've used an Alta for a couple of years and figured it was time for an upgrade. I was waiting to see what Fitbit had coming before jumping on something else. I'm not a huge fan of smartwatches so I wasn't interested in the more fully featured Fitbit products. Seeing the Charge 3 released prompted me to consider it.Coming from an Alta, I was a bit concerned about the size. This has not been a problem. It's larger, sure, but it fits the wrist nicely and isn't heavy at all. I have not had any comfort issues. I ordered a different style band, however, more along the lines of what I'm use to using.The Charge 3 has a lot more power and features than the Alta, so my opinion of it may be a bit rose tinted compared to those coming from the Charge 2. The battery life is great. The usability is great. The features are much more extensive. I, especially, like seeing my estimated sleep stages, and my heart rate info. I'm looking forward to the update that enables the SpO2 functionality.As I noted, I'm not a fan of smartwatches. I disabled notifications on my Alta, and, even though I can see more details about my notifications on the Charge 3, I'm likely to turn that down or off. I'm the type of person that doesn't need to immediately see what my phone just beeped about, as I'd rather keep my attention on the task or event at hand. I will note that the vibrate is quite powerful, though.It's nice to have an altimeter again. My Fitbit One had this, but for some reason the Alta excluded it. As I've pushed myself to take the stairs more and more, I love being able to track it again.The one flaw I'll note, and it's enough to knock a star off, is the auto brightness doesn't seem to dim enough in low light. Just by moving at night, the brightness of the display has woken me up because it was right next to my eyes. As I saw one person put it, the brightness of the display burns like that of a thousand suns. I've noticed the auto brightness seems to do something sometimes, but it doesn't dim near enough in the dark and can be quite jarring when not expected.As this was just released, I'm sure all the software faults, that of the missing features in the watch faces noted by others, and the auto brightness issue, etc, will be fixed in due time. Overall, this is a nice upgrade from the Alta and will keep me on the Fitbit platform for another couple of years, I'm sure.

  Pros:__________‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs very comfortable. When you wear the Versa 2, the weight is balanced enough that it doesn‚Äôt bring any discomfort, and light enough to sometimes forget you have it on.‚Ä¢ The design is almost identical to an Apple Watch. With square rounded corners, it‚Äôs almost impossible to tell the difference if you had both of them side by side.‚Ä¢ I had no discomfort wearing this Fitbit when I slept and had no itchy feeling around my skin when I woke up. Overall, you can wear this all day without any issues.‚Ä¢ The screen has great contrast, vivid colors, and has excellent brightness. On a clear sunny day, I put this display to the test and it passed with flying color. Outstanding outdoor viewability.‚Ä¢ The Alexa feature does work. I did like the fact that with you can speak to this watch as if it was a smartphone, and Alexa will answer to you (in text). Weather report, nearby stores, and overall a quick way to get an answer (More details later on).‚Ä¢ Fitbit is pushing this Versa 2 into the world of smartwatches, as you‚Äôre able to control any of your smart home devices with this watch. I only have some smart light bulbs, so my testing was turning them on and off with this Fitbit. Please to say that it worked flawlessly.‚Ä¢ I felt the sleep scoring system was pretty accurate. I tested it for almost a week and the graph displaying for my sleep fit my experience. Fitbit always does a great job providing your data in a visually appealing look on the app and in desktop form.‚Ä¢ The alarm feature is very useful. When the Versa 2 is tracking your sleep, it will find the best time to wake you up before you ‚Äúactually‚Äù have to wake up. Everyone has a different sleep cycle (light and deep sleepers) so you may expect a different outcome. Usually, it‚Äôs within the 30-minute time frame before your alarm is set.‚Ä¢ The other fitness programs in the Fitbit (activity trackers, heart rate, distance travel, calories burned, and so forth) are all decently accurate and effective. This technology isn‚Äôt new, but Fitbit does make fitness trackers that are consumer-friendly. You‚Äôll be surprised how complex some tracker out there are. If you had the previous Versa, you should expect the same layout.‚Ä¢ Some features like the Relax app (guides you through breathing exercises), movement reminders (lets you know when you been sitting for too long) and step counts all stimulated me to be more active. It‚Äôs hard to explain but when you see your progress on a graph, or even a number, you feel compelled to keep growing it. Because of Fitbit‚Äôs friendly visual graphs, you don‚Äôt have to write anything and overall it brings a form of motivation to keep increasing your numbers.‚Ä¢ Numerous exercise modes, training guides, and even 10-minute training cycles. Like I mention before, if you need something to motivate you to work out, this will be it.‚Ä¢ One of the best features in the Always-On-Display. I‚Äôm a huge fan of this because you‚Äôre not wearing the watch every second of your life. It‚Äôs nice to see that you can leave it on a table and the display will still viewable, like any other watch.‚Ä¢ Third-party apps like Uber are available for this watch. I don‚Äôt use Uber, but it‚Äôs good to know that third-party app companies are putting their foot in Fitbit.‚Ä¢ Going for a jog, the watch vibrates when I get a notification, which is just a text for me. It‚Äôs also pretty straight forward in deciding what you want to be notified about.‚Ä¢ Yes, you can swim with it. Haven‚Äôt tested this out though.‚Ä¢ Battery life is good, compared to the other smartwatches out there. Around 3 days of use before I need to charge it. Maybe 2 if I‚Äôm using it a lot, and the Always-On-Display is on max brightness.Cons and Oks:__________‚Ä¢ There is a connectivity issue that I‚Äôm dealing with my Versa. It would disconnect from my phone and would take numerous times in trying to reconnect it. I have no idea why it‚Äôs doing this  but I‚Äôve noticed past reviews online addressing the same issue. It has to be a software problem because others are not getting this issue as well. Be on the lookout.‚Ä¢ Another issue with the connectivity is you won‚Äôt know if there is no connection until you physically look at the display. This is a huge issue if you have notifications, texts, and updates coming from your phone to this watch. If the watch is disconnected, and your phone is not with you, you may miss some important stuff.‚Ä¢ On the display, I felt Fitbit‚Äôs main icons are very unclear. What I liked about Android and Apple is that even if you never used there OS, you can tell where to go with the icons they provide you. The icons that Fitbit provide are very unclear and if you don‚Äôt use this device often you‚Äôre going to be lost in there OS.‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre paying decent money for the device but Fitbit restricts a lot of it as they want you to sign up for their monthly ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù services. This monthly Fitbit service offers a great deal of programs, but if you don‚Äôt want to pay a monthly payment then you‚Äôre stuck with the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù software of the watch.‚Ä¢ No idea why Fitbit did this but you can‚Äôt stream Spotify on this watch unless you have premium Spotify subscription. Not only that but you can‚Äôt even allow playback from this device to your speakers, phone, etc. I hope they fix this as it seems you need to pay more to use the watch fully.‚Ä¢ Alexa provides the basics of communication but other than that I found it useless. The voice recognition lacks useful search results and since there are no built-in speakers, you‚Äôll never get any audio notifications and hear Alexa‚Äôs answers. Middle of a workout, you will have to stop and look at the text that Alexa provides.‚Ä¢ To even use Alexa, you need to install Amazon‚Äôs Alexa‚Äôs app on the phone and have an account with it.‚Ä¢ No integration with Apple Health and Google fit. You have to stick with Fitbit all the way.‚Ä¢ No GPS. You need to connect it to your phone to all GPS tracking. Without it, this creates a reduction in accuracy when you run. I didn‚Äôt find it to be that much off, but it‚Äôs enough that I think you should know.‚Ä¢ Has some thick bezels around the screen.‚Ä¢ If you want to change the strap, expect a fight. Fitbit locks the brands pretty solid, so taking them out ain't going to be fun.‚Ä¢ I wish that you can customize the Always-on-display because currently, it‚Äôs a very simple layout. Not customizable to your choosing.‚Ä¢ Currently I can‚Äôt respond to text messages with this watch with my iPhone, but you can use this feature on an Android.‚Ä¢ I notice that Fitbit doesn‚Äôt have a payment system of their own. When you want to buy an app, you‚Äôre going to paying directly to the developer, where they can use any payment system they want. So far this isn‚Äôt an issue but it‚Äôs something to note in the long run due to security reasons.‚Ä¢ You can‚Äôt even store your favorite apps for quick access.‚Ä¢ Up 300 songs you can store on the desktop Fitbit app, but you have to transfer them over WIFI. No wire transfer and depending on your WIFI speed, it will take some time.‚Ä¢ When you get a notification, or ask Alexa a question, you‚Äôre going to get a one-sentence answer. Numerous times I found this frustrating because you‚Äôre not getting any context to help you, and it just leads you to want more.‚Ä¢ Your phone needs to be with you to fully use this watch. The Versa is an accessory to your phone.Bottom Line:__________It‚Äôs not a smartwatch for your phone. You have to get on board with this idea before you buy this watch. The point of Fitbit is to have a digital fitness book on you at all times. With the Versa 2, It‚Äôs a fitness book that does all the writing, tracking, and you‚Äôre only requirement is to workout. This is what Fitbit does a great job in. It provides you as much detail as you need on exercises, your workout routines, and your health. I felt the need to check on my stats every day as it‚Äôs one of the few devices that can visually show you that you‚Äôre improving. A light device, excellent display, and a great motivation tool.But you need to put it in your head, it‚Äôs not a smartwatch. The Apple Watch is a smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch is a smartwatch, and this isn‚Äôt. Unlike other smartwatches, once you buy this, you still need to pay more to have the full experience. Fitbit premium ‚Äúmonthly‚Äù services provide a great deal of data and programs to help you out, but you need to pay for it. Even with the payment you still need to have your phone around as Alexa currently isn‚Äôt useful enough other than asking for the weather. With no built-in GPS tracking, limited text/notification updates, and Spotify restriction, you can see why this isn‚Äôt in the same category with Apple and Samsung.This is a fitness tool to help you keep your body in shape. Fitbit does a great job in that, but if you‚Äôre looking for a smartwatch then go over to Apple and Samsung. Those are smartwatches, this isn‚Äôt.Overall: A virtual fitness book that is a must-have for those who want to get in shape but has too many issues to be called a real smartwatch.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

  The Versa 2 brings some modest improvements to the original, both inside and out. Here are some highlights:The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone. A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day. If you have an iPhone I don't know why you're reading this.

  ¬†Another update before I return my watch for the second time: it‚Äôs 5:36am and my watch says that I slept 8 hours. I‚Äôll upload the imagine. I went to bed at 11:15 and woke up at 5 am. I can‚Äôt believe how off the sleeping app is today.An update: my Sister got a new Fitbit versa for me again and I wore both Apple Watch and Fitbit Watch. The step count was very different. Almost 3 thousand more steps with the Fitbit. It counted extra 800 steps while I was in the resting position. Ones again I contacted the Fitbit asking them why this has happened, they told me Apple and other devices  count steps differently. 2856 step difference is huge though.My wife just got her Fitbit Versa 2 yesterday and went swimming with it as it today. The watch initially worked for a few minutes while using the swimming app. After 20 minutes she came out and the watch was totally off. We tried to charge it everything but it seams that it got water fried. It‚Äôs supposed to be water resistant up to 50 meters!  The pink band was bought separately. Original was purple. Had exactly same problem with last generation Versa. And from googling it seams that we are not alone with this problem. I returned my watch and asked Fitbit if they would give a discount if I buy a new watch they said they will not. Well I guess I‚Äôll just save up extra and get an Apple Watch. Will definitely send all the videos I had made to the bloggers so others won‚Äôt make the same mistake.

  Let me start by saying that I am first time Fitbit and Apple watch user. I couldn't find a lot of reviews comparing the two, so I decided to purchase both and return one of them. Which one is better? Well that depends on what you're using it for.A little about me: I'm a 29 year old guy who works out 3-5 days a week with weights and runs 2-4 miles a day at an 8:30-9:00 minute pace. I work as a Resident Physician in a busy ER and originally wanted a pedometer see how much I walk in a given work day.Appearance and build quality: Winner- AppleFirst up was the Fitbit charge 2. The packaging was great, very ""Apple"" like, but the build quality of the device left something to be desired. The band is made of a comfortable silicone and the display appears to be a ""cheap"" appearing plastic. While the device won't impress on looks, it is somewhat low profile and and comfortable on the wrist. The screen itself isn't the most responsive, but it works well enough. The display is bright and easily visible. I did not have trouble seeing the screen outdoors.The apple watch was everything you'd expect from an Apple product. Sleek, responsive, and user friendly. I'd stop short of calling it ""stylish"", but it feels noticeably more polished than the FitbitFitness: Winner- FitbitHere's where the two products completely diverge. I found the Fitbit to be an incredible fitness device compared to the Apple watch. Everything is streamlined for fitness with the Fitbit, while the apple watch is cluttered and optimized as a ""smart watch"". With a quick glance on the fitbit I can see the time, my steps taken, and heart rate. It takes just seconds to set up a workout and scroll the the menus. The beauty of fitbit lies in it's simplicity. The apple watch can also show steps taken, and heart rate, but does not give you continuous monitoring of heart rate like the fitbit. The fitbit can also track sleep, and give you an estimate of your cardio fitness score (V02 Max).Other features: Clearly the fitbit is not a smart watch, but the text and call notifications are great when you're working out and don't have quick access to your phone. Yes, you can't see the whole text, but i'm not using this feature to replace my phone, I'm using it to screen for important texts or calls that I would need to stop my workout for. The apple watch on the other hand can text, call, and use many of the same apps as your iPhone. If you have apple music you can also listen to music on Bluetooth headphones. The built in GPS and waterproofing are great features as well.Accuracy: TieI have no idea what the negative reviews are talking about (Maybe they received a defective device or have exceptionally hairy arms?). The fitbit is impressively accurate with resting and active heart rate. I've compared manual hearts and treadmill measurements with a variation of +/- 5 while active and +/- 2 at rest. I don't care if my real heart is 155 or 158 while I workout, I just want to know what zone i'm in. My run this morning was within .03 miles of my phone GPS, and the pace was spot on. Good enough for me, but i'm not a competitive runner. The apple watch is slightly more accurate when it comes to distance, and probably more suited for someone who runs at a competitive pace. Steps taken? I give the edge to fitbit. Apple watch skipped a lot of my steps and took a while to update. Yes, the fitbit adds 20-30 steps while I sleep, and another 20-30 while I drive. But I do these things every day, so who cares? I care about the trends. I'm not a competitive walker. Sleep seems accurate as well and is excellent for trending. I can tell when I have a restless night and the fitbit is great for quantifying that. You cannot track sleep with the Apple watch. No idea if the calories burned are accurate for either product, but again, trends.The App: Winner- FitbitI think this where the fitbit completely shines as a fitness product. The app is so user friendly, so streamlined, and generally fun to play around with. I love watching my cardio fitness score change and keeping an eye on my resting heart rate overnight. Apple has a ton of 3rd party apps which are great, but it lacks the complete integration of the fitbit.Final thoughts:The reality is that these are completely different products used for completely different reasons. I haven't decided which one I will be keeping yet, but if I were basing my decision on fitness alone, at a non competitive level, I would choose the fitbit hands down. There are other useful features that make the Apple watch appealing in my line of work, so I'll have to weigh those into my decision.Overall, the fitbit makes fitness fun. It's packed with so many cool features, and really is a motivator for daily movement. It is perfect for someone who wants to streamline their fitness goals and keep track of their life. It is a wear all day and all night product.The apple watch doesn't have the same coolness factor with regard to fitness, and really doesn't motivate me to workout anymore than my iPhone would. It is perfect for someone who doesn't care about tracking fitness goals, but wants to leave their phone at home during a workout. The ability to stream music, track distance with a built in GPS, and respond to text messages are wonderful. This is a take off during the day and never wear at night product. I would use this primarily as a smart watch with the added bonus of being incredibly useful for running.If you do decide on the fitbit, be careful with sizing! I have a 7 inch wrist and the large band fits me on the last 2-4 holes (keep it loose when not working out). In other words, the band runs pretty large.For reference, the Apple watch is 38 mm in grey.Hopefully that helps!

  Ok, so at first I was really, REALLY hesitant about buying the Charge 2 because you never know what problems can arise with new, hot off the press tech. However, I've had wonderful experiences with Fitbit customer service in the past (as in ""Hey, my thing stopped working"" and they were all like ""Sorry about that, here's a new thing- no charge!""), so I feel confident that if anything does go awry, Fitbit will take care of their customers. So, I took the plunge and ordered it.It came today in the mail and I scurried off with it like Gollum and his ring...My precioussssssss!Oh where to begin! Let's see- well it came in lovely, easy to open packaging. Opening up the box felt like I was arousing my Charge 2 from his slumber in his comfy, plastic bed. I immediately noticed that the teal color was more vibrant than its predecessor, and the larger screen gave it an all around sleeker look. The band is now longer, so if the large size from the old Charge was a bit big for you- go for the small with the Charge 2; I have tiny wrists myself, and I'm two notches away from the last ring on the inside! EDIT: I just realized my review was placed under the large size...my Charge 2 is a small. But large or small, only the band is different in length, NOT the screen!The charger was completely redesigned; the days of not having your Charge, well, CHARGE due to it slipping out are dead and gone. The new, blissfully longer charger clips onto the Charge itself, and as long as you align the hole in the charger with the button on the side of the Charge, you're good to go (see picture for reference)! Just make sure you clip it from underneath, and not over the screen or else it won't charge...not that I uh, made a silly mistake like that or anything. *cough*Setup could not have been easier. The entire process from taking it out of the box to having it fully synced and functional was less than ten minutes. Whoa. I was setting it up using the app on my Android phone, and I was expecting that it would need to be charged first but nope! It sprung to life and was ready to go!  After it was all synced I checked the battery and saw it was at medium power- right out of the freaking box!Onto features...do you like lots of features? I like lots of features and the Charge 2 has ALL the flipping features you could possibly want.I feel like Fitbit has been personally keeping tabs on me and my current interests. I just recently got into breathing meditation and interval training, and when I heard that the Charge 2 was going to include both these features I was pretty much like, ""Shut up and take my money!""After playing with the Charge 2 for about 30 seconds, I came to realize that when you want to choose a feature, for example the breathing exercise, after pushing the button on the side to get to that function, you then hold the button for a second to choose to start it. With the breathing exercise, it allows you to choose between a 2 or 5 minute breathing session. It works by having you breath in rhythm with a ring that expands and contracts on the screen, and it shows your breathing in and out at the bottom with a continuous little graph (see picture to clarify if this sounds wonky to you.) If it comes across as confusing don't worry- Charge 2 guides you through it...it's much more talkative (err, textative?) than the old Charge, and I like it!So for once I was actually excited to hit the hall of pain- uh, I mean the gym, so I could test out my new buddy here. First thing I did was the elliptical; in the past I avoided it because my old charge wouldn't count it as steps. Now all you have to do is select the elliptical option from the workout menu on your charge 2, hold the button on the side and voila! Elliptical steps are now counted!Next I tried out the interval workout option! What's extra awesome about this feature is that it's customizable; the folks of Fitbit really outdid themselves with this one in my opinion. By going onto the app on my phone, I was able to set the intervals to one minute of workout, and two minutes of rest for a total of five sets. Then while I was on the treadmill, I went to the workout menu, chose interval training, and it started right away. Once the minute was up, Charge 2 gave me two little buzzes to let me know to switch to rest mode, and after two minutes gave me another two buzzes to pick it up again. The buzzes aren't very strong, but I still felt them just fine.Then I went onto strength training, and selected weights from the menu (this is all via the charge 2, not the app on the phone). Now the way I strength train is 3 sets of 12 reps, and then a minute of rest in-between. I'm honestly not sure if that minute of rest affects the readings or not, but my guess is no- that Charge 2 calculates everything based on pulse readings. And speaking of pulse readings, it feels like they've improved the technology in that department as well!FYI- I have pretty low blood pressure due to hypothyroidism, so the readings below may seem off, but they're accurate in my case. My resting heart rate is usually between 61 and 66 bpm (beats per minute)So that concluded my gym session. Upon looking at my readings later on, it was kind of neat to compare them. Now the weight training session showed that in 27 minutes I burned 99 calories and had 110 average of bpm. Now with the elliptical, I only did it for 10 minutes, burned 62 calories, and had a 130 average bpm going at a fast pace continuously. With the interval training on the treadmill (here's where it gets interesting folks) for 15 minutes I burned 122 calories with a 148 average bpm. Despite having two minute rest periods several times, I still burned more calories and had a higher heart rate than the continuous workout on the elliptical. Interval training all the way! Although...I wonder if you could do interval training on the elliptical and still have the steps count. I'll have to experiment with that... *EDIT* Yes you can in fact do interval training on the eliptical and have steps count!There's still so much to try! The connected GPS looks like a pretty neat feature, and it's a nice extra to include! I'm not much of a runner myself being bite sized, but you can still track location for other things like walking, biking and hiking. Then there's call, text, and calendar notifications (adding the calendar was a great idea). You can also change bands now, so if you wear out your current band (like I did with my old Charge- bubbling issues anyone?) or just want a different look, you can switch them whenever your little heart so desires. Oh! And there's lots of screen options that you can choose from like a dial watch,  extra bold print, and having time/date/steps/heart rate all together (which is what I ended up choosing)- and that's just to name a few!*EDIT* So they added a feature which shows your fitness level by going into the heart rate section of the app and then swiping left to get to that screen. I originally thought it was fitness test type thing, but I misunderstood. The app already calculates your fitness level for you based on several factors (resting heart rate, your bpm during exercises, and other information collected from your profile). So sorry for any confusion! No tests for you.Alas, there is but one problem I have encountered so far. I was walking while holding my phone in the hand that my charge 2 was on, and noticed that it didn't count my steps. So after experimenting for a bit (holding up my hands like I was pushing an invisible grocery cart, though it probably looked more like I was pretending to be A zombie) I came to the conclusion that if your hand is held up flat (palm up or palm down) in midair, like when holding a phone...the charge 2 doesn't register steps. However, it should be noted that when I put the charge 2 in workout mode, it DID count some of the steps, even when holding my phone, but it didn't seem to accurately count them all. I guess the solution is don't play on your phone while you walk? Or at least leave the hand with the Charge 2 on it by your side when playing Pokemon Go- you can play with one hand, right?Everything considered, this is truly an amazing piece of technology that is priced extremely fairly for all that it offers, including the best fitness app that is included at no extra charge. Thanks good guy Fitbit!In conclusion...This is the one fitness tracker...TO RULE THEM ALL!UPDATE: 9/20Yes yes, I know what you're all thinking- how could I possibly make this exceedingly long review even better? MAKE IT LONGER!Battery lasted from Wednesday afternoon (after fully charging it) to Monday night. It should be called Fitbit doesn't need to Charge all that often, amiright? Eh?Motivation Man! Every hour (just day hours, or you can customize which hours and days you want in the app) you don't move (or hardly move), Charge 2 gives you a friendly little buzz, and the animated little Motivation Man (as I like to call him) says something cute on the screen like ""Take me for a stroll?"" or ""97 more steps!"" (to reach 250). Do it. Don't let Motivation Man down.With the Fitness level tracker, my original score was placed in the good category and I was all happy that I was fitter than I thought. Well, the app suggests that if you want a more accurate reading, that you should go for a ten minute run outside with your Charge 2 synced to your phone for GPS tracking. So although I hate running more than kids who kick your seat continuously on a long flight, I did it. Upon looking at my fitness level thinking that my score was going to shoot up, it dropped down to fair, which is right after poor. Ouch. I mean in all fairness it's accurate but still...ouch. Went from feeling fitter to bitter.What's not accurate, however, is if you're at the gym and your Charge 2 syncs with your phone app for gps tracking. A few times while I was on the treadmill or elliptical, the GPS kicked in and gave me crazy readings. Now don' get me wrong- my step count wasn't affected in any way, the app just showed me a map of the wacky, non-existent trail that went though multiple buildings and over a river. You can just delete it of course, orrrrrr you could show it off to your friends and make stuff up...like I always teleport over rivers when I work out, doesn't everyone?The Fitbit app added a seriously impressive fitness game called Adventure challenge (it's in the challenges section) where your step count is shown on an actual map, like Yosemite Vernal falls to start off with, and the more you walk, the more you travel along the trail. Along the way you come across markers, and when you reach them, it shows you where you are on the trail with gorgeous panoramic pictures (hold up your phone, slowly turn left and right, and the picture pans out either way). There are also random ""gems"" on the map, and when you click them they either have a fun fact, a health multiple choice quiz, or a health challenge (like do tricep dips on a chair for a minute). You can collect them and earn a badge...or not-completely optional. However, I personally am having a blast with it, and I'm sort of stunned that they're including it in the app for free! It's like having an expensive dinner with Fitbit and when the check comes, Fitbit is all like, ""Hey, it's cool. I got this,""...you sure do Fitbit. You sure do.

So went on line and accidentally got a look alike, similar name and look but not fitbit. Did not realize it until I loaded the app, well decided to try it. I am a very active person but could not get 10,000 steps on it, thought oh well it's winter maybe I have been sitting too much.

  I wanted to upgrade my Fitbit device in the hopes that I would be able to add the pulse ox and Fitbit pay. I was surprised to see the box had both the lavender straps and black straps- great.  Fitbit pay was easy to set up but I was disappointed to find out that the SP02 sensor is on the device but turned off for me.  The community has different on/off news - very confusing.  The official company position is that it is turned on for some but off for most? with not news on when it will be released in 2020.  I sadly returned the device for a Garmin Vivosmart 4.

  The steps were never accurate.  You have to force syncing even though it's set to sync automatically.  O2 features were never made available.  The screen Wakes setting resets every time you charge the watch, which means when you move around in bed at night and haven't reset it to be off, the screen glows a bright light with movement.  They updated the Iphone software and changed the display which made it harder to view and no way to change it back. About a week ago the Calendar notifications started repeatedly sending notifcations causing the watch to vibrate every few minutes, even though no changes were being made to the calendar.  A few days later and, after only 18 months of use, the display now has white lines going through it.  Please note that I took really good care of this watch with no signs of wear.  Customer service was unable to help, said the watch was defective but since it was out of warranty they would only offer a small discount for a new watch.  It's apparent based on user groups, forums and customer suppoer that this is a known defect and Fitbit is well aware of it.  An apparently Charge 4 is no better.  Shame the company won't stand behind their product.

  Got this for a BD present.  I am not a tech pro, but, I do ok with apps, etc.  No instructions with this device.  I could never figure out how to operate the watch, itself.  I did not have many problems with the app on the phone.  But, it had different info than the watch itself.  The idea was not to have to carry my phone with me, when walking around.  I would swipe up and sideways, just per instructions, and per the ""Help"" email that I received.  But, I never go to where I wanted to go.  On first setup, sitting at my desk with fitbit in hand, it automatically recorded 524 calories.  I hadn't moved an inch!  This was such a headache that it ruined my birthday, actually.  Couldn't wait to send it back.  These things are made for the 20-30 somethings that grew up with stuff like this.  But, I can easily calculate how far I walk, and I know how much weight I lost by standing on a scale, or looking in mirror.  I don't need an appliance to tell me these things.  But, that's just me.  This was not something I found useful, at all.

  Honestly, I still prefer my Charge 2. That said, this one is growing on me. It is NOT user friendly, for the extra functions. I have to spin my arm towards me very suddenly, 3-4x, before it shows the screen. And the latch on the wristband is horrible, it has me ready to rip it off and throw across the room most days, and that's not my normal response. That said, it was my Christmas and I'm trying to learn to like it so I don't hurt my hubby's feelings!

  I changed to a Garmin watch in the same price range to get rid of the Fitbit hard plastic band that hurt to wear. Also, the HR accuracy on the charge 4 does not live up to the reputation of the charge 2 or 3. It constantly read my hr as double, no matter what steps I followed from support.  HR tracking was the main reason I bought it, so it was a big fail.

  I did not pay attention to the color but I love it and it works great. I have a little issue with the charging but it still charges and still works great.

  This is my 2nd Fitbit. The 1st one lasted about 6 years. I like the step counter and sleep features.  The ‚Äústairs‚Äù counter is questionable. It has recorded flights of stairs climbed during the night. It also records a flight of stairs when I get into my husband‚Äôs pickup truck. All in all I‚Äôm happy with this Fitbit but don‚Äôt fully trust the accuracy. For my purposes, it‚Äôs good.

  I was so excited for this Fitbit to be released. After using it for several day, I'm pretty bummed and will be returning it tomorrow. Here is my list of pros and cons:Pros:* GPS - This is the biggest reason for my excitement; finally a Versa with GPS!  I wanted a way to track my runs without taking my phone with me. (read cons for why I still can't go without my phone) The GPS lost signal during a portion of my run my run..... My phone still had good signal, so not sure why the Versa lost GPS signal. It wasn't for a long period of time (maybe a 0.10 of a mile?), but still disappointing.* SpO2 % - Pretty cool that it can track this....but it only gives a range from when you are sleeping. No way to spot check this. Cannot figure out why they didn't make this possible.* The flat back - the Versa line is the only fitness/smartwatch I have been able to tolerate. I despise the raised round backs of so many others. The back of this watch causes no discomfort.Cons:* No music storage - wth Fitbit?!?! So you added GPS, but took away music storage. Major design flaw. It can only stream music when connected to a phone via Bluetooth, so I *still* must take my phone on runs with me. This is the reason I am returning the watch.  ***EDIT*** - So....you can store music for offline use *ONLY* if you subscribe to Deezer or Pandora. So, It will cost at $10/month to store music. Spotify will only allow to to control the music from the watch, but doesn't allow for offline music. You can't upload your own music to the watch.* SpO2% - like I mentioned above, there is no way to spot check this. I would love to see what happens with my SpO2 during runs, when I go up to higher altitude and workout, etc. But, nope, it only tells me about the values from when I was asleep. *eyeroll*I am going to try the new Garmin Venu Sq Music Edition and hope the back of it is not as uncomfortable as I have experienced with other similar watches. It is about $20 more but can do all the things that the Versa 3 can do PLUS the things the Versa 3 can't. Onboard music storage, and spot checking SpO2. I'll miss the Fitbit communities and my familiarity with the Fitbit platform.

  I was not thrilled with this Fitbit Versa 3 after using it for a few of days. The screen kept freezing when I'd try to swipe, I couldn't get any music on it because you have to have a paid subscription to Pandora or Deezer, you can't run a timer while using the running app, it won't run my google calendar, and since I am an iPhone user, it doesn't allow me to respond to calls/texts (which I knew beforehand). But I thought, no biggie, Fitbit has a 45 day satisfaction guarantee. I called to initiate the return process and they told me that they would not honor it because I didn't purchase from Fitbit.com. Never mind that this is the Fitbit 'store' on Amazon and never mind that when I originally tried to purchase it through fitbit.com, the order wouldn't process because of a glitch on their end. Bye-bye fitbit, hello Apple watch.

  Update: So after several months of use I have two huge issues. One, the battery life seems to be dwindling. I am only seeing about 4 days as opposed to close to a week. Not the end of the world but worth mentioning. In addition, the charger connectss but I am have to disconnect and reconnect several times in order for it to charge. There has been at least 2 times where it wouldn't and I threw it in a drawer and gave up. Second, the stupid proprietary band keep failing. I have gone through at least 1 set every 2-3 weeks because the weird connecter fails and the band no longer works. It seems Fitbit is still almost a good watch after my ionic and versa experience. Hopefully the Google acquisition will correct the remaining issues...Background:I had the Ionic for about 2 years and we all know how that went. When it worked it was great but it had its flaws. My first Ionic lasted about 5 mons. and Fitbit sent me a replacement that lasted another 18mons. That Ionic died at the end of July 2020. So I made a big upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 which with tax set me back almost $500. After a month I absolutely hated it and was sick that I spent so much. I couldn't get more than a day of battery life, it was uncomfortable and honestly I just don't see what extra value it adds over a Fitbit type smart watch. What was worse was after 1 month the watch was marked down about $75 and the resale value was only around $275. So I lost my shirt on that watch....Review:So after dumping the GW3, I opted for the Versa 3 over the Sense as I don't think the extra sensor is worth the premium for my use case. Still has built in GPS which is great and everything I know and love from fitbit. In spite of all the negative reviews for this watch I think it is amazing. The display is bright and smooth, its comfortable, and there may be a tiny lag in the OS but its a FITBIT so honestly, it isn't like it freezes constantly it is just a small infrequent hiccup. Which my $500 GS3 did as well. Most important, I dont need to keep a charger with me at all times as I can get a solid 5 days off of a charge +/- depending on GPS use etc. So for those fitbit lovers who want to upgrade or for those who want a reasonable smart watch or fitness tracker this is for you. Is it a GS3 or Apple watch, No. But IMO, it isn't trying to be something its not. You don't need a bunch of Apps of games on your watch. That is what your $1000 phone is for. A watch is a tool to complement your phone. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy it.

  Ok so I promised myself I would test out the Fitbit against the several negative comments and come back and leave a review. All but ONE of the negative comments prove true. Let me start with the negative comments that proved untrue and why:Myth 1: this Fitbit doesn‚Äôt record accurate heart data, especially when working out. TRUTH: Yes it does record extremely accurately, including during workouts but you have to read the instructions!! When you workout the instructions say to tighten the strap one hole tighter than you usually wear it. Then you move the Fitbit 1-2 finger widths up from where your wrist meets your hand. After doing this I checked the Fitbit heart rate against my polar heart monitor every 5 minutes during a 45 min kickboxing workout. It was EXACTLY in tune with the polar heart rate monitor, always right on or within 5 BPM. The people who say otherwise are not following instructions or giving it a chance to figure out the best wrist placement.Myth 2: The light against your skin keeps you up at night/you can see the light as you try to sleep. TRUTH: No, you cannot see the blinking light that is against your skin. If you can then your band is way too lose. I wear it every night and never see the light blinking. I don‚Äôt even remember I‚Äôm wearing it!Myth 3: it scratches easily. TRUTH: I‚Äôve banged mine up pretty bad and to my surprise not a scratch in sight!Okay now for the negative comment that I discovered was true: It does not track steps when you are pushing a grocery cart or stroller. Sadly, this is true. Very frustrating when you have a child and you push them around the zoo all day in a stroller to later discover your steps barely moved. I solve this by letting my husband push the cart/stroller when possible. :) But this is the biggest negative for me about this Fitbit. I just learn to let the number on the screen go on those days when I have no one to push the cart and know that day I had a lot more steps than recorded.Things I love:1. The constant HR monitoring where you can see your heart health over time improve or get worse (in the Fitbit app)2. The sleep monitoring - this has been so eye opening! I can‚Äôt wait to check the app in the morning to see how much deep sleep I had the night before. I now know based on my results how I‚Äôm probably going to feel that day.3. Getting texts and calls!! It buzzes when you get a text or call and will scroll the message across the screen or show you who is calling. LOVE this feature.4. Stays charged for a long time.5. LOVE that it shows you total calorie burn for the day. Like the calories your body burns just by sleeping or sitting to workouts. This was the biggest reason I got this Fitbit (besides the constant HR monitoring) so I could make sure I was truly burning the calories I thought I was burning to aid in weight loss. That helped me to I know exactly how many calories to cut to lose weight.Things I wish I could change/do but in no way a deal breaker:1. Rearrange which stat I see first when I tap my watch.2. Be able to set it so that I can constantly see my HR when I‚Äôm working out. It gets old tapping it several times while I‚Äôm working out to find my HR.3. I don‚Äôt trust the calorie burn calculator. It seems really low. After a kickboxing workout where my polar monitor says I burned 300 calories, the Fitbit only recorded 130 calories. I‚Äôll keep looking into this and see if I can get something figured out. Thankfully you can add your workout in MyFitnessPal and it will sync up to the Fitbit app, including the calories you burned.4. Would be cool to have an option to add optional stats when you click through on your wrist, such as the weather.I recommend this Fitbit if you are looking to track constant HR, sleep, total calorie burn, and get alerted to texts and calls. I have learned so much about myself and my health.

  Item arrived not NEW. I didn't like the product itself, I should have read more comment about it before buying. It's hard to use, and I realized I better by smartwatch.What I don't like: - it's vibrates only ones when phone is ringing and vibration is too subtle, so I will probably miss the call if my phone is in backpack or somewhere in the pocket where I don't feel it. That is why I want to feel vibration on my hand as other smartwatches do. - tapping constantly (and hard enough) on display is nightmare, it's not usable for me or my wife. - icons are too small on display - twisting wrist constantly is hard - display is constantly goes off. it's like 8 bit display, why can't you make it show time all the time, I need to know time when I need it, w/o twisting my arm like crazy. - it doesn't count steps correctly. I really don't know how it counts, but it counts something different. - when I bought this wristband, there was already someone's steps counted, so we couldn't remove them, this is bad!Update: now I got calls from fitbit(or seller I don't really know) related companies ask me to remove that review, as it hurts their business. Guys, I don't agree with you. If product is bad for me I have a right to express it, so you can make next one better and not fool customers.

  My Fitbit Alta HR has been super buggy over the last couple of months (screen goes dead midday despite full battery) and I followed all the troubleshooting advice (which usually consisted of a ""reset"").  It helped for awhile, but this week the HR monitor stopped working altogether.  This is the SECOND Fitbit that I have owned that mysteriously stopped working around a year after purchase (I had the Charge previously that literally started falling apart after a year).  When I contacted Customer Service, their ""canned"" response was that my device was beyond the one year warranty window (by two months, FYI), and the best they could do was offer a 25% discount on my next Fitbit...end of story.  I have now had two failed products from this company...that's a ridiculous track record and abysmal customer service...why on earth would I buy another?!?  There are WAY too many fitness trackers on the market these days at WAY more reasonable prices to treat customers this way.

  This is such a disappointment,  use interface is terrible in their app.  Everything is so convoluted and confusing,  seems like there is multiple areas for the same functions.  Doesn't synch if your location is turned off,  or registered steps when signing(if you are deaf or talking to deaf folks. ), and when you drive and turn your steering wheel.  My whole family uses fitbit,  so I am keeping it.  But for the price of this watch, it's trash... can't make phone calls, can't initiate texts(if you can figure out how to make that work to even view them....) the paid version let's you use like five little trails.. it doesn't clarify what period the step count is from for competitions.... the only watch covers are cheap slip- on covers(that slip off easily and expose the watch(if you buy it,  purchase the warranty lol)  As I said,  I am keeping mine... However,  I bought the one I got 3 years ago for half the price, and am very satisfied with it,  I just carry this one in my pocket(sometimes, when I  remember it lol).

  Button is hard to press. Time is off by hours  when screen activated  then corrects itself after about 5 seconds. In always on mode the military time is wrong. 2100 shows as 0900. Sometimes shows as 2900.

  I used to be a FitBit fan, but I will NEVER be purchasing any of their products again.I bought a FitBit, and it worked great. However, they rolled out a software update and my watch stopped syncing. Instead, a big giant X showed up on my watch saying ""Data not cleared"".I tried multiple options to fix it, spent HOURS trying to update it, and got nowhere.When I Googled the issue,  I realized many other consumers had the same issue.I spoke to the customer support, we did a bit of troubleshooting, and got nowhere. I was told they would look into options for me. A couple of minutes after the chat, I got an email saying they were sorry that my device wasn't working, and since it is outside the warranty period of 1 year, they have no legal obligations to do anything. I was instead directed to buy a new FitBit.HERE'S THE ISSUE...It wasn't anything on my end that caused this to be defective; no physical damage, no careless handling of the watch. Instead, a software bug on THEIR side caused the watch to not be syncing, and instead of apologizing and taking responsibility or offering solutions, they are falling back onto a standard ""sorry, we can't do anything outside the warranty.""COMPLETE waste of money. I now have a very expensive paperweight, which was damaged thanks to their updates. I will never be buying a FitBit product again because I wouldn't trust them to not damage future devices, and certainly don't trust them to take responsibility.Before you buy this, check their reviews on TrustPilot and you'll see TONS of customers like myself who used to be fans, but who have been ripped off.

  I used to be a Fitbit fan.  But there customer service is horrible. My Versa 3 all the sudden says I have been doing about 50-60 floors a day.  I live in Florida where its flat and in a one story house.  I shouldn't have any. I talked with three agents before I had them admit there was an ongoing problem with the Versa 3 counting way to many floors.  But they will not do anything but tell me how to manually take out the floors.  Which you cant even do that.  You have to say what time you think you have wrong the floors and say you were driving.  So you loose your steps and everything else. I bought something to track this and keep my calories somewhat accurate and this is useless for that.Very upset with Fitbit and going back to my Samsung Watch

  I previously owned a Garmin Forerunner, but it had some charging issues and I had heard great things about sleep tracking for Fitbits so I thought I'd give a Fitbit a try. I went with the Versa 3 because I am a runner and wanted the built in GPS to track my runs.First let's talk sleep. This was the reason I bought the watch and I am super disappointed to find out that the Versa thinks I'm sleeping when I'm not. Basically, if you are lying awake, but your heart rate and breathing are slow (which they tend to be if you were sleeping and then wake up), it thinks you are asleep. So I can lie in bed awake for hours but the Versa says I got 8 hours of sleep.Running is a disappointment too. There is no quick button to pause your time (if you are at a stoplight, crosswalk, etc) and so you have to get the display on and then try to swipe down to get the right screen and push pause with your sweaty hands (which doesn't always work).Also, there is no interval tracker like the Garmin. You can set the Garmin to run any interval you want, and the default interval is 1 mile. So every 1 mile (or whatever interval you have set, and you can also set in km), it lights up so you can see it, beeps to let you know to look, and shows your mile pace, whole distance, whole time, etc. Really helpful!!! There is no way to do this on the Fitbit. You have to swipe through multiple screens (again with the sweaty fingers) and its very small type to try to see your details.Wish I had bought another Garmin. It may be okay if you're not a runner, but as a runner, this is NOT the smart watch to get.

  Is Fitbit Blaze still useful when many watch makers and smart watches are being pushed to the market daily? Lets find outI was a fitbit user before this, I owned the first gen Fitbit Charge HR. My wife and I both owned one. It was good, it does what it advertised till it broke down a few weeks back. I then start to look around for a replacement. What I needed were,1. A 24/7 heart monitoring2. A battery life of minimum 3 days3. Sleep tracking4. A screen5. Steps tracking6. Distance tracking7. Stop watch8. Not bulky9. Minimum rain and splash proofAdditional feature that will affect my decision1. Water resistant, so I can take it for a swim or shower2. GPS module included so I do not need to carry my phone when I jog3. Music ControlI started to look around, and ended with Garmin Vivo Smart series and Fitbit Charge HR 2, they both met what I wanted, and Garmin actually have the additional features that I would like to have. I almost go for Garmin, until I started to look into Fitbit Family of activity tracker. I found out fitbit surge will fit the criteria too, albeit with a mono display screen, which made it feels a bit of outdated.Long story short, I then chose Fitbit Blaze in the end and after receiving it and using it for 3 months now, I am going to pen down my thoughts on it.Fitbit Blaze is a squarish module tracker which is removable from the strap itself, allowing you to get creative with your watch strap. There are lots of alternative watch strap that you can purchase to suit different events that you will be attending.Build Quality (9/10)Default watch strap is made of silicon with diagonal texture strip. I like it because it does not get uncomfortable when I wear it for my basketball games and jogging session. It does not irritate my skin but for some, it might. The square module itself seems to be constructed nicely. It is a square and nothing more. Button are accessible and you will get the hang of it without reading the manual.Screen (8/10)No fancy technology on the screen used. From the specs it looks like a low quality screen, I will not disagree, the pixel that made up the digits can be easily seen when watch is put closer to the eyes. However on daily occasions, the distance from the glance we made to view the time, is far enough, and the screen do look bright and clear enough.There are four modes to the screen adjustment ‚Äì Dim, Normal, Max, Auto.I used only Dim, in order to maximise the battery. It is hard to see under direct sunlight under the DIM mode. If needed you can always set it to AUTO. On daily usage indoor and most outdoor situation, I find the DIM mode sufficient.Touch screen is responsive, and there is nothing for me to complain about.Customer Service (10/10)They are top notch, upon receiving my Fitbit Blaze, I only realised a small dent at the bottom of my watch and I contacted the Fitbit Support Team. After a couple of emails, they actually offered to send a replacement to me. It only takes 2 days for them to make the decision, and about 1 week for the replacement to reach me. I am happy, that they took attention to my enquiry and acted on it.I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to make a decision so fast. They were above my expectations.Battery Life (9.5/10)Normal smart watches last about 24 hours. Even the latest fossil Q is no diff. Some tracker last 3 days while others which utilises changable battery last for months.Newer tech with kinetic energy will have a infinite battery life. For Fitbit Blaze, it last me usually for 4 to 5 days. This is inline with what they advertised and what I have expected.My bluetooth is on to PAIR mode 24/7, you can choose to off it if you want. And I am on DIM mode for brightness of my screen.It got a score of 9.5 because in comparison with garmin and apple watch, it triumphs over them. I am satisfied with the battery life.But of course, if they eventually adopts the kinetic energy tech, it will definitely be 10.Features (8.5/10)Fitbit Blaze is one that function like a smart watch and activity tracker. The features include- Smartphone notifications. You can choose what kind of notifications to receive via the Fitbit App- Music control via Bluetooth, however it does not work when your music playing device is connected to another device via Bluetooth. For example I connected my phone to my Bluetooth headphone to listen to my music. Fitbit Blaze will not be able to use the music control function, even though it is connected to my phone as well. However notification still comes in.- VO2 matrix- Breathing under the Relax Mode- Linked with Fitstar for different exercises- Exercise mode which can help you track different kind of exercises you are doing- Sleep tracking which will separate sleep stages into ‚Äì Awake, REM, Light and Deep Sleep. There are also benchmark and 30 days average for you to compare the quality of your sleep- 3rd party app which can be connected to inject ‚ÄúFun‚Äù into your watch. App like Wokamon, a virtual pet app, which will take the steps taken and convert it to experience for you to level up your own pet that you are raising in the app.This section did not get a higher rating because of the loss of music control function when my music playing device has got another Bluetooth device connected to it. I also look forward to a GPS module included and a waterproof rating so I can safely take it to swim.App (9/10)Apart from the need of switching on my GPS on my phone, the rest is good. The interface is easy to use, and it is easy to change the settings around. You can arrange the positions of the stats that you want to see in the Fitbit App. You can connect with your friends and with all the badges, it can act as an extra motivation to keep you going.Final wordsWhat I would like to see is probably an integrated mic, so I can do voice note to my phone and reply voice messages, however I do understand that it will then move the tracker towards a smart watch. I do think fitbit can excel well in that field too!Well, thankfully, I guess I made the right choice. Albeit some features I wanted like GPS module and water resistant aren‚Äôt there, it still make a good day to day tracker and a semi smart watch. I can change the strap anytime I want. For sports and for work. I am happy with their customer service even though some will disagree.I will never know if the heart rate monitor is the most accurate, but I do know at this current moment, nothing can be 100% precise, so I use it to see abnormal heart rate activity in me which is useful. If you are a previous fitbit user, this will make a nice upgrade. The app is as good as before too. With the price tag, the value is hard to beat.I do think that this is meant for people with moderate exercise activity and is not meant for hard core trainers. It is meant to monitor your well-being and encourage a more active lifestyle, it is versatile in its outlook and enough features to make it a semi smart watch. So why not?I am a regular Amazon Prime Shopper and Reviewer, if my review helped you in making a decision, please mark the ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù button. It tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this! Thanks!

  I can't say enough good things about this fitness watch. This is going to be an in depth review so I apologize in advance for the length.First... THIS IS NOT MEANT TO ACT LIKE THE APPLE WATCH! I feel like a lot of people think, ""Well, for $50 more, I can get a refurb apple watch or an apple watch on sale at Best Buy."" Having both watches, I can at least help with some differences between the two. If your goal is fitness tracking, this is for you. If your goal is organization with some fitness benefits, this watch is not for you.To simplify the product description, here is what it does. It continually tracks your heart rate, your steps, stairs climbed, calories burned, active minutes, miles, exercise, and sleep. It seamlessly works with the FitBit app, which can also help you keep track of your calories consumed (works with apps like MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, etc), water intake, and weight. You can also set a goal in the app that allows you to set how many hours of the day you want to take 250+ steps each hour, however it does NOT remind you to move to ensure your success with this (See10/19/16 update on cons section). You can also set notifications to come through from your phone to your watch, such as text messages, phone calls, calendar reminders, and control your iPod, iPhone, etc music from it. As of this review, photos and emoji's do not come through on the watch. As of this review, this watch has 4 different face options, the ability to set it to your dominant or non dominant wrist, silent alarms, all day sync with your phone, etc. It also has FitStar workouts built into it.Pros:-Continuous heart rate monitoring.-Easy to see in daylight (nice bright screen). Has the ability to turn ""auto"" light/dim based on sensing your lighting conditions.-Face turns on when it senses you've turned your wrist to view it. It is mostly accurate.-Charges quickly.-Charge lasts, realistically, more like 3-4 days, but if you don't have notifications on, I'm sure it could last for 5.-Sleek design looks like a nice watch. Many people have said, ""So how do you like your Apple Watch?"" and then I have to tell them it's not an Apple Watch. I do think that this watch is continually compared to the apple watch, however.Cons:-The band is somewhat uncomfortable, especially to sleep in. The buckle digs into my wrist on the side. I would like to see someone come up with a buckleless, soft silicone band like the apple watch.UPDATE: 11/26/16: I've had several companies reach out to me and send me bands to try. All of them have been the Milanese style bands and the ones that came from china caused major hives/break outs on my wrist, one of which required a prescription cream to resolve. I have no idea what they're using in their metals because I generally don't have problems with metals. One milanese band has worked consistently well for me without skin issues and no problems with the magnet slipping. It was one I purchased for around $30 on amazon. So be wary of that.Also, they finally started making silicone. Ands that do not have a buckle that are similar to the Apple Watch band. I ordered one and received it in the mail today. So far so good. It's much more comfortable than any other band I've tried. Please note this is NOT an affiliate link and none of the things in the post are sponsored.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01J0RAP3U/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1-As of the date of this review, the watch does NOT have ""reminder to move"" functionality. I feel like this is a basic essential to most fitness bands. Doing some reading, it looks like FitBit plans to have a firmware update in the future to include this, but as of now, it does not.UPDATE: 10/19/2016: Fitbit recently released an update to the Blaze with ""reminder to move"" however, I find it lacking. Essentially, it reminds you to move 10 minutes before the hour if you haven't gotten 250 steps in in the hours you have set to move 250 steps or more. What I would like to see is a reminder to move during hours that you set based on the amount of steps you want to achieve in a day. So if you want 10k steps between the hours of 6am and 8pm, let it remind you at a time you set (10 minutes or 15 minutes before the hour) if you haven't done 714 steps each hour in order to make it to that goal. I would also like to see something that reminds you to move if you've been ""sedentary"" for more than xx minutes. I had a fitness tracker several years ago that would buzz if you had been sedentary for 10 minutes. I liked that because it kept me active. This functionality would be great for people with office jobs that sit all day. It's nice to see Fitbit working at the solution of having reminders to move, but I don't think it's there yet.-The charger is somewhat annoying. FitBit has a proprietary charger so you can't just use any standard cord to plug it in. You have to take the face of the watch out of the band and put it in a boxed-frame like charger to charge. Given that the Apple Watch has a magnetic charger, I would have hoped to see something similar.This watch DOES NOT have an app store, it does not store music, you cannot respond to text messages, do facetime, send photos, etc from it. You cannot control your phone's camera from it. This watch is made for fitness and has basic smart watch functionalities, however it is made to be a fitness watch, not a smart watch.I have worked out with this on one wrist and my polar heart rate monitor watch (with chest strap) on the other wrist and got pretty much identical results.****YOU HAVE TO WEAR THIS WATCH JUST ABOVE YOUR WRIST BONE OR YOUR READINGS WILL NOT BE ACCURATE**** If you don't like wearing a watch on that area of your wrist, this may not be for you. I like loose fitting watches, so this was an adjustment for me.The face *could* scratch easily, I think. I haven't had a problem with it, but I did have a couple of glass screen protectors on it and they both broke within a day, but my watch face is still fine without scratches.I hope this review helps. I don't think I missed anything, but if I did, I will updated it in the future.

  This rating was 4 stars until about a month ago. Until then I really liked my Blaze. I wiper it everyday at work and home. I had bought the different bands for different occasions. My only complaints were a lack of more choices on screen display options or configurations and colors. Also, it gets annoying doing the wrist flip repeatedly to get the thing to show you the time. My Timex had never failed me there, even after 5 years.Anyways, I was still a loyal Fitbit Blazer and bragged it up at work and smack talked all the Apple watch people about how great the Blaze was over the Apple.  I sold more than a couple of new co-workers in the Fitbit that way.But, now my Blaze just twitches all day and night. It turns on for moments then reboots and vibrates as if stuck in some Russian hack induced paralysis.  Customer Service said too bad, so sad. Since I bought it in Feb 2016 they will give me a discount coupon to buy a new one but the warrant only covers a year. Are you kidding me??? But another one??? That's like lighting $200 on fire but getting to watching it burn for 14 months! No way! Maybe Timex will make a new watch I'll enjoy for $40 and at least 5 years...

  I LOVE this band! I had the Fitbit One (clip) for 3 years....its been washed, went swimming, left in dressing rooms, you name it. I'm honestly surprised I didn't lose it sooner. While I loved the simplicity of the One, when I finally lost it the Flex 2 is the same price so I figured I'd try to make the switch.....I was nervous about a wrist tracker from stories about grossly inaccurate step counts. I have a very small wrist and found this to be thinner on my wrist than my Michael Kors watch. It is extremely lightweight, and simple. If you are ""gadgety"" and want more of a watch function, this won't be it for you. All it does is with 2 quick taps shows your progress on the buttons during the day. It will vibrate with calls and texts, and can remind you to move your 250 steps an hour. It has done a good job with sleep tracking, and I must say is pretty accurate with the step count.Pros:Extremely lightweight, not bulky and the lavender is a gorgeous color.Easy to snap on, and can be worn loose or snug.Water proof-I don't wear it in the shower but put it on right after and don't have to worry about unclipping like my old one when I switch from Pj's to work pants, to workout gear, etc.....Put it on and forget about it (unlike the dressing room I had to go back to 2 hours later after trying on clothes once).Vibrates with texts/calls/reminds you to move every hourEasy syncing/tracking on phone-you can't see anything from the band so you have to sync periodically throughout the day from the app. I have my phone all the time so that's not a big deal for me.Removable tracker pops out easily and can be used in other accessories.Cons:No watch/HR/caller ID functionNo stair climber function-for some reason I really liked that with the One. Kinda bummed.Overall I would say this is an excellent product. Since I have a watch and am not a hardcore workout person, I don't need the extra bells and whistles of other Fitbit models. It does the job, and is holding up nicely. Would recommend.

  Upgraded to this from a Fitbit Charge. I loved the charge but after a year, the battery wouldn't hold a charge and the band literally fell apart. This wasn't the fault of the Fitbit; I work in a cafe so I'm constantly washing either dishes or my hands. Even being careful it got wet a lot, and I suppose even water resistance has its limits.The difference between water resistant and water proof is why I went with the Flex 2, as opposed to just getting another charge  So far it's held up beautifully, I do try to remember to take it off at the end of my shifts and wipe it down, just to be sure.As for actual functionality, I'd say it compares well to my charge. I like the minimalism of the display, and the clasp on this band is MUCH better than on the charge, which popped off my wrist more than once.I especially like the various alerts, including the reminder to get up and move. It's motivated me to take laps around my kitchen island to get my steps a couple times. No shame! And as someone who regularly gets up before 5am, the silent alarm is wonderful. It wakes me up easily without waking my husband. That's a huge bonus in my book.Overall, this seems to be fairly accurate in terms of step count, although I'm not as dogmatic about that as some people. I just want to know that I am moving throughout the day, and that I have some accountability to myself when it comes to reaching my goals. The only thing I wish is that I could set the auto-detect for active minutes a little lower. My walk to work takes about 7 minutes, and if I forget to turn on exercise tracking, it doesn't always get counted. That's honestly my only gripe and it's a small one.This is a great tracker, it works well, charges quickly, and once it's on my wrist I forget it's there. It's been a great help in striving for my fitness goals.

  I have had a Fitbit since they were first invented, and recently my Fitbit One was lost at the beach, so I was forced to buy a new model since the One is obsolete.  I found that the Flex 2 is the closest I could come; I wear the tracker clipped to my bra, and it is the only Fitbit that isn't built into a wristband.  After two weeks of use it's safe to say this is a real step down from the old model.Cons:-There is no alphanumeric display.  The One would show you your steps, miles, hours slept while in progress, etc.  Instead you have to tap it to see your progress in lights; 1 of 4 lights means 25% of your goal, etc.  Useless-The battery discharges much faster than the One, and takes much longer to charge, so it's more inconvenient to find the charger, charge it, and remember to come back two hours later.-The Flex 2 comes only with 2 wristbands.  There is no option to buy it in another configuration (like a pendant or a clip) so anyone who rejects the wristband is forced to buy a 3rd party holder.-The bluetooth or something else keeps it from easily synchronizing with any Android phone (had no problems with the One), so I am forced to synch with my computer most of the time.-The sleep function is a complete joke.  The One required you to tell it when you were going to sleep, and when you got up, which makes a lot more sense.  The Flex 2 thinks I went without sleep for the last week, even though I was wearing it on my wrist at night as required.  Apparently I didn't stay still long enough for it to think I ever fell asleep.  Brilliant design. Fitbit's answer?  Log sleep manually.  Gee thanks.-The Flex 2 doesn't measure stairs, so my old goal from the One of climbing at least 10 flights a day it out the window.  Bummer.Pros:-The tracker itself is small, so it's easier to clip to clothing if you have a good clip.

  Amazon shows me that I bought my Zip on Nov. 14, 2014. We were faithfully attached for almost four years exactly before, last week, I accidentally ran him through the washer and dryer. I've been despondent ever since. He was possessed of neither bells nor whistles. He tracked steps and calories burned and not much else. He wasn't fancy; I always kept a store of CR-2025 batteries for when he grew weak. And yet he far outlasted my family members' much more expensive Fitbit One and Charge 2. He was small and nondescript; I could clip him on my pants and my wrist was free to wear a more aesthetically pleasing watch. Had I not been so careless, I don't doubt he could've lasted another four years.The only downside: I'm pretty sure I only paid around $50 in 2014. And this now very old model is currently almost $80. Still, he's worth it. Come soon, payday, and reunite us.

  Love this little guy. Nice and small. I personally just carry it in my pocket. Seems to be pretty accurate in the amount of steps.  Works well with the fit bit app where you can keep track of your steps, distance, food intake, weight and more. Hold competitions with other friends that have a Fitbit as well. Great motivation to get your steps in,  Fun little unit and I love the size. It does not do some of the things that the watches or other bigger units do such as stair count, But honestly that's fine with me. Would buy again![...]

  I had a fitbit one for years. Loved it.  But sadly it died. (Owners fault. I washed it). I got the Zip and was a little sad by the shape. My fitbit one I tucked in my bra. This does not do that as well.  But I could overlook that. The zip was fine, for about two weeks. Then the battery died.  Just a fluke I assumed.  I replaced the battery.  Three weeks later the battery died.  Replaced again.  This new one lasted two weeks. *sigh*I called the fitbit people and they were nice. I sent them my zip and they sent me a new one. Huzzah! Mission accomplished.  Except... two weeks into the new fitbit... battery died. AGAIN.  So the product works fine, except every three weeks I need to buy a new battery.  I still have the item, but am rather annoyed. I want my one back.I think fitbit is trying to faze out the clip pedometers and go to just the wrist bands. Alas.

  The trick to using this device is to CLOSE the app when you're not syncing. I only sync three to four times a day, then I promptly CLOSE the app. Additionally, ONLY use the app on ONE device.  (i.e. NOT both your phone and tablet) Doing both of those things, made the battery last for months. Unfortunately, there are NO instructions that come with the device, so you have to figure these things out on your own. That would be my only complaint.For me, this activity tracker works great.

  Have had this for 4 years now. Received a replacement which I lost and now all Fitbit says is ""we sent you a replacement, pound sand."" The battery lasts a handful of days. I bought a new one last week. The one I got in 2016 was $49, the one I got last week (also from Amazon) was $179.00. I'm pretty sure the cost of living hasn't got up nearly 400% but the price of a Fitbit Zip has.I was hoping for improvement when Google bought it but no such luck.

  This has been the single most frustrating fitness tracker experience that I have ever had. Connecting the device to smart phones (OnePlus 6T. Galaxy S8, Galaxy S9) and computers (via the included USB dongle) is a breeze and works the first time on every device. Syncing after that first connection works every time, as well. After that, it's a crap-shoot as to whether the thing will sync to anything. I bought TWO of these pieces of garbage and haven't been able to get either to sync to ANY of my six devices in over 24 hours. I tried removing and repairing and none of my devices (in two separate locations) can even find either of these things now.The Play Store reviews are chock full of people experiencing the same problem. This is just a sub-par product.I did manage to do one successful sync with a hammer before tossing the one that's at my current location into the garbage (as the photo shows). I'll do the same to the other tomorrow.

  I was provided Fitbit Surge from REI at no cost to test 6 months ago. Here are my thoughts after 6 months of use:I have been using it every day along with the Fitbit app on my iPhone 6 and the Fitbit Dashboard on my Macbook Pro. Here are my observations:‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëPRO'S‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ùñ The app on my iPhone allows me to easily enter the type of food I am eating and the amount of calories, and calories from fat. The app is synched up with a HUGE database and allows you to scan a barcode on a package and it automatically shows you the pertinent nutritional information. I have used this feature on about 40 items so far, and about 70-80% of these items were in the database. The others I added manually, but then you can pull the up easily the next time you eat that food item. You can also type in the name of a restaurant and it will pull up items on their menu. It has worked on 100% of the these with 95% of the items listed.‚ùñ Setting my weight loss and gain goal is wonderful! It asks your current weight, your target weight and how long you want to take to get there (It shows you the date you should achieve your target weight in 3-4 categories ranging from Easy to Difficult). I have lost  5lbs in the last 6 days. I have been rather ambitious! Other goals can be set and tracked!‚ùñ It's a great motivator to get in shape. If you're the type of person that likes to track data and finds that seeing your progress helps you to get going, then this is a GREAT product. This tracker has greatly enhanced my motivation by allowing me to see my progress in multiple areas. The app and dashboard not only show you your workouts (so you can compare and see your progress), but they also allow your to track your calories in and calories out. You can also record your water intake. These elements have been literally life-changing for me.‚ùñ The dashboard gives you badges and motivational ""splashes"". Fitbit also will send you a weekly email showing your weekly stats and progress ""at a glance"". All very helpful and encouraging.‚ùñ The tracker itself is VERY comfortable. The sleep tracking has been helpful in showing how many times I am ""restless"" during the night.‚ùñ The tracker charges very quickly. I have docked it while taking a shower with half battery life and after my shower (10-15 mins) it looks fully charged. I have had no issues with better life whatsoever, and considering all that it does - the battery last longer then I would expect.‚ùñ The workout variety is great and it allows you to customize your workouts, so the tracking possibilities are endless. The dashboard gives you very detailed information on multiple areas including (for a walk): Elevation, Pace, Heart Rate, Heart Rate Zones, Calorie Burn and Impact on Your day. The GPS works flawlessly, and as long as I'm outside, does not take long at all to hook up (5-10 secs). I have used the Exercise area for: Running and Weight Lifting‚ùñ The face of the tracker is very nice, the displays are less then ""dazzling"", but I realize this is probably part of the reason for the long battery life. I don't mind not having the ""glitzy"" face of the MS product. This is much more effective from what I have read. The build of the device is strong and I expect it to last a long time. No issues with inadvertently swiping the face, it does so easily but not often accidentally. The back light works really well. I have left mine set to ""auto"" and it seems to come on just at the right time.‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëCON'S‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ùñ The HR Monitor does drop during high intensity workouts. I usually start my workouts with cardio so if I am on an elliptical it works just fine. I literally can grab the HR monitor on the gym elliptical and watch my Surge and they almost always change simultaneously! I would say that 90% of the time they are matching perfectly or 1 beat off. That's pretty amazing! So, after my cardio I move quickly to weight training on ""selecterized"" equipment. This is where the HR tracking can go haywire. Because of the rapid arm movements, and possibly the level of sweat that is being generated - the tracker can go from 130 BPM to 98 BPM in a second. Now, I know that my HR is not doing that. I tried all the suggested fixes: sliding up my arm further, making sure it was loose enough, tight enough, etc. and nothing seemed to work. I even called fitbit. They recommended I try it on my other arm. I did, really no difference. In this area, it just seems like the technology has limits. They also have their limitations and if the area that reads becomes dry - it also will drop out or get irregular readings. I don't' think Fitbit is going to be able to change this inconsistency through firmware or software updates due to the ""anatomical limits"" of the technology. The good news is, if you take a min or two and reposition the device it can go back to an accurate reading and overall, your workout should be close to the correct amount of calories burned.‚ùñ The only other gripe I have is that the device can record ""faulty"" steps. Now, if I am out on a walk or ""walking"" it does just fine. BUT, I can sit (just did) and wave my arm around and steps will be recorded. I just logged 5 steps sitting and writing this review by waving my arm around. If you're a person that talks with your hands, this can problematic. The floors climbed is also cool and seems to be very accurate.‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëBOTTOM LINE‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëI give the Surge 4 stars. I really would like to see more consistent readings of the HR monitor during intense workouts and find a way to not have the device pick up ""false"" steps, but I realize that the technology is still young. The many pluses that come with the Surge (to me) outweigh the negatives, so I am happy overall with it.***If you like this review, please mark this review as helpful! Also, feel free to ask me questions Thank you for reading***

  It's probably over kill for what I use it for which is usually walking, cycling and I wear it all day. My wife purchased it for me May 2016 and by October 2016 the wristband formed bubbles at the bottom of the watch face. I called Fitbit tech support and they promptly sent a replacement watch. They told me that I should just put the old one in a recycle bin for electronics. Then earlier this week the band formed bubbles on the replacement watch. I called Fitbit tech support again and they're sending me another replacement watch since the warranty is good for one year. They told me again that after I receive the replacement I should just put it in a recycle bin for electronics. If they don't want the old one back that to me indicates they put no value on the watches they sell and must be way overpriced. They could have asked for it back and put a new band on it and sold it as refurbished or passed it off as new. So when the band on the replacement bubbles again it will be out of warranty and I'll toss it in the recycle bin for electronics and never purchase another Fitbit product. I'm not abusing it or wearing it in the shower or rain.I have a heart murmur and this was to help me monitor my heart rate as recommended by my cardiologist. My wife asked friend that has a Fitbit Blaze but then purchased the most expensive Fitbit at the time as a Birthday gift for me last year. I feel bad that my wife spent all that money for something that looks like junk when the wristband bubbles up.

  Sadly I can't recommend this Fitbit.  Do not buy.  Fitbit if you're reading this, read you forums.  You have a defective watch band and this units are failing at an alarming rate.I've been a long time Fitbit customer, so I really want to say good things here.  I've bought other Fitbits before (starting with the Fitbit one) as well as many other models for most of my family, but this model is defective.  The bands either break, crack or the newest problem is they bubble and then peal away from the main body.  Your expensive smart watch won't last a year.  I'm on my third Surge now, which Fitbit has sent to replace the first two.  Which would make you think, hey they're making this right.  Well you'd be wrong.  The Fitbit has a one year warranty, which does not extend when they send you a replacement.  In my case, they sent me a replacemention just a few months ago and now it's strap is pealing off!  But they won't replace their brand new three month old watch because the original warrranty is now expired.  That means if that watch is defective you have to hope that happened soon or you'll be stuck with $300 smart watch that won't stay on your wrist.  And again. Three months, third watch.  There is clearly a design problem with these.In short: don't buy.  Your watch will last about a year, then fall off your wrist and even the support people at Fitbit know to just send you a new watch.  But only within that first 12 months, and your watchs strap will fail I'm afraid,  When it happens with the replacement watch they send you, Fitbit won't do anything about this design flaw.  Seriously, how does a watch strap fail?  I've got watches from 30 years ago that haven't broken.  This is just shoddy.  Check the Fitbit forums, it's filled with owners complaining about this and again, you're stuck with it.  And to add insult to injury, if you ask for their help, they'll ""helpfully' offer you a discount on a different Fitbit (Seems like they know these units are defective).  Very very frustrating.

  I loved the fitbit 2 when I first got it and used it in tandem with the fitbit app on my smart phone.  It was convenient and fun to watch my progress on the app.  I did not want to use the rubber type band it came with, so I bought a cute silver bracelet for it and used it for a week until I realized that I had lost it and was so upset.  My girlfriend happen to tell me she's on her 3rd one!  I I replaced it with a flex 3 which is perfect for me.  Weeks later, I found the lost fitbit 2/bracelet underneath the seat of my car so I gave the fitbit 2 to my friend with the original rubber type band it came with and he seems to like it and uses it daily.  If your gonna use this, make sure you use the original rubber type band or use a durable accessory.

  Love my Fitbit 2. I also own the Alta HR but this is my go to because of its small size and the fact that it's waterproof. I own several replacemnt bands for it and love that I can have a new look with a simple switch.While the step counter is a bit off (I think it also tracks the movement of my arms when it's travking) and I don't get the detail of the sleep tracker like in my Alta HR, it does help me look at my phone less when out because of the text and call alerts.And don't be concerned that you won't feel the alerts.In addition to never missing a call or text alert, the heavy sleeper in me can still feel the silent alarms that I have set to wake me up for work each day.

  I have purchased two of these, build quality is better than most other Fitbits (thus 2 stars instead of 1) but the display is difficult, if not impossible, to read outdoors on a sunny day bright sunlight. Unfortunately, Fitbit has discontinued this model and the currently listed price of $267 is from rip-off artists (I bought mine at about $80) At this price and very limited availability, Amazon should remove the #1 product recommendation. Also the supporting software at Fitbit.com (the dashboard, and the community activity groups) are poorly maintained, with outages of essential parts lasting weeks to months, and more minor bugs, although reported, never seem to get fixed. Note that these support software problems are Fitbit wide, including their newest flagship models, not just for the 'One'. My recommendation would be to consider another manufacturer until Fitbit gets their act together.

  I've had this little guy for over a year now - I wanted to get some mileage out of it before I reviewed it - and I'm still a big fan.First - I opted with the Fitbit One because a.) it had high reviews and b.) I wanted something that did both sleep tracking (so Zip was out) and I didn't have to wear in an ugly bracelet on my wrist (so pretty much everything else was out). I usually keep this in my pocket or clipped to my bra - works great in both places.ACCURACY: when I first got it (and a few times since then) I walked around counting my steps then checked with the fitbit -each time it's been within about 3 steps of how many steps I counted out of 50, regardless of if I wear it on my wrist, clipped to my bra, or in my pocket. just now I stuck it on my wrist and shook my hand back and forth vigorously 20 times and it added on 8 steps, so if you really want to cheat the system you can - though it probably will take more effort to shake on extra steps than actually just walk. I haven't had any problems with it adding on a lot of steps after car rides. I had a baby 6 months ago and have found that it counts bouncing up and down to calm a fussy baby as a step, but I'm cool with that - it's pretty much like jogging in place. the floors climbed feature seems fairly accurate - I haven't actually spent a day counting how many times I go up and down our stairs to compare it and it think it sometimes will count walking up a steep hill as a flight of stairs (once again, I'm cool with that), but on days i'm cleaning the house and thus going up and down stairs more often than usual my flight count is significantly higher.  whether or not it gets your distance correct depends on how accurately you set your stride length - I think the easiest way to make sure it's set correctly is to go for a walk and set the GPS tracker on your phone if you have one, then once you get to 1 mile on the GPS check and see what your fitbit is telling you then adjust accordingly.SLEEP TRACKER:  it's cool, it shows when you're ""asleep"" (not moving), when your ""restless"", and when you're ""awake"" - there are two settings sensitive and normal, apparently normal is if you're wearing it on your wrist and sensitive is if you have it in a pocket or something (because some pajama's have pockets - you know, for when you need to hold stuff while you're sleeping . . .) I set it on normal because I wear it on my wrist. I tried it on sensitive for a while to see if it worked better - it just freaked me out and told me only 1/2 of my time in bed was spent sleeping - I started wondering if I really was tired and not well rested, even though I never felt like I had trouble sleeping before. . . -  just read the instructions and don't freak yourself out.  Often times it will show me ""restless"" times during the night when I am definitely awake nursing - I guess there's a certain movement threshold you have to pass to be considered ""awake"", so it's not 100% accurate in that regard. it also doesn't coach you in sleeping well - just gives you the raw data on what happened during your night. (which has been super helpful with nursing  - it's nice to see the trends of how long the baby's sleeping, how often we're getting up, how long we really are up for, etc. without having to have the presence of mind to make note of it while I'm half asleep).  you can set goals on the app for how much sleep you're aiming for each night and set goal go-to-bed and wake-up times. putting the fitbit into and out of sleep mode is super easy (you hold down the button till it buzzes) and if you forget to put it in sleep mode one night or accidentally let it run well into your morning it's easy to go in and fix the times on the app. I love the silent alarms - I was skeptical that a little thing buzzing on my wrist would wake me up - but it works great and my husband appreciates how quiet it is. there is no snooze - which is good for me because I'm one of those snooze five times type people - this forces me to set a realistic time to get up and do it (though to be honest, I set a second alarm 10 minutes after the first one just incase. . .) you can set as many alarms as you want and have them go of on any day you want, so if you want to set alarms to remind you to get up an move around every hour or have an alarm that only wakes you up on  * Note: I'm not a big fan of the little sleep wrist thing that comes with the fitbit. after a few months the velcro stated pulling it apart. For a while I cut off the top of  one of my husband's socks and wore it folded in thirds on my wrist with the fitbit tucked inside-  that worked OK but some nights the fitbit slipped out - now I have a cheap 3rd-party silicone wrist band thing made to fit the fitbit in it - it works great.DURABILITY: I have accidentally washed my fitbit twice and dried it once. it survived. And it counted the spin cycle as active minutes. The charge still lasts for a week or more. I don't recommend forgetting the fitbit in your laundry, but it has held up well to the wet and the heat. I wear it while working out and sweat has never seemed to be a problem for it. It's been over a year and is still working exactly the way it did when I got it. Two weeks ago the little plastic piece on the back of the silicone clip broke - I super glued it back together and so far so good. the clip itself would still be somewhat functional without that little plastic piece - it would just have a metal part poking out that could be poky- but you also can buy third-party replacement clips for $5 or spring for the actual Fitbit replacement clip  for 3X more if branding is important to you.APP - i Like the app a lot. I've used it both on a Samsung tablet (android) and on an Iphone and both work great. you can set daily goals, see how much of your daily goal you've achieved, get weekly/monthly/quarterly historical graphs, track your weight, amount of water drank, calories, etc. I also like that you can get rid of things you don't want on it - for example I don't track my calories so i took that tile off my app and don't have it sitting there wasting space. in the settings there is a spot to mark if you are pregnant or breastfeeding - I don't know exactly what that does - my guess is it ups your daily calorie allotment - and maybe takes that into consideration when it tells you how many calories you've burned.  I don't do the friends and competitions part of it - but there's a platform to connect with people you know and set little competitions or group goals - honestly the idea of me seeing what everyone else is doing and everyone seeing what I'm doing isn't very appealing, but it could be fun accountability if you set a goal with a friend/familyIMPACT ON YOUR LIFE: Know thyself. Having this won't inherently make you healthier. I got this because I like tracking things and this gave me a way to gamify my activity - I set goals and I can see exactly how close I am to hitting them each day - which is a strong motivation factor for me - at 8PM if I see that I'm still 4000 steps shy of my daily step goal I'm much more likely to suggest we take an after-dinner walk in the evening. I've been drinking more water because I'm keeping track of it.  It helped me track my activity level through my pregnancy and is helping me see how getting back in shape afterwards is going, I'm also glad I'll have this archived so when I get pregnant again I can see how I track compared to this pregnancy. If you're like me it will be strong motivation for you. If your highly competitive getting one of these then competing with your friends on it might work, or having an accountability partner who can see your daily activity may help keep you motivated. If none of those things pique your interest this probably isn't a good investment, but it is a well made product.

  In my opinion the Fitbit One is the best fitness tracker made!!! I am so bummed that They are not making it anymore!!!! It is sad that Amazon is capitalizing on this fact and have more than doubled the price of the original FItbit One. It is only so expensive now, because it isn't being produced anymore, which means they will no longer support it either. Fitbit is phasing it out.

  Would never buy another one off amazon! I had my old Fitbit One for a couple of years and it started acting up. I thought it would be a good idea to buy a new one in case my old one stopped working. Sure enough 2 months after I bought the back up one my old Fitbit stopped working. I went to take my new Fitbit out of the box to charge it. I left it on the charger for 4 hours and I went to push the button at the top to see if it was fully charged and it won't even turn on. Not happy that I spent $106 on a device that's junk. Went to see if I could return the item and it doesn't even give me the option to do that. Do NOT waste your money on this!

  Fitbit one was wonderful for the first 6 months. We had a great relationship. I stepped, hopped, salsa, shimmed, and my Fitbit picked up my steps. It.was.harmonious. MUAH!! Oh baby, it was good! Next thing I know, my Fitbit stopped synching.  We had to go through quite a bit of counseling...excuse me, troubleshooting, and FINALLY we were back in our honeymoon phase.  Next thing I know, my baby started to spaz and I found out that he was a cheap piece of CRAP. If you talk to his cousins  - Fitbit zip, HR, charge - you'll find out that this family doesn't live up to the hype. Gives you a good time for a few months, and then crashes and burns! over.rated.

  I bought this as a replacement for my wife's Blaze that quit.  Bought brand new at the military store (AAFES) and fresh out of the box, I had to contact Fitbit customer service and they have to send us a replacement because it was defective.  We can't return it at the BX because it's outside the 90-day window (bought as a backup when it went on sale).EVERY single Fibit we've had (around 6 total between the 2 of us with the Charge 2 and Blaze), we had to contact Fibit customer service to get the trackers replaced within the 1-year warranty period.  The trackers work great when they're working but they will predictably fail within the year.  Kudos to their customer service but you can bet that your tracker will fail within the year then get a replacement so you're getting < 2 years for the amount you're paying.  Five stars for customer service but absolutely one star for the durability/longevity of their products.Next one we'll be getting will be the Apple Watch.  Expensive but should last longer than the Fitbits.

  I purchased a box of Band-Aid Brand Tru-Stay Clear Spots Bandages for Discreet First Aid, All One Size, 50 Count and I was so surprised with the low quality of the product.  I have been buying band-aid brand bandages for years and years and have always been pleased with the results until now. First, it was difficult to open the individual bandages and I had to tear a circle around the whole thing to get it out.  Next, it was challenging to get the plastic things off the bandage.  Third, the band-aid did a horrible job sticking. I understand that these are not waterproof but one tiny drop of water and it came right off.  Again, I have been buying band-aid brand products for years and have been pleased in the past which is why I was surprised with the very low quality.

  It is absurdly difficult to remove one of these clear spots from its wrapper without tearing the adhesive or contaminating the center pad, and that's without any hurry involved.  It's the 21st century, Band-Aid, and this is the best you can do? I think it's unacceptable.

  **What it is and why it's good**I've bought a lot of ""spot bandages"". These bandages are definitely very good.1. First, I love that they are clear, yet the square pad part is not clear. When that part is clear, it means the bandage cloth part is bright white, which is very noticeable. So this bandage's design is very smart in that way in terms of aesthetics.2. Also, this bandage sticks for DAYS. I am a bandage snob and typically only use fabric bandages. These are plastic, but I gave them a shot, and I have to say they are pretty good for plastic.3. They stick almost as well as fabric ones (emphasis on 'almost'). These are definitely some of the best plastic ones I've tried.**What you should be aware of**They are a little difficult to open, because they don't give you the little tabs that a lot of bandages give you. You have to basically rip into it, which I'm always afraid I'll also rip into the bandage itself. Check out my pics. I show you what I mean on this. To me, this downfall is not big enough to take away a star, but I mention this because it may be helpful to some who may care about this aspect.I always read reviews before purchasing and find some quite helpful, so I hope you find this review helpful!

  Oh Band-Aid are you kidding me. These are awful. Can‚Äôt remove the paper without tearing or stretching the adhesive. Better have tiny fingers and nails to get into the protective envelope. And discrete seriously. They look terrible if on the face. Just a brown dot. I threw these away and purchased McKesson dots. They are great. Easy to use and trim. Blend in with skin very well. Was given a sample by the skin cancer center and I see why. They work.

  There are two little strips that overlay the guauze which have to be removed. The first one comes away easily, the 2nd one won't come away at all, rendering the bandage useless. If I pull hard enough, it doesn't come free but stretches the plastic until it rips, which does not make for a non-visible look.

  After trying to remove the lower glue protector paper it destoyed the whole bandage or left unremovable paper on the bandage. For the price they went to the garbage can instead of a return at the point of trying to open the 9th bandage without getting a usable bandage. I tried a 10th and 11th bandage from the second and third box with the same lot numbers and they were unusable. You can't. determine if the problem is in manufacturing, product age or heat in storage.

  Having just tried a competitor's brand, I went running back to these Band-Aid bandages. These work perfectly -- they are thin and unobtrusive, stick incredibly well (even on slightly damp skin, or skin with newly applied lotion), are super flexible, and stay on. They're also easy to remove without trauma.They are not waterproof, but I have showered with these on, and find that they dry fairly quickly, so water doesn't get excessively trapped inside.Despite the product description as of this review (8/15/19) indicating that these bandages are all one size, they actually are not. This is a variety pack, with some very large kneecap sized bandages, a large number of standard sized bandages, some mini ones and some in between.I highly recommend these - won't go back to any other.

  As a mom (NOT a medical expert) I try to always have a box of character Band-Aids like this around for small incidents. The two sizes included aren't perfect for every possibility, but cover most simple childhood scrapes. I find that for most situations, these are just sticky enough so that they don't fall off too easily, but aren't too traumatic to remove. And of course the characters (in this case, Paw Patrol) provide some real benefit in terms of soothing and distracting a hurt child. Your only issue might be a child wanting to wear them as stickers when they aren't needed!These probably aren't the ONLY bandages you'll ever need in your first aid kit; I like having a wider range of sizes and some waterproof ones for different situations. But as a mom, I think these are a great basic for soothing and protecting the most common little kid incidents.

  Even when you are not dealing with a cut, scrap or skin burn... you have to have one of these Band-Aids.  The characters are so fun and the Band-Aids are so colorful.  They come in a cute little box and young children cannot resist them.  They stick on ok and do the job but lets be honest... they're stickers not for wounds.  If I didn't put them on the tip top shelf of the medicine cabinet the box would last less than a day.  They don't seem to be very waterproof nor do they stick very well.  But children also play and relocate them on their bodies considering every little minor injury needs a paw patrol Band-Aid asap!  Compared to cloth or medical grade ones these aren't nearly as good.  However, they make the pain to away and put a smile on their face.  For anything serious we will stick to the heavy duty less attractive ones but for small cuts and scrapes my FSA will buy me these to turn frowns upside down.

  I purchased these for the price but not even worth that to me. I had a cut on my arm and i used this bandaid after a while i started ro itch on the corner of the bandaid (not even where the cut was) i ignored the itching. Once i removed the band i saw it had left a pink rash on my skin and bumps. I somehow thought it was just me and put a new one on. A few minutes later started to itch once again. I removed it and just threw them all away. After removing itch went away.

  My daughter is a Paw Patrol fan and absolutely loves these band-aids!  These are the only band-aids than can cure a boo-boo for her.  They seem to last a long time for a child too, so that is an added benefit.  They do not fall off but also do not hurt when taken off, so a win-win for a band-aid!

  My 3 year old loves these. He got poked by a blackberry thorn pretty good. It was a tiny poke but must have hit just the right spot on his finger because it was dripping blood everywhere. I think he was more freaked out by the blood than the actual poke. Anyway, I pulled out one of these and he stopped crying instantly. So naturally I bought 3 more boxes. :)

  Our 6 year old daughter loves these. Unfortunately, in addition to being more expensive than regular band-aids, they also don't adhere as well (perhaps aiming to prevent pain on removal?), unless they're sticking to themselves, which like all band-aids they do extremely well. It's quite easy to go through a box of 20 pretty fast, between their popularity, band-aids falling off and getting replaced, and self-stick mistakes. Note that the 20 includes 10 full size and 10 about 75% smaller.

  Band Aid is a staple here, with tough little girls that like their character band aids these are great.  I only gave it 3 stars as I feel the adhesive on these is sub par to others we've tried, even other licensed character Band Aid brand.  These just won't stay on, not even on me, for any length of time. A bit disappointed in these particular one's but overall we've always been happy with Band Aid, we will buy other characters moving forward.

  I have bought these several times. I have also bought other brands to try to save money and I come back to these. They are the best for cleaning wounds, holding the cleaner like betadine or normal saline. Then they are great for covering wounds. They are soft and absorbent if there is a significant amount of drainage. They are not scratchy like others can be. They are also a really good deal for the price to have such a quality product at such a good price. I unfortunately have wounds frequently and I used to be a wound care RN and worked in the burn center. I can safely say wounds are my thing although I don‚Äôt like them on myself so much. But I am very particular about y dressings so when I find a good product like this one I definitely want the world to know about it.

  The description states ""(pack of 3)"" and I ordered four of the ""(pack of 3)"".  What I received was four INDIVIDUAL boxes, not the four packs of 3.  I should have seen a total of 12 boxes of 25 count 2x2 Gauze Pads.  This is DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING and amounts to theft when they charge $11.18.  That makes each of the four boxes I received $11.18 and $0.44 per bandage, not the advertised $11.18 per ""(pack of 3)"" - I should have seen twelve boxes and $0.15 per bandage as it clearly shows on the advertised page.

  The older you get the more important it is to have at least an annual check-up by your dermatologist. This is especially true if you're past Social Security age and as a child weren't instructed to protect your skin from the sun.  Of course moving to Florida 39 years ago probably was the icing on the cake.Since I had a strange looking bluish mark on my lower ear lobe I decided that I should go to a new dermo for a check-up.  Lo and behold the blue mark was nothing to worry about, but the melanoma they found on my upper back resulted in a deep wound with 66 stitches.  These non-stick gauze pads came in really handy since the incision was about 6 inches long.A year later I visited the dermo again and this time they found one on my left shoulder.  This was removed with about 86 stitches and the incision was 9 inches long.  A combination of these Band Aid pads with some larger Curad nonstick pads covered the wound nicely.  This one took a lot longer to heal because of where it was and how movement impacted the healing.Both of the melanomas (and one squamish cell) were removed with clear margins, allegedly becoming old war wounds that shouldn't act up again.  But that wouldn't have been the case if I had ignored the need to see the dermatologist on a regular basis.  Please take my advice and check out any odd looking lesions.  It could save your life.

  As a band-aid user my entire life, these tough strips also known as flex strips are the ones I prefer to use for nasty situations anywhere on my body.  The are the best band-aids for sticking to the body without loosening or ending up with edges turned up.  They stay 'glued' for days on end and just don't give way,, not in my experience, anyway.  They pull up easily and without flinches of 'ouch'.  I've really learned to love these over the last few years of use.  They do cost a lot, though, often almost $1 a tough strip, give or take a few pennies, and that is way too much for me.  I always try to bulk up with sales.  Regardless, it's a product that seems to do what is advertised in that it flows with the body and adheres until you don't want it to anymore.  Then it is removed easily.  It gets my vote.

  Be careful if you use this product. If you have sensitive skin or thin skin, or if you‚Äôre an elderly person that naturally  has thinner skin, This is not a good product for you. It is so strong when you pull it off it rips your skin right off.

  It's really tough to write a review of Band-Aids... because, you know, they're Band-Aids! How great can they be?!Well, let me tell you how great these are:My husband and I usually buy whatever is cheap and plentiful; typically the generic option. The thing I have found is that the generic bandages don't have the same perseverance as the brand names do... especially during the summer, when the cheaper options tend to fall off on their own after a couple hours of wear.Not only are these Band-Aids the cloth type, which breathe easier and don't tend to be as sweaty, but they also do a really great job of staying put. These one are the large size, so they'll do a great job of staying put on skinned knees, the awkward rubbed raw spots on the tops (or heels) of your feet where your new sandals got you, really anywhere that needs a large bandage.Don't get the Up and Up or whatever else's generic option... buy Band-Aid!

  These stick well!!! Especially if you clean your skin with rubbing alcohol and apply them after you're all dry.I do object to only getting 10 bandages for the price, though. If you have a recurring pressure sore they can get expensive using them every day,  but pressure sore dressings cost ten times this amount for just one! Still, A box of 20 would be nice.Can't complain about the size. The pads aren't rough and don't stick to wounds. They're good bandages which are NOT easy to find!

  Band-aid has always been the ""go-to"" product for minor cuts and scrapes.This addition to their line-up keeps up the good work.  These are definitely tougher and stronger than the standard band-aids and stick like there's no tomorrow, yet come off when you need to change them without removing patches of skin. (Hair is another matter but they all do that.)These are quite wide and give good coverage but can be tough to put on a small finger or any area that bends a lot, but that's hardly unique to this product.I recommend these without reservation.  They do what they claim to do and do it well.Don't neglect small wounds, practice good first-aid habits and consult a health-care pro if in doubt or in a crisis.

  These are great for elbows, knees and feet. If some think they 'stick' to agressively when it's time to remove or replace, then just use a little ""Citrus' based glue softner.. (like Goof Off), but buy a ""CITRUS"" formula that is not harsh on the skin. (Goof Off is NOT for skin!).The Tough Strips  Band-Aid is a superior product that pads, and sticks! A good repeat buy.

  Not enough plastic around the sides (ends are OK.) which means that while it seals well in circumference of a finger, the sides open up and let in water/moisture. What this means is your wound stays soggy wet all day. I even got the bacteria growth smell after 8-12 hours. Gross. Had to sanitize. Like the idea, not recommended.

While they only last a day or two due to not being remotely waterproof (I didn't expect they would be), and the smaller size being difficult to use in some areas, they do serve their purpose! If he's happy to use them then I'm happy too!

  This is absolutely nothing like it is in the picture.  Yes, they are technically avengers-related, but I wanted the ones that appeared in the listing.  Amazon, get your crap together and start actually putting some effort into quality control.  And yes, I did purchase from Amazon directly, and not another seller on the marketplace.

  This is just one of several first-aid tapes I keep on hand. Paper tapes are not strong enough for use around joints, and wider athletic tapes are often too bulky. I recently used this thin tape to stabilize a couple of fingers that I had accidentally cut: this prevented me from continually bending and using those fingers, allowing the cut to stay closed and heal.Skin has to be completely clean and dry‚Äîno moisture, lotion, etc.‚Äîor this tape will not stick! When possible, I wrap it around so it's sticking to itself. It is waterproof to a minimal extent (stays OK when I wash and dry my hand), but don't expect to submerge it for any length of time. The adhesive is not that strong, which means it is easy to remove without irritating skin.

  I actually don‚Äôt use these bandaids for my heels (anymore), though they worked great when I had to cover a blister. I use these for blemishes on my face. I clean my skin at night, pat dry, then apply one of these over the forming/offending area. Moisturize around the bandaid, go to bed, and sleep with the bandaid on the acne spot.When I wake up, 9/10 times, the bandaid has absorbed the contents of the blemish, leaving my skin flat (albeit a little dry).My skin has loved this. I don‚Äôt have to pop blemishes anymore, which speeds up the healing process immensely, and reduces risk of introducing bacteria to the area. Just don‚Äôt put any acne cream on under the bandaid prior to application‚Äîyou‚Äôll irritate the heck out of your skin. (My skin is nowhere near ‚Äúsensitive,‚Äù and I made this mistake... the results looked similar to a chemical burn.)

  Best product ever if you've ever encountered cellulitis in your life you'd know that it is not easy to get rid of nor is going to the hospital to have it removed by a professional.  Ouch. This little bandaid is like a surgeon , $275-$400 saved in hospital bills , and the pain and 6 hours you'd spend in the ER all in one bandaid. TRUST MEA! put one on and leave it till you see a white pocket form in elastic bandage and when you remove it your cellulitis will have surfaced and healed all by its self . amazed by my secret little discovery.

  These were useless. I always have trouble with blisters on my heels when I travel because I walk for hours on end (sometimes 13 hrs a day) so I need reliable aids. These didn't take 13 hours to start rubbing off and falling apart. After a short time my shoes rubbed right through them! It created a hole in the bangage and just kept right on scrapin' ma' skin off! That was on my right foot; on my left, it just came clean off. It only worked (and only for cushion) once I put a nexcare waterproof bandaid over it. I shouldn't have to reinforce my blister bandaid with another brand's bandaid. Fail---at least for my needs. Of your needs are minimal, may be worth a try, otherwise, try something else first.

  We purchased this product to keep in a small first aid kit in our RV and our backpacks when hiking.  This past weekend I cut the tip of my finger with a knife while in our RV.  I immediately pulled out the hydro seal bandage and applied to the tip of my finger which was bleeding constantly.  I ensured I had a good, tight seal and it worked better than any bandaid I've ever used.  I had to leave it on my finger for two days just to ensure my skin had sealed a bit and wasn't bleeding but that was due to the cut not the bandage.  I'm buying another pack of these to keep on hand.

  I saw these blister covers in a 'must-have for travel' article by Buzzfeed. We visited family in Europe and I knew there was going to be lots of walking. After my heel got torn up from a 10 minute walk in dressy shoes on a special night out, I put one of these on the blister and followed the directions on the box that said not to touch it until it started to fall off. It was a small but painful blister and after I put one of these pads on I completely forgot about it until 3 days later when it started to fall off. I was SHOCKED at the amount of gross junk it pulled out of such a small blister, I was mildly disgusted. I was surprised that I walked almost 20 miles for the 3 days I had this thing on and never felt a thing. It healed amazingly quick and will always keep these on hand.

  I lost a fingernail in an accident and while it regrows I wanted a bandage that would allow it to breathe and survive hand washing during the day at work. I had never heard of Skin-Flex before, but I tried it even though the price was steep at $11 at my local drugstore, and they are great!! The adhesive holds and after getting wet, blotting it carefully results in a dry bandage within a minute or so. Best of all? When I needed another box, I looked on Amazon and found the identical product for $6.99!! I love Amazon.

  These are my favorite band-aids / bandages and seem to work the best. I gave them four stars because I hate all of the tiny ones that comes with them...wish there was a package with the two biggest sizes instead because the little ones are like child size. Because of that issue, they end up folding over or peeling off and it gets frustrating. They stay clean and nice, though. The larger ones stay put and have good coverage. I pick my cuticles and this helps me prevent it. Other small issue, the adhesive does get stuck to your nail and is really tricky to remove, even with alcohol. This is me being picky, though. Buy these band-aids. They're good!

  PRO TIP: I don‚Äôt generally need these for injuries, but I do keep a stock of these in place of strapless bras. By FAR the the best thing I‚Äôve come across. I HATE strapless bra‚Äôs, I‚Äôm a petite woman with DD‚Äôs and these hold them up with pretty decent shaping abilities!! AWESOME for going braless when you are too large to get away with it. The small skin flex also work great for helping to shape things, but generally speaking, one of these big ones really does the trick. They will stay in place for a couple days, just be careful removing, it‚Äôs still a bandaid in a very sensitive location.

  Got this bandaid post surgery to wear under compression garment. This was the only bandaid that was slim enough to not rub and irritate. Also, it does stay on in water. That said‚ÄîIt is a bit hard to get off so you have to use your nail to peel it.I have irritation to most bandaids and this did not cause redness or itchiness or pain.It is important to note the actual gauze portion of the bandaid is flexible- meaning it has grooves in it. I did have a small piece of the gauze stick to my skin once, but I attribute that to it being under a compression garment.Overall these are the only bandaids I plan on using from now on.

  Don't bother getting these as they will come off as soon as they get wet. The paper wrap also won't tear off as designed. I don't know if they are old or a mfg problem but you have to tear down the sides to get to the band-aid. They are supposed to separate at the top and tear down. I have since ordered the clear 3/4"" and the 1"" and they stick very well. They even stick through a hard workout on the elliptical where I get very sweaty They are also less noticeable then the plastic tan band Aids. Very disappointed in these.

  I've been ordering these for years.  This is my ninth time ordering these bandages.  They were previously what I considered to be the best general purpose bandage you could buy, but as you can see they redesigned the pad and they are now inferior.  What grinds my gears is that they are being sold as the same bandage, with the same barcode, even though they are not the same.  This completely erodes customer trust and I will not be buying these again.

  I work construction and such and need band aids that are large, band aids that will hold up to hand washes and heavy work. Ordered these for years in the 60 pack from Amazon. They will survive a shower, last an easy 24 hours and used to have a pad that had good coverage and held a glob of antibiotic ointment. This last purchase has a pad that is not nearly as wide and a bit longer and simply doesn't work. I see there are a lot of one star reviews with the same complaint.It is unlikely that the new design is cheaper to make, so it's hard to understand why J&J would make the effort to change a popular product with no competitor that I have ever been able to find.In looking at my previous orders, the product referenced is this new version even though my previous purchases were not this new design (see photo comparison). The individual band aid wrapper has the same code and numbers on it (see photo) so I guess this is a manufacturer's doing and not some discount product line.But I purchased a box of the old style at the drug store today with the big pad (see photo) which makes me wonder if vendors have an option to stock the alternate version or whether the change is recent enough that I am just purchasing disappearing stock.I guess we will be driven to carry a box of gauze pads, adhesive tape (the old kind that stuck to things) and a scissors to replicate the good band aids.

  The design now offered by Amazon of Tough Strips is only good for tiny cuts and scrapes. I participate in many outdoor activities and you can count on tough strips to stay on. But they are now only useful for very small wounds, nor more than 3/8 by 3/4 inch.  Get any of the the great TS adhesive on a larger wound and it will pull it open when you take off the bandage.  Ouch! The new design of tough strips offered by Amazon is useless for me and I would bet for many others. Buyer beware! Amazon, bring back the earlier version with the wider gauze pad!

  I was looking for something that can hold on the skin a long time but gentle on the wound. Also something that is water proof and a bit wider. I had purchased one in a pharmacy earlier that claimed to have these but was nothing close to it. I went on Amazon and found this. I received the product the next day I ordered it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it that fast based on my shipping choice. That‚Äôs a plus, and I was also impressed by the packaging.After using this product, I give it a 5 star because as they said, it is fully and truly waterproof. You can use it in the shower, pool or expose it to rain or water and it will stay glued together and not peel off like others. It has sufficient width and the band is big enough to cover big cuts or large wounds. The adhesive will make it hold to the skin for as long as you need it, even longer. The adhesive may irritate tender skin a little if you try to remove it in a hurry, but if you remove it gently, it will be just fine. I will go for this any day. I recommend this in your first aid box.

  Product title, description, and images show that it is a 2-pack of bandages. Other product type selections for the band-aids are also packs of 2 or more.

  I did not have much luck with these due to the purpose I needed them for, but I think for almost any other use they'd be great.  They stick VERRRRRY well, almost too well; I can see them staying on for days.  My downfall was I needed to wrap this around one finger, which worked great, but I couldn't get it off easily AT ALL.  It stuck to my nail and I had a bad experience not realizing HOW sticky it was when trying to get off my fingernail.  It also left a ton of sticky residue, which didn't come off the nail well, stayed on for days.  I ended up buying a different bandaid, and by the time I remember to return them, I as past the return date.  I won't buy these again for the purpose I need them for, but I could imagine they would be great for a knee or elbow, something that bends a lot and you need a bandaid to stay on.  They'd be perfect for that type of thing.  Also note that they have sticker around the padding, which again, would be great in most cases - just not mine.

  I just hate those expensive variety boxes of Band-Aids in the grocery store:  they assume that everyone has five children under 10 in their household.  By that I mean, they're chock-full of itty-bitty Band-Aids.  These, on the other hand, are all the same adult size, with a 1-inch width,  and I love that the gauze part is the same width as the sticky part: sometimes I have some more delicate areas right next to the target and I don't want to put sticky on it.  These are large enough so that I can put a dot of Neosporin on, wrap the Band-Aid comfortably all around my finger, and not have the goo ooze out of the sides.  Buying from Amazon, these are also a great value: for a lot less than what I would pay for a variety box at the grocery store, I now have a lot of excellent, adult-size bandages.  Finally, they are quite water-resistant.  This morning I put one on my finger, washed hands off and on, took a shower mid-day and washed my hair, and the Band-Aid was still hanging in there tightly!  I removed and replaced it because it was soaking wet, but still it's so nice to have a Band-Aid that doesn't come off with every hand wash!

  The old kind of band-aids that aren't complete pieces of crap. I have learned over the years that while many non-brand items are just find, band-aids seem to be an exception. I have gone through so many cheap vinyl-plastic type bandaids and finally decided to stick with the originals. These are comfortable, breathable, and stay on until you want them to come off. I use these in all my first aid kits and am very pleased. This box comes with about a years worth of band-aids in different sizes.

  I love the cloth-feel of these, and they don't irritate my skin - but what is super annoying is as soon as you put them on, they start shedding threads and I have to keep cutting the strings off.  It's similar to an unfinished hem on cloth - it's just keeps  shredding off string by string - but they don't just fall off - you have to cut them off because there is still adhesive on one side and then your scissors gets gummy.

  I love these band-aids! I bought them a few months ago because the bandages that came in my first aid kit were running low. I didn‚Äôt have super high expectations, but I am beyond impressed with their quality.I accidentally cut myself shaving in the shower the other night. When I got out, I put on a bandage. And then forgot about it, which is unheard of for me because I have very sensitive skin and even in the teeny-tiniest little tag will drive me crazy. And THEN, three days later after two additional showers, the bandage was still there!!! I‚Äôll admit it was a bit ratty, but I‚Äôve never had a bandaid make it through one shower before, let alone two.I am very, very happy with this purchase and will absolutely continue to buy these after my current box runs out.

  This assorted pack has everything you should need for minor cuts and scapes of every side. No more cutting Band-Aids to make them work with smaller cuts or hoping you have the right size to fit in a funny place. There's plenty of sizes and enough that you won't run out trying to heal a single wound.These fabric Band-Aids work great. They stick great, bend with ease, and stay on through hand-washing and showers without issue. They also dry out, which many of the plastic bandages never seem to do.I'm a big fan of this large assorted box and will order again if I ever reach a point where I'm running low.

  Goes on easy, stays on, seems to be resistant to water (its never come off for me).  Just a recommendation.  We diabetics with nephropathy have problems picking up things.  If you put rabbit ears on the bottom to make it easy for us to detach the protective papers, that would be great.  I pick at them and then usually drop them on the floor, but ears would make it much better.  Last thing, we already pay a ton for drugs, could you possibly reduce the price or help us to get medicare to carry the cost?  Thanks for your product and your help.  Pastor Timblin

  I got 3 different sizes in this order that was stated to be all the same size.  The 2 surprise sizes are a bit bigger and a bit smaller although most were of the advertised size.  Although these fabric kind will fray if you're wearing one on a hand and using that hand, they stick very, very well and are comfortable.  So much better than those plastic ones that come off so easily and feel awful.  Good band-aids, just was surprised to get the different sizes.

  OK, so, yeah...I'm really truly excited about these Band-Aids!!! I find myself kind of hoping for a small cut just so I can use them again. These are the most pimp Band-Aids ever! I was a die-hard cloth Band-Aid fanatic my whole life and found myself without one recently. These were part of a sampler pack I had hanging around, so I slapped one on my ring toe (which I had nicked with clippers) with modest expectations. Suffice to say I bathed and showered multiple times with it on and it never budged, peeled, or looked dirty (?!?!)...I was like, WHAT IS THIS MAGIC BAND-AID VOODOO? Thinking it was a fluke, I moved on...then got a shaving nick a week later (I need to be more careful, obviously) and used another. AWESOME AGAIN. I ordered a whole box and don't plan on looking back. Do yourself a favor and buy these Band-Aids! And to address the reviews who talk about them being tough to wrangle and hard to put on, just be careful...its true you can't be quite as carefree/slapdash with the application with these as with other Band-Aids, but it's well worth the extra 10 seconds of effort.

  I bought these band-aids to cover up incision sites post-surgery and take a shower (the incisions are being held together with surgical glue, and need to be kept dry). I was assured because of the brand name and the ""100% waterproof"" guarantee.I applied 4 band-aids to the 4 incision sites. At the end of a brief shower when I pulled them off water gushed out and the pad was soaked. Not only were they 0% waterproof, they had actually held the water in ‚Äì exactly what they were not supposed to do.

  Flexible fabric, all one size. These are the only band-aids I ever need and they seem to be impossible to find in stores in my area.I really like that the fabric allows for good air flow and evaporation...so even if you get them wet, they don't end up trapping a lot of water against your skin. And they stay on forever! If you're able to put them somewhere (like around a finger) where you can overlap one end over the other...they almost never come off!

  My husband would give these bandages a 5 because he LOVES fabric bandages since they are more flexible.  And he loves this brand because these bandages stay adhered to themselves when wrapped around a finger so they don't unravel.  He has trouble with other brands that stick fine to the skin, but when you wrap it around the finger, it doesn't stick to itself.  This brand is great.  I only took off 1 point in the score because they have to get replace so frequently during the day if on your finger (which is where we get all our cuts).  The fabric absorbs the water the instant a drop gets on it.  So even begin very careful to leave out the finger from running water, a drips will inevitably get on it and require replacement.

  Sometimes Amazon's Choice isn't really what you would like, so just be aware and careful.  These are 3/4"" and what I had wanted was 1"" but I still purchased these because I didn't want a variety of sized that I would never use.  I like how they stick so easily even on knuckles and places that bend.  Although they are only meant to stay on for 24 hours, I have kept them on for longer, but 24 hours is really all that they should stay on.  Overall nice, but next time I will look for the one inch ones.

  Amazon shipped the Band-Aids and another brand All Health, in a pouch, and of course everything got smashed. One Band-Aid's sleeve was opened and compromised. If you can order a few other things with the bandages in your next order, so that Amazon ships everything in a box, then it maybe worth while to buy bandages from Amazon. (But then again the bandages can still get smashed.)

  My Little kitty, is  probably the most active honest and diverse and liberty of our time, as Rocky & Bullwinkle were in theirs and remain so. It must also be noted that the detente, positive poli-sci reactions and controversies yet ongoing between Borris and Natasha,  Rocky and Bullwinkle  probably opened doors for personages (characters) such as My lil Kittty to be born -- they show an integrity and conviction of purpose in maturity that Sen. B. Sanders failed to exhibit entirely (and his Album was notably simply marketing for a career groomed for blunted accomplishments much likeness to Boris can be seen here.

  My daughter loves them, and so do I. Only problem is that we go through them like they're water because of course every hangnail/sliver/imaginary injury requires Hello Kitty bandaid.Cutest thing is when the manly man fiance sports one.

  These are cute and get the job done. Always come back to this brand of bandages. Kids love em and so do I. They work well but obviously aren‚Äôt waterproof so they don‚Äôt hold up very well for water activities. Come in a variety of sizes and the shipping was quick and well packaged. Love the prints!

  I love these bandages for many reasons. I am a healthcare provider and for years have used ""hydrocolloid"" dressings with my patients. They were very expensive and  not generally available to public. Then I found these.  They absorb mild amounts of drainage (such as a broken blister), stay on for at least 3 days (including showers,  sock changes,  sleeping). They seal and absorb well and accelerate healing. I really highly recommend these.  I keep some in my bag and my desk in case I have a bad run in with beautiful shoes.

  I saw this trend on TikTok and love learning new tricks for skincare and buying products. This was a fun concept that I had to see for myself. After seeing a few people call it BS I wonder if it's because they got bored and wanted to see the results ASAP even though using it for acne takes HOURS as recommended even just using for a bandaid. This isn't a five minute face mask - the results come with patience...Lots and LOTS of patience. I wouldn't recommend anyone to use it if they don't intend on wearing the bandaids for at least 24 hours. I personally use them for body pimples, zits, and boils - that way I can forget I even have the bandaids on and it'll start peeling when it's ready to come off. What surprised me most about using this for skincare is it does a decent job at pulling out blackheads/whiteheads and healing milia bumps!!

  I‚Äôve gone through a couple of boxes of these trying different things.  If you stay at home and wear these they‚Äôll work fine.  My feet sweat because I work outside.  These melted to my socks and have ruined very nice lightweight wool socks (you can‚Äôt get the adhesive off once it‚Äôs on there without damaging the sock.  This also makes it painful to pull off after a few days since it sticks more the hotter your feet get (that sounds great until you have to peel it off and it‚Äôs fairly painful vs a regular bandaid).

  hands-down the best Band-Aids around! They worth every penny you pay.

  The only critique I have is that they don't have a box with higher quantities. I have developed hammer toes on my right foot in my old age and so I get blisters easily on my toes because they press up more into the top of the shoe. I guess the company thinks blisters and sores are occasional things, but for people with ""issues"" with their feet it would be nice to get a bigger package and not have to buy four boxes at a time.

  Unlike any bandages I have seen before, these come loose and unwrapped inside a case.If the case wasn‚Äôt quadruple the capacity needed for the bandages, and non biodegradable plastic (another addition to overgrown landfills or to the floating plastic garbage continent in the ocean) with a plasticized label, I would buy these because they reduce waste and ongoing permanent damage to the world we leave for the next generation.I don‚Äôt need a bigger package to make me think I am getting more than I actually am. E What I need is not to feel quite so much guilt over how I contribute to the problem instead of the solution.

  This product was great, especially for long term use, but if you want to take it off a day or two in, forget about it. These bandages are designed to stay on for many days, at LEAST until the bandage starts to naturally come off, which is quite a few days after you put it on. I wore one bandage for three days during a music festival, and it was not even beginning to fall off by the end. It is EXTREMELY waterproof and was still completely sealed after three showers.The bandage is supposed to swell and create a white bubble over the blister, though I did not see this stage which may have occurred while my shoes were on for hours.I recommend this product for people who need instant and long-lasting relief from blisters, but I personally prefer some air exposure which was difficult to achieve with this product because of how adhesive it is. Overall, it achieves exactly what it sets out to do! Be careful with removal though! Not too soon! Otherwise it is painful and can make the injury worse.

  Unfortunately i am prone to blisters in different places on my feet and mole skin is just not something i like using.  I have been using different sizes of these bandages for years.  I probably have never left them on long enough for the healing process since my main goal was to safe my feet so i could keep walking on vacation.  I have these stashed in different places because i don't use them a lot, but when i need one and don't have it i am miserable (i hate blisters). If you are like me, i definitely recommend buying!

  I must start by saying that the only reason I don't suggest 5 stars for this Band-Aid product, is that I've discovered Nexcare adhesive bandages, which I consider 5 star (comfortable, durable, protective).  Now . . . on with the Band-Aid review . . . .These are, of course, Band-Aid quality, which is, of course, quite good.  They stick well, have Band-Aid strength (some popular brands tear easily), have perforations to allow breathing, have a cute Nickelodeon Shimmer and Shine graphic, and this is a decent usable assortment.  The assortment is ten 3/4""x3"" (a standard useful full size), and ten 5/8""x2 1/4"" (smallish, but big enough to easily wrap around tiny fingers).  No useless ""dots"" or micro-size strips.  Made in Brazil.  Made without natural rubber latex.Again, my favorite adhesive bandage has become Nexcare.  But these Band-Aids are well known as a reliable, good quality product - and if you want a fun graphic for little girls (or big girls), these work great.

  I picked out this band aid kit because I love the character showing on the box.  I am not a parent, nor do I watch Nikolodeon so I am not really familiar with the characters.  But pictures are cute.  I teach chidren's yoga and I thought that if I ever came across kranky kid in a class, I could give them this fun band aid to heal their little wounded ego during the yoga class.  It will distract them, it is playful and it will make the child feel care for.  I know this may be the silliest application of the band aid kit for the kids, but I just could not resist.

  I like these bandages just fine. Band-Aid brand usually delivers a good product. They come in sensible assorted sizes - nothing tiny or useless you'll end up throwing away. Or worse, combining with the useless sizes from the next box, until you've collected 3 boxes of tiny bandages and shoved them in some unknown drawer so that the one time you need them, you've no idea where they've gone off to. No fear of that here!I do advise, that whenever you buy these, you take a peak at the price first. So far, they're cheaper at just about any store I shop at here in town rather than the prices Amazon has shown.

  These band-aids are pretty cute and there are several different patterns through the box. With two sizes - the regular size and a smaller one - these are handy to have around. I am keeping this box in my truck actually.They definitely stick and stay on even if you get them a little wet. After using one on a smaller cut on my pinkie finger for two days, it was actually a bit difficult to remove. There was a light layer of sticky residue left behind from the sticky ends. Nonetheless,my little cut has healed properly.

  I received these free for review. Sure they are good bandages, and yes my 4-year-old daughter loves them, but holy cow the price! I can buy 5 times as many bandages, of the same Band-Aid brand even, for the same cost... if they don't have Shimmer and Shine on them. I want to please my daughter, but learning not to be wasteful is something I want to teach her also. I will not be buying more of these particular bandages.I object.

  These really stick and move with you. They're large enough for a kid's knees, and even for an adult, unless you skin your knee from top to bottom (which I did a few days ago). I have been using two of these, placed sideways, to cover the entire wound. It works great. While I change my dressing twice a day, these stick so that I have to really pull them off (though that's only around the edges -- they never stick to the wound).I'm very happy with these, and I bought several more boxes.

  I found this product about 8 years ago at the local cvs store and it has gotten popular over the years. The key to use this product is to let it do its ‚Äúadvance healing‚Äù which is seal the wound inside this band-aid for as long as it can stick to it, but make sure you clean the wound first before you put this on. Don‚Äôt use any onitment or dressing for the wound as well. This is not like the traditional band-aid where you have to kinda change it every time when it gets dirty or wet. It is also water proof so you don‚Äôt feel the ‚Äúouch‚Äù feeling when it gets wet. This is the only band-aid I would use even for my paper cuts.

  By far the best hydrocolloid bandage. Maybe not the best value, but certainly the best quality.  Make sure you read the instructions because they do not work like traditional bandages. I find they work best on a fresh wound ‚Äî before it has scabbed.  My friend did not listen to me or read the instructions, and he put it on a semi-fresh, but scabbed, wound and then tried to change it the same day, and it pulled off the scab and caused a lot of pain.  But these are meant to stay on for several days. Especially if there is a good watertight seal and no infection. They work great to speed healing and reduce scarring.

  So I‚Äôll give this a five for stick, very impressive. I burned my thumb and got a blister, placed this on finger print area over the blister, I decided after three days, which it was still well adhered, to change it out - the area over the blister itself literally stuck to my injury! I pulled the protective skin from the top of my burn off and it stuck to the bandaid it wasn‚Äôt until I had to detach the stick from my blister that I realized there was no cotton pad to separate stick from non stick! That‚Äôs where my one star comes in. I am now more injured than prior to placing the bandaid, my top skin layer is now gone and I have a more painful and now exposed blister area.

  Where have these been all my life? I had this fissure/slit in the pad of my fingertip & regular bandaids would fall off every time I'd wash my hands or sooner. Even the supposedly waterproof ones.But these are different than a regular bandaid. They have no gauze. They're like a 2nd layer of skin. You put it over the wound & it keeps it clean & slightly moist I guess so healing can occur. Which is also good for minimizing scarring.An added bonus for anyone wishing to bandage a finger with these is that Hydro Seal Band Aids still let you type on your iPhone! I'm typing this review with my bandaged finger. An added bonus to the fact that they stay on nicely through hand washing & bathing!Only improvement I can see would be maybe offering them in more skin tones....

  I had an abscess that was infected. Toward the end of the process of draining I used these to cover the open skin. It‚Äôs super hot out and my infection was near my armpit. This worked so well in covering this hole and keeping it clean. I did change them each day before bed because it was an infection so I wanted to be safe. It covered this wound very well and stayed on. Keep your wound safe and clean and this is perfect!**update**Also, this was wonderful to heal the small hole from the drained abscess. I hate to be gross but if you have this issue it‚Äôs a great idea to use this as a bandaid or gauze can come off so easily.  I bought boxes of these things and it healed my small abscess holes amazingly and didn‚Äôt leak or make me nervous.

  I purchased these because I ended up with a puncture wound from electric drill, going through base of nail bed. After 6 weeks of following Dr.‚Äôs orders & letting it heal, my nail itself started lifting away from nail bed. We were fixin to go on vacay to the beach for 2 weeks & I needed something that would completely seal my finger/nail so I wouldn‚Äôt risk getting anything trapped or risk infection from the one side that was lifting. I followed directions throughly, & applied bandage. I did find that it sealed better if you warmed up band aid first by cupping/or rubbing in hands along with warming hands before applying. Headed down to beach, & not even 3 hours later it was peeling & lifting. I don‚Äôt think these were meant to be used around or in salt water. The only time these actually worked was when we took a day off by not going swimming in the ocean. They are also a beast to remove.....you must be patient & go slow while pulling one end straight from where it sits, & not peeling off like a regular bandaid. They really didn‚Äôt suit my purpose for purchasing, but they may work great for other minor & small injuries that don‚Äôt involve being in/around salt water.

  I had a one inch wound after I fell and scarped my knee on a rough textured tennis court.  I applied these hydrocolloid bandages onto a well-cleaned knee, kept it on for 3-4 days straight (no peeking) and watched how fast the wound healed!  It really works and they're really waterproof!  About one day after I applied these special bandages, the center turned puffy white and that how you know it's working.  I peeled it off my knee and the area looked so good.  No gross scabbing formed.  Just new, fresh skin growing.  I also got a one inch deep cut on my thumb (from those darn tough plastic packaging) and put one of these bandages on my thumb.  Same result after 2-3 days!  I'm a believer!  Great bandages!

  Theee hsve been around for decades and our family has always used this brand. When they began to make the flexible fabric it was helpful and an excellent product for our daughter who is  highly allergic to latex. The size is great and while  it does stick very well to your skin and resistant to pull off of skin  it never hurts. These are a mainstay in our home for any abrasion. Highly recommend this product and this seller too. These are well priced when you cannot find them in most stores and pharmacies and they ship quickly as promised too.

  The are great bandages, especially for bad evasion setting the knee. I needed a bandage that was large enough to cover the would and peirce it while also allowing it to get air and still move. It's a large size that's hard to find but nothing beats these for stretch and protection

  These large bandages adhere well in curves of hand, the adhesive stays where you want it; very flexible, pad doesn't stick to wound.  I would highly recommend them!  They stayed on even after getting a little wet when washing my hands.

  I had a wound to my leg paralleling my shin on the outer aspect, which measured abut 4"" L x 1/2 in W and ~2/16"" deep. No sutures. Need to cover and allow to heal, but ended up needing a skin graft, where the surgery is next week. In the 3 weeks of covering, this was a great non-stick pad as compared to plain gauze.  As the pic shows the construction is such that there is a cotton-like middle layer about 4/16"" thick, which is surrounded by a smooth nylon stocking like mesh. The mesh material does not stick to the wound, though mine was more draining and not draining and drying so much. The cotton-like substance absorbed drainage  well. Much more comfortable than plain gauze which at times felt like sandpaper. You can cut to s smaller size and the cotton-like absorbent does shred or fall out. A positive experience for me, no sticking, no infection (hand sanitizer and Silvadene cream), some healing.... getting me to skin graft next week. Wrapper goes into the compost bin. Btw you have to keep the bandage on with tape.

  This is one of the most brilliant, useful band-aid products. However, even though this item says sold by 'Band-aid' or 'Pharma-pack' it often arrives mysteriously fulfilled by a different 'seller.' It's only annoying because Band-aid and Pharma-pack deliver the product perfectly; whereas, two other sellers have sent products that are damaged or crushed.

  We use these with gauze wraps to protect my husband's legs.  Recently, fluid built up in his legs and leaked through his skin constantly.  That led to open sores over a period of time.  These pads along with the cotton wraps and medication help absorb the fluid and protect the sensitive skin so that it can heal while the fluid is reduced in his legs.  Pads that stick can rip the skin off making the situation worse.  I highly recommend these.

  Hospitals don't carry non stick pads, so if i have a wound or a procedure i make sure to bring my own.  Otherwise they stick regular gauze in the wound,  cover it up,  send you home and then you have to spend 30 minutes to an hr trying to get the gauze that's stuck to your wound off and it can be painful.  3x4 is the best size for covering for us so far.

  I have used both the old version and this current version. While current version has the ability to absorb, the plastic tape wrapper is annoying. And if you have a knee or elbow injury when you bend it, the wrapper moves around and might come off. The old version never stuck to my road rash along with Neosporin. But this has stuck at least once due to wrapper like concept.

  When I read the positive reviews, I thought this was the product for me, but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs flexible, but it barely gets around my finger to overlap on itself. Within an hour, the overlap came apart and it was catching on things. These might work well on small fingers, but certainly is not long enough to get a good overlap on my fingers, which are not particularly large for a man. The overlap on the second band aid is already coming apart and catching on things after about 3 hours and I‚Äôm not using my hands very much. The other band aids I was using before I bought these (CVS brand) were doing a far better job.UPDATE - June 8, 2019I was wrong. I was trying to use these like other cheaper band aids, where you have to wrap them around the finger and overlap them so the adhesive is clinging to the other end of the band aid, but they are designed to cling to skin, not the other end of the band aid. I have since used them for a cut on the tip of my finger. This time I couldn‚Äôt, and didn‚Äôt, overlap. All of the adhesive part of the band aid is on skin. And it sticks wonderfully. The band aid stays on despite a lot of use, including washing hands and dishes. I am really impressed and am now glad I bought these and gave them a further try. These are my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù band aids from now on.

  The claims on the box are major overstatements.  Lasts 12 hours and stands up to light, infrequent hand-washing would be a lot closer to the truth.  You should also be aware that the absorbent pad is thin and occupies somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3 of the pad width.  The bandage itself is thin and stretchy, and does conform nicely to the skin.  The adhesive releases when wet, just like most band-aids.  You also have to be careful not to let the bandage adhere to itself, given how floppy it is.

  I go through a lot of band aids during certain seasons due to the dryness it causes to my hands, causing them to crack. Generally, I look for two things: (1) adhesiveness (good for day to day use without curling, but also not excessively strong that it can pull skin off when removing) and (2) How well it fosters healing.Unfortunately, the Skin Flex band aids fail on both counts:- Adhesiveness: the ends of the bandage frays relatively fast and I generally have to replace after a few hours after moderate activity- Foster Healing: wounds that normally heal after a day with other bandaids are still open after 2-3 days. It's likely due to the very small cotton pad area. Also, since the bandage is thin, you can easily feel the wound through it which is distracting.I do recommend their other product ""Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages Sheer"", which has a larger pad area + the adhesive is good enough to last the day.

  As a chef with Fibromyalgia, I end up with lots of little cuts and burns. You could call me a band-aid expert by now... So far, these have been the ONLY bandages that stand up to the rigors of working with gloves, constant hand washing,  and my general clumsiness. Granted they aren't perfect -no bandage could be- but more often than not these little troopers hold their own!

  I cut myself all the time, totally accident-prone. Plus I make and fix things. Very hard for me to find bandages which have good adhesion and feel comfy. I can't find these locally (and I live in a big metropolitan area). Plus I cannot find anything this reasonably priced. Highly recommended. Matter what you use to cover cuts, keep dry and change daily. I also always used antibiotic ointment, cos I am prone to infections.

  As bandaids are adding different ‚Äúantibacterial‚Äù agents to their products - it makes it hard to buy them without the antibacterial bs ingredient. I don‚Äôt know about others but my skin breaks out in hives with antibacterial agents in bandaids.So finding this was awesome!My two cents to companies adding new stuff to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù - don‚Äôt.  Just regular old fashioned bandages with various sizes are great. If we want to have added antibacterial stuff on our wounds - let us get neosporin or something- but company arbitrarily adding it leaves this customer hunting down products that don‚Äôt have it.Thank you Amazon for carrying this product because stores rarely carry this anymore.

  This is a phenomenal product. I am a nurse, so naturally my Dad asked me to research first aid kits for him to keep in his Jeep for when he goes off-roaring. I was very impressed with the reviews for the M2 Basics, and the amount of supplies it came with. I decided to purchase an additional kit to leave in our family vacation home to have on hand should a need arise. It made it easier for me to feel comfortable getting this for my son in college.I was delighted when after recircing them, I got an email from the company with a pdf of basic first-aid instructions. After reading through and finding it to be helpful to someone without first-aid knowledge, I thought it might be a good idea to print off the pdf, laminate and attach to a keychain to have on hand for anyone in the Jeep or vacation house to use. My Dad was thrilled with the result and the first-aid kits. Thank you for making such an awesome product.My only regret is not getting a kit for myself. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone.

  This is a great first aid kit. It has a good amount of items necessary for an emergency. The ONLY thing I noticed it didn't have was the cohesive tape for the bandages since they're not self adherent. I had to purchase the tape separately and placed 2 in the kit. Other than that, I like the items selected for this particular kit including the Benadryl, Neosporin and a step by step first aid guide booklet. I purchased this kit specifically for my car since I travel from time to time especially when I visit my family out of town. I like the compact plastic case which has a handle for easy carrying. I recommend this first aid kit.

  Yes, you're going to need to buy a roll of medical tape if you have an injury bigger than a regular bandage will cover. This is the 2nd one of these J&J first aid kits that I've bought.Pros - comes ready to go, has a ""basic first aid"" booklet, has assorted wound care wipes, bandaids in common small sizes, even a box of waterproof bandaids, a tube of first aid cream, a tube of antihistamine cream, an instant cold pack, 2 sets of medical gloves, rolled gauze. All in all, a very decent basic first aid kit at a reasonable price. There is more than enough space in this box to add extras if you want them.Cons - Not many, for what it is - a BASIC first aid kit. This will help you if you are home or camping/vacationing and get any number of small cuts/scrapes/stings etc. I like having a pair of tweezers, a pair of scissors, a small tube of aloe vera, a small spray bottle of hand sanitizer, a few folded paper towels in a sandwich bag, a small pocket knife, a tube of lip balm, and a 5 foot length of paracord with a carabineer in my kit, so I add them. Those are just my preferences. Not really cons I guess. Maybe you have other preferences/needs...*Useful tip for saving space in your first aid kit.* Get rid of the unnecessary boxes. A quart-sized zip top bag will hold all of your bandages and gauze. The tubes have all the ""medical facts"" and usage information printed on the tube. You'll find that there's a lot of extra space once you've scaled down the unnecessary packaging.I hope this helps.

  These pads are not the open weave gauze of traditional gauze pads. The ones labeled ""Band-Aid"" are a different composition (which could remind you of thick paper towels) which is more dense and a waffle weave pattern. The Band-Aid varieties come in different sizes and are good for soaking up a lot of fluid from a wound. They are soft and sterile, well-wrapped in individual paper wrappers. A bit of a tendency to stick to wounds.

  They are, um, bandaids.  And Band-Aid brand bandaids.They stick and keep bad stuff out.  But not some air - they breathe; you don't want it getting too nasty underneath.Easy to tear open and apply when you're dripping blood (already tested more than once, I'm afraid - sheesh, we just bought these a month ago!).And they come in a billion shapes.

  I loved the fact that no fibers stuck together and made it hard to wrap around you, much less remove.  I loved the thickness that protected the wound so it wouldn't hurt so much.  And I loved that the adhesive didn't leave any residue that I'd have to scrape and rub off afterward, like some bandages do.

  Package claims that ""adhesive stays in place when wet.""  This is only partially true.  I've used this bandage countless times, so I know.  It definitely stays on *better* than most other bandages.  If you get it wet, unlike other bandages (esp. fabric) it will remain stuck to ITSELF (i.e., where the bandage wraps around and adheres/folds onto itself); however, it won't remain stuck to your SKIN.  It can handle some water, but if you sweat or wash dishes, good luck.  Everything else about it is great; I just wish I didn't have to replace it so often due to moisture.

  I've used Sport Strip bandages for years and love them.  They stay on unlike most bandages and are wider.  I've been unable to find them in any store around where I live so off to Amazon I go!  Received my order quickly and boxes were in good condition.

  The color blends with the skin, and the fabric stretches slightly and conforms to the shape of whichever area the band-aid is applied. The part covering the scrape is slightly padded, so it is protective. Adhesion is very good, which is also a  negative in my case due to very sensitive skin. To remedy this issue, I quickly and repeatedly apply the adhesive part  to other areas of my skin before covering the scrape. It also helps to change the direction of the band-aid each time it is replaced over the same spot.

  I purchased these for work, I work outside in all weather conditions. I likes the larger size, better coverage you know. So today I split my finger up near the cuticle- OUCH!!! So I pulled out my new band-aids. They covered no problem, stuck well but felt really weird to the touch! Kinda a rubbery feeling, the quilting was great far less sticking to the bloody stump. ha ha. I took awhile to get use to the sticky rubbery skin like band-aid, but WOW! I really like these, it stuck on all day through heavy use, although the band-aid got extremely dirty, it never cracked or split from the 101 degree heat index. When I got home and was cringing at the thought of removing it from the dried bloody stump, but it came off not problem, like it lifted the blood from the cut as it dried, no sticking at all. Not sure on others experience with this product, but I'm quite happy to add these to all my first aid kits, and to hand out to my buds at work or the trail. Plus getting two boxes was a great selling point.Bottom line: still a happy Band-aid customer! worth the purchase, great results!

  There was a time when i would give these bandaids 5 stars, but then they changed the way they made them. They still adhere like they're glued on and they're still easy to remove. They were never water resistant. What i used to absolutely love about them is the gauze pad used to go all the way to the edges of the bandages. Now they've made them so that there is a small amount of adhesive on each side and there's less gauze to cover the cut/burn. That was a horrible change. Really bad decision. I guess it saves them money. I can't figure another reason why they'd change it.Still my preference because of the other attributes.

  I am a Band Aid brand guy. I have tried those other ones and the generic brands and IMO none are as good as the Band Aid Tough Strip brand. Unfortunately for me, I get a lot of cuts on my hands. Don't ask me why, I work on a computer for a living. But I do my own auto and home repairs and get my share, and then some, of cuts on my fingers and knuckles, so having a good supply of band aids is kind of a necessity. I have big hands so the 1"" x 3-1/4"" is a perfect size. I have a mixed pack as well, but the majority of the time this is the size and shape I need so it made sense to get a one size box.The stretch fabric allows you to make them work pretty much wherever you might have a cut - and they stay put, even if it's on a knuckle joint that moves. And since they are a thicker material it's much easier to find the edge to remove one. And if you put one on too tight, you can easily find the edge, loosen it up, reapply it and it will still stay stuck. No joke.Now if you're looking for a water proof band aid this might not be a good fit. They are pretty absorbent actually. But for me that is not an issue. If it gets wet I just grab another one. The waterproof band aids don't have the flexibility these do and don't stay on, so it's not a good trade off in my opinion.Can't go wrong with these band aids and you get a lot for the money.

  They have changed the gauze protect peel-off papers. It used to be when you peeled off the first paper, the 2nd had a little fold that you could grab to peel off that 2nd paper. They took away that fold. Now, you have to dig it up with your fingernail and you can't help but get your finger onto the gauze pad so it's not sterile anymore.The gauze pad is also smaller than it was.The bandaid doesn't stick to itself very well either so when you wrap it around your finger, it keeps coming off on the overlap. Sticks ok to skin.

  Normally, these are great. The ones I received were old and useless. They stick to nothing, not my skin or anything else. Of course I didn't need to use one until after the return deadline, and didn't realize I had needed to test them or check whether they would actually stick right when I got them. No quality control or just trying to offload expired inventory happens too often with Amazon.

  I‚Äôve purchased these in the past at Local pharmacies (Walgreens/CVS) and have been very pleased with the band aids.  These that I have purchase on Amazon are probably Chinese knock offs. They start unpeeling/unsticking within 30 minutes of application.  Zero water resistance.  Terrible unraveling/strings-everywhere problem.  Never had these issues with the store bought band aids.  Do not buy!!!

  The Band-Aid Tough Strips are good and durable bandages that can withstand lots of physical movement. The only drawback is that the adhesive on this bandage does not tolerate water. Once the bandage gets wet the adhesive starts to immediately deteriorate and the bandage starts to fall off.

  I have always purchased Bandaid Tough Strips - the adhesive lasts 'forever'.  That means through water, dirt, soap, sweat -- anything.  You have to actively remove it to get it off (usually just easiest to cut it off).  That's what I thought I was getting.  Guess someone decided that we all want the bandaid to come off by itself the minute it gets wet, because that's what happens.  I didn't even get a chance to see how it holds up otherwise.  If I could return a box with one missing, I would certainly do so.  As it is, I guess they're only good to stop a small cut from bleeding, then take it off when the bleeding stops.  Can't think of anything else it would be good for!

  They're pretty good. The only complaint I have is the size of the pad compared to the width of the adhesive band. I mean, it's good that it has a sticky edge all around, I guess. But I liked them better they way they were before when the pad was the same width as the adhesive... now the ""AID"" part seems small compared to the ""BAND,"" but I'll take what I can get. Now I need a bigger BAND-AID that is somewhere between this size and the next one up, which is HUGE.

  Yet, another quality product declining. They used to be the best adhesive strip. These flexible fabric band-aids start to unravel as soon as you put them on. Within 2-3 hours, there were strings, by night the strings were over 1 inch long. I trimmed them, yet they come back by morning. The fabric unravels, creepy. The strings get in the way of everything.

The band-aids themselves are easy to apply, feel good, and most importantly stick well to the skin and are easy to remove without a ton of pain.  The travel box makes it super easy to stick in your bag, in your pocket if needed, and into a suitcase.  The case is easy to open and will last for a long time.

  The first bandaid we took out was awesome so we didn't suspect anything was wrong. There's a reason why this is the best deal though. When you peel the wax paper off the band-aid it peels the adhesive off with it. These band-aids don't stick at all. The box we received must have been soooo old and we found out too late. Dollar store band-aids are better quality and they have a longer shelf life. We've only had our box for like 6 months, in a closet and out of the sunlight.

Its a really nice variety of different types of band-aids and a variety of sizes, although most are standard shape and sizes.  I thought this was an excellent deal and it would be a great buy for a family who goes through band-aids frequently, as I know my family tends to do.

  There are no better band-aids. Keep some on hand for those challenging Banding jobs like at body joints that used to bend. They stay on under compression socks pretty well, too.  These aren't the cheapest, but they are the best.  They stay put.  A solid proof is the cat can't remove them while I sleep (grandkids, somehow capable of being even more annoying than cats, CAN remove them while you sleep).  Other than that, they are Band-Aids.  Likely McGyver could use them to stop a solid fuel booster leak.  Never being accused of McGyver-ishness, I use them to stop challenging blood leaks and as targets for all manner of annoying creatures.

  I ordered the Comfort Sheer Band-Aid but got just ""Sheer"".  The description says that Sheer and Comfort Sheer are the same - but they are not.  Sheer is a plastic wrap around, while Comfort Sheer is more fabric-y with more flexibility.  Don't be fooled by this!  I now have 5 boxes of Band-Aids that I don't want!

  These Band-Aids are kind of a nuisance. They stick fine and cover the cut all right, the problem is when you try to take them off, they shred and you have to pick them off in little bits. Last one was in more than a dozen pieces. Adhesive is much stronger than the material it's on. And if you use them on the bottom of your foot and you're pressing the adhesive all day long, it could take a good ten minutes to unstick all the bits.I expected better from the brand-name bandages. Would not recommend.

  They are Band-Aids for Pete's sake.  Yes, but:- The grandson who loves all things Cars was delighted.  With band-aids!  It even held his attention (for a couple of minutes) on Christmas morning.-  It is the Band-Aid brand band-aid.  Top quality.-  It includes both Lightning McQueen and Cruz Ramirez individual band-aids.-  Lightning McQueen is on one side of the box, Cruz Ramirez on the other side.-  This one stocking stuffer came in a nuclear, ""pharma-pak"" box.  You could stand on the darn thing without damaging the contents inside.- For those concerned about such things (like me), the box was in pristine, undamaged, unblemished condition.It does cost a couple of dollars extra, but given the reasoning above, we found it more than worth the small premium.

  I've been using these for decades in the US Army as a medic.  They make kids smile when you need to put one on when treating civilians and locals over seas.  They also get an unsure, ""Um... thanks doc"" and provide a good visual indication of a ""boo-boo"" when a big tough infantryman asks you for a band-aid on a range.  I've paid for these things out of pocket since I was a private, and it has been worth every penny of it!

However, I went through with the purchase and was given 3 boxes of the bandages in the one package. If they had only sent 1, I‚Äôd be upset. However for 3 at a time, this was a steal! They‚Äôre cute and function well. If you‚Äôre able to find them in person, you might as well buy them at the grocery store.

  I bought these because they're advertised as waterproof and I have an open wound on my hand that I'm supposed to keep dry. They might actually be waterproof if they stayed on when they get wet, but I wouldn't know. Even dry they don't stay in place very well on the hand, maybe on a part of your body that doesn't see much action, they would stay in place better.

  These are the best band-aids ever. They will stay on for days even if they get wet. They are especially great for your hands/fingers that can be tricky to get a band aid to stick when you are working with your hands. I usually have to use a regular band aid then put tape around it to be sure it will stay. Not these! They are staying put until you take them off. Love them!

  These are excellent when wet. They really do stay on if soaked with water. The only downside is that the actual size of the gauze which covers the wound is pretty small. So they are good for small cuts, not good for larger ones.

  First of all, I've come to realize that Band-Aid brand bandages are the standard by which I now measure all others. I bought a huge variety pack of Curad bandages at Costco - it was an amazing amount for around $10, plus or minus - but they are absolute crap with the absorbent pads being misaligned or falling off much of the time. They just feel cheaply made. Band-Aid bandages, however, always seem to be super high quality.Having said that, these clear bandages from Band-Aid are not my favorite material type of theirs. I've come to realize that the ABSOLUTE BEST are the ones called Band-AId Comfort Sheer. I would have reviewed those but I bought the Comfort Sheer locally, not through Amazon like I did with these. The Comfort Sheer material is thin and moves fluidly with your skin no matter on which awkward curves and shapes you place them. They also blend in with (at least my northern European) skin color better than any other bandage I've used.Bottom line: these are nice but Comfort Sheer is the better material, without a doubt.

  Great product overall. Adheres well to clean skin without being so sticky that it pulls your skin nearly off when removed. It's absorbant but not bulky. Good value.Note: Based only on the product images displayed on the packaging, I assumed these would be larger than the finger and toe hydro seal bandages. However, they are very nearly the same size. I admit personal fault, as I could have looked closer but pointing it out for price comparison purposes. This product, the All Purpose version, is only slightly larger than the finger and toes bandages.

  I uses these for a lot, especially blisters. I'm a nurse, and these are essentially a smaller version of the hydrocolloid dressing I use on patients all the time. Once you get them stuck, leave them in place for up to a week and let the healing take place. They are also good for preventing blisters on pressure spots such as ones you might get from a new pair of shoes.

  The sticky glue requires alcohol to remove and that is very painful to wound. The edges still lift,even with all that glue. They work, but I would not use again.

  Works great. Easy to tear along the length to get a very narrow strip if needed for fingers or toes, for example. I use it without an ""underwrap"", and it does not have the ""bonus feature"" of hair removal or skinning.Yes, it is not very sticky, which, I believe, is the way it is intended. It is sticky enough to stick to itself, and you are supposed to wrap it around a number of times to get the desired support. When I want to remove it, I still have difficulties finding where it ends, which means it sticks well enough.The pharmacy brands are all very sticky, pain in the neck to work with, can't rip them well to get a narrower strip, and literally a huge pain to remove.

  No complaints about the performance of the tape, but this was advertised as a 3-pack at $4.68 per roll.  I paid $14.03 and only got one roll.  It took me an hour to resolve it with Amazon and it took a lot of persistence on my part.  I advise looking elsewhere until they get their information straight.

  Johnson & Johnson Sports Tape is now my hands' best friend. I get a lot of blisters from rowing, and the sports tape is a life saver. The tape is sticky enough to stay stuck to my hands as I row, but also not too sticky to agitate my blisters. I, myself, rip off a small strip of tape just big enough to cover my blister and cover it with the non-adhesive side. Around that, I tape on another layer, but directly sticking the tape on is definitely not an aggravating problem. The product is also wonderfully waterproof. I don't have to worry about the tape slipping off when we move the boat from the water to the boathouse. Scissors aren't needed to help protect your hands either, since the tape is nice and easy to rip. It is a little wider in width than necessary, but it's definitely a great product for anyone playing rough-on-hands sports.

  I bought this tape for taping my feet for Plantar Farciitis. When I first started to use it, I was worried that it wouldn't be sticky enough to hold well. It was a little tricky to get the first piece of tape in place(the one that goes around the foot from behind the big toe to the behind the little toe, the piece I think of as the ""anchor""). This piece was falling off a little and I had to stick it back into place and be gentle.. so this made me concerned that this tape just wouldn't work out. But once I had the rest of the tape on, this stuff was perfect. It never came off. It provided excellent support. When I did go to remove it, I was pleased that it left a minimum of tape goo on my foot. When I first learned to do this type of taping I was using some other type of tape that my friend had, and that tape had left a lot of goo on my foot. It was annoying to get off, so I'm pleased to have found tape that doesn't do that but holds and provides support just as well. I've used it several times now and have no complaints.

  I bought some items to round out my first aid kit and bought these because of the name brand and price.About a week later I got my first bout of tendinitis and the only relief I could get was to wrap my wrist with this bandage.  I'm so glad I had it on hand. (pun intended)  I'm buying more to put back in stock.  It pays to have a well stocked kit because you never know when you will need something.  This wrap is well made and provided a perfect grip and stuck without needing clips or tape.

  Maybe I received three boxes of defective Band-aids, but I'm not impressed with them. I like the tough strips but these are very different. The material is very rubbery and therefore sticks to things. For example, I had one of these bandaids on my finger and when I put my hand in my pocket the water block bandaid would grip onto the fabric of my pocket lining and pull the bandaid off. Very annoying and made the bandaid worthless.

  With these, water resistance is achieved both by using a water resistant material, but also by the design that forms an adhesive seal on all four sides of your wound. This also means however that the gauze pad part is smaller and more narrow (look closely at the product picture to see what I mean). So, for the specific case where you have a smaller cut on your finger and are working in an environment where your hands are going to be wet or washed often, these are the right band aid to use, but they are not a replacement for other/everyday band aids. They are more expensive than other band-aid types, and provide less coverage area, flexibility, and breathability. So, we have both a box of these and a box of the flexible kind in our house.

  I really like this type of bandage. It's sort of like mild duct tape. It DOES stick a little too much. When you take it off, it hurts like the dickens! But, that means it also stays on.As far as waterproof.......no such thing with a OTC bandage that I've found. It's better than most, but can't keep the water out if you get in the shower or if you have it on your hand and put your hand in water. It WILL get wet underneath. But, hey. What do you expect?They stay on until  you're ready to take them off. I use them for my fingers, and put finger cots over them to keep them really dry :). Now, there you have 'waterproof'.Anyway, good bandage; a little expensive, but worth it.

  I slice open my hands a fair amount in the summer, and this specific type and brand of band aid seems to work best when subjected to showers or scuba/freediving sessions. They are not perfect, and may need to be replaced daily if in tough/high touch areas, but they still perform better than many alternatives, even within the band aid brand. Rating as 4 stars vs 5 because liquid skin/bandages may outperform for my needs, haven't tried it yet though.

  I LOVED the old Sport Strips from Band-Aid. They ""improved"" them (added cushion care) by making them wash off when you wash your hands.  The old style did not do that and that is why I bought them.  I guess this is to sell more Band-Aids, because you have to replace them multiple times a day (if on your hands).

  Horrendous - Absolutely horrendous.  Bought this ""5-Pack"" and just tried the first ""band-aid"" from it.  These things are nothing like the picture on the box.  The pad is flimsy and thin, and it does NOT feature the raised, thicker portions pictured.  The adhesive ends are similarly flimsy, thin material, and it shreds into many smaller pieces when you attempt to remove the ""band-aid"", such that you're forced to scrape them off your skin one by one.  I've never encountered a ""band-aid"" this laughable in my entire life.  These things are unusable - all 5 boxes are going straight into the trash.I can't believe these are made by Johnson & Johnson.  I think they're just one more cheap Chinese knockoff we're seeing so much of today.  Box says ""Made in Brazil"", but so what?  Would a knock-off artist lie?  Duh... SMHI also question the legitimacy of all the glowing 5-star ""reviews"".  Bogus positive reviews are also becoming more prevalent these days, as scammers try to increase sales by writing positive ""ghost"" reviews.Bottom line: Save your money.  Don't waste it on this product, like I did.

  I don‚Äôt know what J&J did, but improvement is not it. I believed I was buying the previously purchased Sport Strips- they were great; however, these new Sport Strips are absolutely horrible. The old ones lasted through three or more showers; these came off after washing hands. It makes me sad when a product is great and then is no longer available, only to be replaced with a much inferior product. Shame on J&J

  This Band-Aid is excellent...............if you can manage to apply it properly. The material that sticks to skin is very thin. Therefore, if you don't  get it right the first time, the material curls and sticks to itself, and you cannot pull it apart. I found that I needed to throw a few out because of this.

  These are excellent, for a large wound in an area that moves a lot these are great.  Other tapes and bandages would fall off frequently but this stays perfectly in place, even through showers.  They are tough to get off but that's what I was looking for.  Similar adhesion to tough strips but very thin and flexible.  Could not be happier.

  Sizing is a crazy and personal thing but I think these are too large. They have skin flex extra large that are smaller than these. These are labeled covers and not bandages so that may be it. These aren‚Äôt as thin and conforming like the skin flex bandages so mostly effective on flat areas. I like the skin flex material and the adhesive is nice. Not a fan of the wildly fluctuating pricing.

  First of all, the description clearly states 3 boxes.  I received one.  I bought these because I recently had foot surgery and I wanted to cover my stitches while taking a shower.  I had been using the regular tough strips with some success, but I thought the waterproof kind would work better because they were still getting a bit damp.  I am not sure if I had just gotten a bad batch, but the bandaid pretty much fell off of my foot in the shower providing no protection at all.  I was super disappointed, so I just went back to using the regular tough strips at less than a quarter of the price per box.  Maybe it would be better with a different seller, but I won't be paying $10+ again for this one pack of bad bandaids.

Which is rare, as I am obviously purchasing them in boxes of 100.  They stay on fingers about twice as long as most others before requiring replacement.Highly recommended.  They really are great Band-Aids.

  Flexible Fabric is the best Band-Aid bandage out there.  I have a skin disease and am forever bleeding from even small bumps.  I've slapped on every bandage know to mankind.  None even come close to the Flexible Fabric.  Long lasting. Even makes it through many showers.  Highly recommended!!

  I find these cloth bandaids very useful, since they're wide enough to cover almost any casual wound. The adhesive actually sticks well and the cloth part lets the wound heal faster.But don't try to rip them off; you may get black & blue marks because the adhesive is so strong.

  I use this tape for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I use it on my fingers and also as my belt stripes. What makes this tape so good is, it provides great support for my sore finger joints. The tape tears really well length wise to make sure you have the right thickness. The tape does not fray or come unraveled during rolling. The tape stays in place even as your hands get sweaty. When used as a belt stripe the tape stays on your belt even after many washes. Other generic store brand tapes tends to fray with little strings going everywhere, and comes unraveled, or slips off your finger when your hands get sweaty. This is why I only use Johnson and Johnson brand band aid tape.

  I received 5 packages of the tape, but for some strange reason one of them came without the outer cover.  And yes, the other reviews are accurate about the difference in this tape vs the original tape. The original was like cloth, but this new tape is like plastic.  Hard to describe the difference unless you used the original version. Still works ok for what I need (I play golf and use this to tape up 2 specific fingers to prevent calluses), but it‚Äôs not as sticky as the original version.

  IMHO, the quality of these bandaids has declined.  The inside of the bandaid has gotten small, thus barely or not even covering the area it's intended to cover, leaving the cut, bruise, etc., only partially covered.  Furthermore, the entire bandaid has gotten smaller.  Will no longer purchase this product.

  The product performance is great. It would be very helpful if there were a reference color palate to display the product hue in spectrum. It is my understanding that there is a wide verity of color available. It would quite advantageous to have this display available so that band-aids could be ordered in a hue that would offer the least amount of contrast to skin tone. Why have the bandage receive all the attention?

  I purchased these bandages for a rather large wound just above my ankle.  I had reservations since it said the adhesive was strong, and the skin on my leg is rather fragile, but the bandage was not hard to remove.It covered the wound completely and stayed on perfectly even though the wound had some drainage.  When I took it off, it didn't damage the skin at all.  Using this bandage was so much easier than wrapping the leg.  I would highly recommend this bandage.

  Having just tried a competitor's brand, I went running back to these Band-Aid bandages. These work perfectly -- they are thin and unobtrusive, stick incredibly well (even on slightly damp skin, or skin with newly applied lotion), are super flexible, and stay on. They're also easy to remove without trauma.They are not waterproof, but I have showered with these on, and find that they dry fairly quickly, so water doesn't get excessively trapped inside.Despite the product description as of this review (8/15/19) indicating that these bandages are all one size, they actually are not. This is a variety pack, with some very large kneecap sized bandages, a large number of standard sized bandages, some mini ones and some in between.I highly recommend these - won't go back to any other.

  I am a nail picker. Second I feel anxious, I'm picking my thumbs cuticles down to stubs. I have tried everything.I bought these because they are waterproof and they cover the whole tip of the finger so I cannot pick. Like training wheels. It is what it is...I liked that the product could be left on all day even with washing hands. I did not like that some water does sink in leaving that soggy effect and a raisin finger at the end of the day, BUT this can easily be avoided by keeping the finger aeperate and dry. The backing was a bit difficult and while applying I had to make sure it did not stick together and wasted two or three failing at the attempt not to. However, when they do get on properly, they stay on. It would probably help having someone apply them for you.I would recommend these for chefs or other food workers with finger mishaps or other nail biters/pickers.

  It takes a little figuring out how to apply these bandaids.  Remove one side of the backing, apply it, then remove and apply the other side.  This keeps the two sides from getting stuck together.  Press it down well to make sure it seals.  Stays on pretty good, but like any other bandaid, does fall off after about a day.

  You know how you get a cut on your finger, put a bandaid on it but then you have to wash your hands?  The bandaid comes off or gets soggy, right?  Wrong!  These babies work!  They stay on, cover the cut so it can heal and move with your fingers (or any other body part that has a boo-boo). I'm really hard on stuff and not very ""delicate"" but these hold up well.

  First review I've ever written.  As a person who believes in keeping cuts/scrapes covered until healed in order to prevent infection, I LOVE these Band-Aids!  They actually stay on my kids through the whole school day, even after playing outside and washing hands a number of times.  Same for adults.  Plus, they seem to dry pretty quickly.

  My knuckles often need a little help in the winter, and these Bandaids stay all day and don't leave any residue when they are removed.  I just wish I could find them in more sizes.

  I have tried a lot of different bandages over the years and I can't recall any that I liked more than these with the exception being the Advanced Band-aids. I don't however think the Advanced Band-aids are better in every case as both kinds seem to have their place. Comparing these to the advanced Band-aids sometimes I want more airflow over my wound and I think these deliver a bit more airflow. The material sticks well and flexes when stuck on say an area near a finger joint and is very thin. They survive going through the shower and seem to last when put on my kid too. All in all, a product that I highly recommend.

  I think Johnson and Johnson has finally come up with a real winner here, a great sequel to their classic band-aid.  I've tried every single type of band-aid that they've sold.I've tried:- the classic band-aid (great, but not very water-proof, lacks breathability)- sheer comfort band-aid (improves on the classic band-aid comfort-wise, but still not waterproof)- the clear water-proof plus (water-proof, but not too comfortable)- tough-strips (very water-proof, but leaves a sticky mess on your fingers)- advanced active-flex (these are great, but expensive, about 50 cents per band-aid).My testing left we with just too favorites- the classic band-aid, and the advanced active flex (too expensive).  Fortunately, J&J's ultra-strips bridge the gap between the classic and the advanced.  The Ultra-strips have a sheer exterior, but the material is almost fabric-like.  It's very light and breathable, and you can barely feel it on your body.  Moreover, it's very waterproof, and doesn't leave a sticky mess on your fingers.We have a winner here!  Highly recommended!  Grab these the next time you accidentally injure yourself.

  We live in hot and humid Southwest Florida where the plants grow rapidly all year around.  Perhaps they grow a little slower during our ""winter"" period but they still need attention.  Having planted several tropical trees on our 2.75 acres has resulted in healthy and fast growing plants that need trimming every few months.Working in the yard comes with its various problems and I often get stuck or injured when working on the plants that have thorns and brambles as a natural defense.  The main problem though is the blisters that pop up on the back of my heels.  I don't have that problem when wearing sandals but those don't provide any protection against all the yard hazards out there.Having had two left ankle osteotomies where the bone is cut, repositioned, screwed back into place with a new cadaver tendon, has resulted in my feet being somewhat different in shape and size.  That's where the blisters come in.  I can't seem to find a pair of shoes or boots to wear outside that doesn't cause blisters on at least one of my feet.So it makes sense for me to use heavy socks combined with these Extra Large Band-Aids on my heels.  That eliminates the blister problem and my feet are better protected by having thick boots around them.  Thank you Band-Aid.

  While most other band-aids have gone away from having the pad going all the way to the edge of the bandage, these still have this feature.This is great for two reasons.  First, you get a larger pad than you would if it sealed on all four sides as most other band-aids do.  Second, if you have a long wound, you can lay two or more of these together side by side without any adhesive separating the pads.I also love the entire fabric band-aid line.  Not only are they tough - which also makes them easier to take off since they don't tear, but the adhesive used is the only thing other than paper tape that I don't get a rash from.I can't say if the adhesive is generally hypoallergenic or if it's just me, but these are the only band-aids that I can use without severe irritation.

  I use a lot of bandaids because I like to cover any open wounds so they heal faster.  I have sensitive skin and also exzema outbreaks so i like these larger bandaids to cover any breakouts.  They stick well but are not too sticky, are easy to remove in the shower or by using alcohol to remove them.  I also use them as a padding for a large callous I have on the ball of one foot.  They will stay on for several days and thru a shower if you need them to.  The pad won't stick to wounds.  The bandage part is flexible and you can stretch it if you need to put some pressure on the wound as well.  The quantity is as described and same bandaid brand as I get in the store.

  I've had cellulitis on both legs off and on for about seven years and once in awhile I will get large open sores that require the larger bandages.  These Bandaids work really well in covering most of them and they are very easy to open and apply.  However, some older folks (and I am getting to that age) have thin skin.  These Bandaids adhere wonderfully to skin, but will sometimes tear the skin if it is too thin.

I expected that at least SOME of the boxes would be that version, but instead all six were the Cars 3 edition.

  These looked likr exactly what I was looking for.  I wonder if this is a discontinued product.  They tear apart very easily.  I needed them for the soles of my feet. It's pretty hard to get them off in one piece. I bought several boxes and I don't think I'll keep using them.

  The ""handy"" case that comes with these Band-Aids is fairly useless but it's not the fault of the box. The box has spaces for each of the types of Band-Aids (except the large ones) but once you put them in the box, you can't tell them apart. The individual Band-Aids don't have any labeling to tell you which kinds they are so once they're removed from their original boxes, the only real way to tell which is which is to open them and hope you get the correct one.

  I got these for 80 Day obsession in 5'2 130 lbs and they are constantly rolling never had them not roll. So sad, just buy the beach body ones and save your money. It is very uncomfortable when they roll and I would rather focus on my workout instead of the rolling band.

  All of the bands have broken.  They all break at the spot where they join the band to make a loop.In general the bands have a good amount of resistance and the 5 included are a good mix from lowest to highest resistance. I have been using them for IT Band rehab for the past few months, starting with the lowest resistance. But after a few weeks of use they stretch at the joint and then break. I just move up to the next higher resistance and, however they are all broken now.If you do buy these don't expect them to last long.

  I have had these bands for several weeks, I use them daily, and thus far they have been perfect. I had never really integrated resistance band exercises into my routine but I am glad i did. These bands are great for a bunch of very effective workouts on your upper and lower body. I wasn‚Äôt sure how best to use them but luckily they come with a very straightforward pamphlet that covers a bunch of great excercises. The carrying case is also a nice plus because without it they would add clutter for sure. I definitely recommend! Edit: unfortunately after a month or so my heavy has ripped...so not quite as durable as I had hoped.

  Horrible quality. Super flimsy and no resistance worth trying to work out with unless possibly for an elderly person, but they fold/roll immediately. I unpackaged and bypassed to x heavy black band as all others were not worth trying. As soon as I put on and did one m9ve it folded as shown in picture. Bummer... would rate 0 if I could. I don't even work out much, was hoping to at home with these.

  I really just wanted bands to help with form and resistance while doing leg press, but with the WAP release of Cardi B, I felt undying need of making the booty pop. I wanted something that would be twerk worthy, but science said that most of that is genetics. I could gain more weight, but that would probably go straight to the tummy and make it stick out farther than my breasts. At least these bands help my booty workout, so someday you'll be able to bounce a quarter off it.

  The rubber in these bands is great quality and very durable. I purchased another brand before these and it was much thinner and I stretched it out in a matter of a few months.  I feel like the thicker gauge rubber will make these last much longer!  Plus, for a little more money I got a variety pack of band strengths and the other brand I purchased I only got one band!

  These look great, and come with a wonderful little carrying case, so I‚Äôm giving them 3 stars. But I‚Äôm sending them back because they‚Äôre 2-3‚Äù longer than the GoFit bands I already have, and just way too big for me.  (I ordered more because the GoFits came in a set of 3 and I want a heavier band to go with them.)  My trainer suggested I buy these because she has them and loves them, but she said the ones I received are longer than hers as well, and, in her opinion, would only fit someone obese. And that‚Äôs not me.

  These bands are good quality and the variety of difficulty in stretching is great (i.e. five different strengths vs. three). I did find the two lighter strength bands rolled a bit on my calves when I was wearing workout tights but I believe this is because they are a lighter weight rubber, and I found this brand to be much better at staying put than others I have tried. Would definitely recommend!

I like the fact that there are 5 different bands, so I can pick the right one for the job. I'd recommend these to anyone wanting to use resistance bands for their workout. I've even kept one around my ankles while I walk through my house. I look goofy, for sure, but it's a good leg workout!

  I noted that reviewers for sets of 5 bands advertised on Amazon often said they found the low resistance bands in their sets to be worthless. I'm hardly an athlete at age 66, but wanted some bands for home PT exercise that would have moderate resistance. These have good thickness and seem durable.

  I have had the ""lighter"" fit simplify bands for two years now but I had forgotten about them until the sheltering in place began.  I broke them them out again and began using them regularly but I needed more for my legs which are very strong.  I am not a gym rat and I don't have a ""hard"" body by any standards but I want to maintain strength and in my old age and this is a good way to do it.  Also my house is small and I don't have room or even want to have room to store  fitness equipment.  The fitness bands allow me to incorporate a little something different into my routines and I can feel the difference.  Although there is a nice booklet with pictures that come with the bands, there are also demos on You Tube which were very helpful.  They are also comfortable to use and seem very durable.  Good value for the money I think.

  l could do a few pull ups already but I wanted to be able to get through the shoulder and upper body P90X workouts without having to skip the later rounds of pull ups. I'm a little north of 200lb and the red band provides just enough boost to get up without making me feel like its doing all the work for me. I can already do a few extra pull ups without the help of the band and I've only had it for a couple weeks.For reference, I could do 4 or 5 standard width pull ups (not chin ups) without the band. With it, I can do around 8.It feels like when used properly, it will be a nice durable band.

  I bought these bands for my 14-year-old son. After reading other reviews, I chose the red bands. My son uses them to assist with pull-ups, dips, and chin ups primarily.  The video provided gave him some other ideas such as tricep extensions and lat pull downs. The red bands were the right choice to allow higher reps 12-16. We will gradually add more bands, lower and higher resistance, and use them as my son grows and gets stronger. Not a big fan of traditional weight training until you are older and more physically developed. These bands are the perfect start to body weight based strength training.

  I have been on a physical therapy program for my shoulder.  This does require me to do a resistance band exercise where they had me simply slam the band into the door.  I was looking for a better solution and saw this.Right after I ordered this, my spouse said that he had something like this from when he was in physical therapy a few years back.  I tried the one he had and it was so thick that I couldn't get the door to close completely.  I was worried that this would be no better when it arrived.This came, I gave it a try and it worked perfectly.  The part that goes by the door is a single layer and no problem shutting the door with this in place.  It holds securely.  This has a larger disc on the one end so it absolutely cannot pull through the door.  Just an extra layer of security.I've used resistance tubes and with wider resistance bands.  It can easily accommodate them all.  Something so simple works so well.

  Great device for pull-up assist. I weigh 215 lb and the green band is good for me. Be very careful with the mount/attachment point. I did not loop around the bar, but instead, attached through a short length of climbing rope and a carabiner. Also use caution when stepping onto band and standing; don‚Äôt want the band to shoot out from under your shoe. I use one foot on the band, and use the other foot (with workout shoes on), to find a balance point. Happy with this ‚Äúhelper‚Äù band and technique. Want to do pull-ups again? Try this band.

  This Fit Simplify  band snapped after just 4 days of using it. I‚Äôve had similar thick green bands from a different company (Canway) that have lasted for years. Definitely made with poor material.

  I just got it today and thought it was long with a handle on the bottom. It's essentially a super thick, giant rubber band. It works for pull up support but I was looking for something different.

  The anti-skid nature of the silicone makes it grippy and a bit painful to get on and off, but I presume this is true for every silicone swimming cap.It left empty space at the top and pulling it lower would have created an awkward fit around my face and back of head.

  I had been using magazine covers and towels as sliders for my Zoom training class, but both would get caught on a tile or stopped on carpet. I bought these because I was worried about hurting myself when the covers or the towel got caught on the carpet or our tile basement floor.  These sliders are working much better - they have one fabric/felt side for floors, and a smooth plastic side for carpets. I‚Äôve had no problems with either surface, and these sliders have eliminated my earlier concerns about hurting myself.

  Reduced to $7.99 then another $1 off coupon, free Amazon Prime shipping and no sales tax makes for a bargain price for this 2"" wide roll that's over 16' long.  It's available in precut or uncut and I got the nude color which is nice.  It's water resistant and stays on even during big sweat!  It's also latex free for those with that allergy.  It stretches as you apply it then tries to constrict which gives support.  I use it on a torn rotator cuff on shoulder and it helps a lot just with everyday use of my arm.  The adhesive is removable with hot soapy water.  Happy with the purchase and the seller and recommend this sports tape.

  I can't get the tape off my feet. I shower every day, and I don't like putting wet tape in my shoes! I would rather do a fresh taping every morning. This stuff, I soak in rubbing alcohol to get off, but the glue stays on my feet, and nothing gets it off. More rubbing alcohol, baby oil, soap.... doesn't work. I used the last of my rock tape on one foot and this on the other. This stuff felt like it was giving better results at first, but by the end of the day, the rock tape held up and had given me longer support.

Ordered this tape last minute for my birthday outfit and my breast looked phenomenal. I have 36E so I was doubtful that it would be able to give me the appearance I was going for. Not only did it do that, but I got so many compliments from other women on how the girls were looking. I told my Mom, my Tias (Aunts) and all my girlfriends this tape is the truth! I am so so so so happy. Not to mention, I have sensitive skin & I did the recommended 24 hour test previous to wearing it and not one irritation.

  Listen...sometimes the DD girls need a little help in a halter dress that a strapless bra shows too much in. Boob tape is much better than the packing tape I have used before. Haha.

  It's not a miracle worker but I like it and it does the job. Initially I didn't think that this thin lil stretchy elastic like sticky material could hold up these flapjack titties of mine...but apparently this lil tape is a keeper.True..it doesn't make them look like I have on a bra BUT It does make them lift enough to look neater and allow a lil more confidence in wearing tube dress or dresses that won't allow a bra.I really like this product...

  The good thing is this product has extra adhesive power. Not comfortable and would need lots of practice to get this on correct. A bit painful to remove and if I tried again, I would use oil to remove next time as suggested. Not easy to work with and will not purchase this again.

  The boob tape and the nipple covers work better than any strapless bra I ever bought. I love them. It keeps me up all day and never came off. They work as intended. Although.... like other reviews it is hard to take off and painful BUT if you simply follow the instructions like many others probably didn't. Hover over a sink and keep splashing HOT water on the tape and it will come off easily. It will leave ur skin red but it will go away in time. I slept through it and my skin isn't red anymore. I love these tapes. Depending on skin sensitivity I wouldn't recommend wearing back to back due to so much adhesion.

  I wore this under my low cut dress last night and it worked better than a lot of other ones I‚Äôve tried before.  Since I got my implants my nips kind of have a mind of their own and like to poke out at random times, even when it‚Äôs not cold lol.  But the petals and tape totally conceals it and keeps everything under control.  It also helps to create nice perky cleavage.  Removal is easy and painless!

  I love the that the tape is fabric-like. That means that it doesn‚Äôt get a stiff, crinkly look/feel  from it curving around the breast, chest or shoulder, and it‚Äôs breathable so I don‚Äôt get sweaty and loose stickiness if the tape. There are measurements on the back so it‚Äôs easy to make sure you always get the right length for the area of the breast that you‚Äôre taping. Tape daily and my only complaint about the tape is that there is only enough in the roll for about 4 uses. Paying this much per yard of tape is not practical when it is a daily thing. I will have to find a less expensive option of something similar or go back to using gaffing tape :*(I have large, sensitive areolas, where were slightly bigger than the size of the pasties, so those did not work well for me. The least painful way I found to take them off was getting into the shower and slowly peeling it off after it was thoroughly soaked. This is after I using coconut oil to get the first off didn‚Äôt work (three days later and I still have a red shape on my areola in the shape of the flower pastie and still hurt to have a t-shirt on).

  I was skeptical about purchasing this product because some of the reviewers mentioned adhesion problems, and I've had bad experiences in the past where the petals took off skin. However, this tape works perfectly! I used to be able to just use the petals but now I need tape, and bought it for a specific thin white top. I was afraid that the tape would somehow be visible, but it blends in well and there is no visible line under the top! It was comfortable, held up well, and did NOT cause any problems for my skin.  I'm so surprised with how well this works that now I will be using this tape more regularly, even with outfits that don't require it.

  So I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I bought this. I was afraid my breasts were too heavy for this to stick. Girl, was I wrong. I'm a 34F/DDD and this tape held up. It even held when I restuck to reposition for  more natural look. I even wore to bed and it didn't shift. I will look for tips on different ways to reposition based on the outfit I'm wearing but I will definitely buy again. Now if you could make in different tones so many ladies and gents can wear their own version of nude, that would be a gamechanger.

  Hypoallergenic, soft and comfortable. It has a strong adhesion and do not fall off easily and waterproof. Flesh tan color, very thin so it isn't easy to detect. Perfect for strapless dresses, t-shirts, halter tops, wedding gowns. Using it as the sports tape, you can also protect your muscle tissue during exercise too.

  So first I had doubts that this thing would work. Got the package and was a little apprehensive about the tape being so thin that it would do a good job. With the first piece my boob was basically in place. I just had to adjust to the bottom for more lift. It stayed in place all night no peeling whatsoever. The tape is pretty stretchy so you don‚Äôt need a lot. Underestimate the length you need and it‚Äôll stretch to exactly where it needs to go. I wasted a lot of precious pieces on my first try ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Tip: don‚Äôt remove the paper all at once, you‚Äôll end up with loads of rolled up tape you can‚Äôt use. As you position the tape over your breast, gently remove the protective paper.My only complaint but more so on my part, I fell asleep with the tape on after a night of partying and woke up with some skin irritation. I removed the tape too quickly and a piece of my skin came off...ouch. I‚Äôd recommend removing immediately when you get home and maybe some baby oil to lubricate your skin so you don‚Äôt get bruises when taking them off. Definitely ordering another roll though.

  ¬†My 43rd birthday outfit was one that I could not wear a bra. When I tell you I danced all night sweat and all and never was worried or felt insecure. This tape is the bomb. I wear 38DD bra. This adhesive holds great! This was my 1st experience with a product like this.

  Wow! Did these things work! There is a little bit of a learning curve on the best way to use them for what you want to do, but it is very worth it! I am a G and I never expected to actually be able to tape up my breasts but this tape made it possible.

  I wear a 34J and this tape held me up very well! If your breast are as large as mine you will need assistance to hold your boob in place/tape. I suggest cleaning your skin and not applying any lotion/oil and tape accordingly. If it‚Äôs your first time trying boob tape get 2 because I made a few mistakes the first time and some parts of the tape would not re-stick. When removing it you hold you skin down and move your hand in the direction of tape removal... DO IT SLOWLY!!!  Or you will tear/irritate your skin. I honestly love this product definitely will buy again!

  Edited to add: if you think it isn‚Äôt working for you look up good lines for tutorials on how to apply. At first I didn‚Äôt know how but once I figured it out it seriously holds well. Added a photo for proof!!I have 48J boobs... and this product is amazing. I started looking into breast tape for my wedding in June and started with good lines. I found this and decided to try because it‚Äôs much cheaper and now that I‚Äôve used both (good lines then this then good lines again) I‚Äôll say this is so much better. I think it‚Äôs probably more adhesive (I even got the extra hold from good lines) and I think this stuck to me a lot more. With that being said, it‚Äôs an absolute must to saturate with oil before removing because it does not want to budge. And I‚Äôd advise in investing in disposable nipple covers because mine got saturated in oil when I was removing the tape and I can‚Äôt get it out lol. I sat in the tub and saturated with baby oil and gradually took them off when the adhesive started to lift.

  40 B cup not big whatsoever. The stretch was great but once you put the tape down you have to be 100% sure that‚Äôs where you want it. It you take it off it loses ALL stickiness. Held them up pretty well! Hurt a bit when taking the tape off when it was over my stretch marks. Other than that the pain was mild. Couldn‚Äôt see the lines of the tape and I was wearing a silk blouse! Good about in each roll. Nipple covers were good for big nips! I loved the little book with ways to use it. I would round the corners of the tape when cutting it can get pokey. The tape is pretty flexible though when moving (:

  The adhesive scarred and burned my skin on both shoulders and on both sides of my chest! I now have to make an appointment with a dermatologist. I used this for my birthday and am devastated about what has happened to my skin. Note: NO, I do not have sensitive skin!! It did hold my breast up and has stretch but was hard to remove so this was the end result...damaged skin!

  Let‚Äôs give it up for the boob tape!!!! I am so super excited to FINALLY find a product that gives my boobs some lift and shape without an uncomfortable bra on, and to be able to wear many types of tops and dresses that I couldn‚Äôt before! I tried the tape as soon as I got it. It wasn‚Äôt very difficult to put on. It didn‚Äôt take me very long at all. I love the brown color of the tape. Though darker than my skin I like it way more than the ‚Äúnude‚Äù color. I haven‚Äôt yet seen how it will hold up to time and sweat. I just wore it around the house for a few hours. I pray that it holds up to salsa dancing with my boyfriend that I am planning on doing in a scantily top in a few weeks, but right now I am SUPER excited about this tape. For reference. My girls are pendulous, tear drop shaped after having kids and losing a lot of weight. This tape makes them perky and makes me feel super sexy. If your boobs are like mine you will LOVE and appreciate this tape.

  This product works too well. It gave a great lift and appearance, & my friend and I wore it on a night out; however when taking the tape off carefully, it ripped not only mine but my friends skin off. I have scars all over my boobs and so does she‚Äîmy skin has been raw for days. DO NOT use this product if you are unaware of the risks from the adhesive or tape. DO NOT use this product if you have sensitive or delicate skin. Although this product works, I am giving it a 1 star review due to the injury it caused for both of us.

  Works pretty good and stays all day. I am not new to using kinesiology tape. I am new to using it for my boobs though. I usually use it for my ankle and knee to help with support. The stuff works wonders. Kinesiology tape has a stretch to it. This one is about 3"" wide. My sports ones are 2"" or 4"" wide. The box it came in was damaged and opened. The pasties were laying in the Amazon package. They were individually wrapped so it wasn't a big deal.It took me a little bit to figure out how to apply correctly and make sure my boobs were symmetrical. I highly recommend watching some you tube videos. I found a one that showed someone applying the tape (and not just talking about it and showing pictures)Tips:‚Ä¢ don't forget to put the pasties on before the tape. Your nipples will thank you.‚Ä¢ round the corners of the tape to help it from accidently catching on clothes and coming up‚Ä¢ take 2"" off the paper backing to start and take the rest of the backing off as you apply. This will help prevent it from sticking to itself.  (Just pretend you are ripping the tape. The paper backing will rip and the tape won't)‚Ä¢ if you are having trouble getting the paper off the tape, stretch the tape a little. The paper comes right up.‚Ä¢ for the first 2 inches and last 2 inches don't stretch. Just apply‚Ä¢ for the rest I would only stretch up to 25%.‚Ä¢ rub the tape for 30 seconds after it is applied. This should help the adhesion stick to the skin better.

  I ordered this to where under some of my bras in order to get a better lift. He receive a decent sized roll of tape and pasties with instructions. Another reviewer explains how to use this the best way. You want to make sure you know what you are doing, because once you put the tape down that's where it needs to be. If you need to adjust it after it is stuck then you will need to remove it and throw it away since the stick will not be very strong after. Make sure you apply the pasties otherwise your nips aren't going to be very happy. The instructions has pictures of different options on how you can use this, but you can look online and see what other women are doing. Make sure you take your time because if you take the backing off the tape right away it could cling to the other side and you will be wasting it again. There is a learning curve with this so you will want to practice. Each end of the tape you won't be stretching and just push it down real well where you're going to have it and then the middle portion will be stretched to get your lift. The tape is pretty thick, so some of the options may not work for certain tops or dresses otherwise you will see it. One way I learned long ago is to basically lean over like you are touching your knees and tape them when they are like that. Back in the day we used to use duct tape lol. Overall, this works and it's nice to have but like I said you are going to want to practice or research it so you don't go through all the tape. It's a decent price, though, If that happens to you around $12.

  I think this tape can be amazing if you put it on correctly the first time. If it's not done correctly the first time and you have to redo it. Then the adhesive would not be as strong. I have some pretty big knockers and it held them up without me putting the tape all the way up to my shoulder blade. It holds up strongly all day while I walk around for extended period of time when shopping / outing with my friends. It's pretty unnoticeable when worn. Can make them babies looked fantastic without a boob job?

  This tape is almost identical to the Kinesiology sports tape that I have used for knee support. One major difference is that it is three inches wide instead of the usual two inches for the Kinesiology tape. The advantage is that the same length of tape provides additional support as a result of the additional width. The adhesive on this tape appears to be weaker than the average, but it will work.

  I‚Äôve got boobs the size of medium watermelons, G cups...to say I was SKEPTICAL is underplaying it. BUT, dang! I got the tape for a Halloween wedding, I wore a plunging v neck dress and ya girl didn‚Äôt need her 6 kids breastfeeding boobs flapping out and ruining the party or just like falling to my knees!  So I got this tape with minimal hope when it arrived looking like an ace bandage and some pasties and I was so wrong! The flower nipple covers are plush, perfect for hiding even the MOST aggressive nips, the adhesive for the flower itself would be great alone for a smaller chested lady! Now the tape, that stuff is MAGIC, it‚Äôs stretchy so you don‚Äôt lose natural movements and it‚Äôs also perfect for keeping your curves and not squaring you off. A little goes a LONG way because of the stretch so from under boob to shoulder you need a lot less than you think if you want to haul those chachas up! I got drunk, I got sweaty, danced, jumped and all the fun things...stayed til I made a conscious and valiant effort to remove. I will say I had some abrasion from the tape but I also have super sensitive skin. 10/10 recommended

  I have huge boobs and it‚Äôs a blessing and a curse. I struggle to find tape strong enough to hold them up right without peeling off from sweat and without it hurting like crazy when you peel it off or leaving residue. Well ladies, this tape holds EM up really nicely, can withstand the heat, and removes easily without leaving any residue. I will say though, removing the tape from your nipple does hurt a bit (maybe I‚Äôm just too sensitive), so I would cover your nipples and then tape over them. But I recommend this tape for sure! It almost looks like a tube top on me lol.

  This is my second order for this boobie tape. I am a 42 yo woman, size 14 with D cups.  I would definitely recommend and plan on ordering again.A few key notes to consider:Pros:- Strong adhesive- Tape is very stretchy and flexible- Used 3 strips for excellent hold; 2 strips for good hold- Used enough tape to go about an inch under my boob to about an inch over my shoulder- Used the nipple petals and they are comfortable. They have a sticky adhesive but it's not super strong so  doesn't hurt to take off. - Lines on the back of tape so you know exactly how long to cut for each strip to be even - Held up to dancing and a night on the town (6-8 hours) Could definitely go longer. - Does not hurt to remove. It's not completely painless but it's easy. Like a band-aid.Cons: - Leaves a slight sticky residue after removal - I was able to get 4 uses out of the roll. Again, I have D cups and each strip was long enough to cover about an  inch under my boob to around an inch over my shoulder. I used 2-3 strips per boob per use. Make sure you  order more than 1 if you plan on using often. - This isn't really a con but you have to be very careful when applying. The adhesive is very sticky and if you  peel the back of the tape too fast or don't apply slowly, the tape stretches so it will retract and expand,  sticking to itself.

  This tape is amazing!! I have a large bust and opt to wear a bra with everything. Needless to say; not wearing a bra was freeing. I advise a practice run before going out because the process is a little frustrating at first. I wore the tape in 100 degree Texas heat during an outside wedding and it didn‚Äôt budge. The removal process requires patients. I used baby oil. Stand in the bath tub and completely saturate the tape with the baby oil and let sit for about five minutes. When pulling the tape off, firmly hold your skin and gently pull the tape away from the skin. It‚Äôs a process but I think it‚Äôs worth it. Five stars for sure!!

  Looks good and fits well . I like that I can change the look depending on my mood or the season. I started to get a little skin irritation after wearing it all the time. I might just have a sensitivity to silicone. I would suggest taking it off from time to time if this happens to you. I liked the small zippers leather pouch that the rings come in.

  I'm a 8 handicap and was looking to buy some balls that I didn't mind playing when practicing and or when the drives are not going great.  I've used other cheap balls and other than around the green I can't tell much difference than the premium balls.  This one just lacks in all areas to me.And I'm not sure why it carries the ""distance"" logo.  I hit my normal ball at least 10-15 yards further than this hard ball plus it is pretty bad around the green.  It will stop with a lob wedge on soft greens like Bent, but on hard Bermuda greens, good luck.So for me, I definitely will not buy again even if cheap.  I bought two dozen and gave the last dozen away.

  First off, full disclosure--I'm not an experienced golfer, by most standards.  I've been playing for less than a decade.  As such, I can't say how many flaws there are in this ball's performance, because there's enough in my own game to make it impossible to know when a bad shot might be due to an inferior ball.  That said...I lose golf balls.  A LOT.  So it's not worth it to me to pay the premium price for the top-of-the-line balls out on the market, even when I can find them on sale.  So price was a major factor in my decision to buy these in the first place.  The other was the color...I'm slightly colorblind, so I lose white golf balls FAR too often...they get out about 150 yards or so and I just can't see them anymore, most of the time.There are cheaper balls on the market.  I know, I've tried them.  I like the feel of these better...I feel like I get better response off the club and better ball flight out of these than anything else I've tried in this end of the market (after playing these, the other, cheaper golf balls that I used to play with feel like I'm hitting wooden balls or small rocks by comparison).  And the color is immensely helpful to me in my game...these are not just yellow balls, this shade of yellow stands out more than most for me and makes it a lot easier for me to track my shots and find my ball.  I get comparable results from these that people I've golfed with are getting from upscale, premium-priced balls, so I'm really pleased with them, overall.My only complaint is, they aren't very durable.  Pretty much any time I end up in the sand with one of them, that ball has a permanent scuff from the shot to get back out (the one place where the cheaper balls I've played with hold up better).  But I typically wind up losing a scuffed ball a few shots later, anyway, so it's not like that scuff mark gets a lasting chance to mess up my game.I don't see myself changing to a new brand anytime soon.  Golf is already an expensive game.  Finding affordable, reliable golf balls helps a lot to keep it viable as a pastime.

  For the price point this is one of the best balls I have played. It's not a solid rock like Top Flite and other comparable  balls in this very low price range. Moderate spin and control around the greens with wedges. However it is a little lack luster when it comes to it's durability. Although if your looking at this price point durability generally isn't your concern.I would recommend this ball to anyone who is graduating from using batches of used balls and is looking for a more consistent feel to start lowering their scores further. However if your a ball snob lets be honest here, stop comparing  a 15$ value pack of balls to your 50$ pro V1's and giving them a 1 star review. These balls are great for the $$$$

  So, I head down to the park almost every day with my Labrador and hit golf balls.  I usually take an ""A"" wedge, good for about 90 yards for me.  I decided to take one of these new balls with me, and grabbed about 8 other balls and headed on out.  I hit the eight balls.  Typical distance.  I thought, well I don't think I'm going to lose it, and I dropped this one on the turf.  As soon as I hit it I'm like What? It just flew further.  About 5 yards.  I thought well this is an anomaly, and I did it again, same result.  This ball was further by about 4 yards.  I thought, well, let me do this one more time, and try to hit my other balls harder.  This time this ball about about 10 yards further, into the woods.  I had to go back with a ball retriever to get it, because my Labrador was right next to it and wouldn't get it.  Anyway, long ball.  I can't speak to how it is around the green.  I *suspect* it will be a little too hard. But not sure.  Anyway, for the price, and the distance, this is a no brainer.  Have fun.

  There are the best balls 99% of people could play with.  Forget the Pro V I or anything else that runs $40-50 a dozen and makes you want to cry when you put it in the water or deep woods.  I thought the Noodle was a joke ball when I first found one but threw it in my bag.  When I started playing it I couldn't believe how well it did on the greens.  It's a soft feel and I love it.  On the tee, my longest drives were with a Noodle and they're great off your irons.  I'm completely sold on these balls.  Excellent playability for the vast majority of us and at a price you won't even think about if you lose one (other then what it does to your score).  I highly recommend a Noodle.

  The glove worked great through one round of golf. I didn't see any durability concerns with it, and the perforated palm definitely helped with reducing hand sweat feel, but I didn't feel it as much as I expected while actually playing which was a pleasant surprise.I did take off one star for durability because I noticed some threads on the back side of the glove looked a bit loose, and a perforated palm is always going to be less durable than a solid palm, but that's the tradeoff for a bit cooler hand.

  I buy several of these gloves at a time through Amazon. My pro shop often skips the cadet large size for some reason, yet they are usually available here. The fit is consistent for me, and the durability of the gloves are perfectly fine for my style and amount of play (four rounds per week and lots of practice balls).One star off because the feel is not as good ""fine"" as some of the premium gloves, but I am very satisfied with the trade offs as outlined above.

  A little disappointed as this glove has basically disintegrated in 6 weeks since purchase. The palm has worn very quickly and the stitching on the rear (next to taylormade logo) has started to unravel. Add to that the spandex/Lycra material running (that‚Äôs the term my wife told me to use to describe the lines that have appeared on this panel). I‚Äôm going to order another on the hole that this is a one off as I‚Äôve had great experience with taylormade gloves in the past.

  Discovered this when I needed a glove while golfing on vacation at Sandals in Jamaica.  Early May, I kept it on almost all during the round & it never got slimy or damp.  Buy it now all the time for South FL golf.

  Playing for the last 23 years I've gone through a lot of gloves and I sweat if my hands even see a glove. While I wish there was more mesh in the fingers the back does allow for some breathability.

  The glove pictured (I now know the hard way) is the RBZ Tech glove which is thicker leather and has the reinforcement patch on the palm.  That is not what you are buying here. You will instead receive a thinner leather glove with tiny ventilation holes all over and WITHOUT the reinforcement on the palm.  It‚Äôs a decent enough glove for the price so I‚Äôll keep it but it is by no means the more durable version pictured in the ad.  I play over a hundred rounds per year and spend probably another hundred hours practicing on the range and this is the type of glove that will last 2 or 3 rounds at the most and maybe 4 or 5 buckets before it wears through at the palm or tears at a pressure point.

  My husband has been using Callaway gloves for a few years now but when this arrived he said this is definitely a big improvement and he will be switching to these TaylorMade gloves.There are several things that he really likes but the main thing is the placement of the velcro closure is on he top of his wrist above where his palm is rather than at his wrist. On this old pair, the velcro was right where his watch was and it would rub and get in the way. Also, these are a bit shorter in the wrist so they don‚Äôt go the whole way up to where he wears his watch, which he prefers.He orders up a size in gloves (often will wear size L for winter gloves but buys XL in golf gloves so that his fingers go the whole way to the end). After wearing these a bit, they did not stretch out and become too loose in the fingers.Even though these are half-synthetic, half-leather leather, they feel soft and supple. The addition of Lycra makes them stretchy. They have a lot of venting in them from big holes on top of fingers to small ones on the underside. It helps with airflow (all golf gloves seem to get a little sweaty but these don‚Äôt make your hand feel like you‚Äôre in a sauna). The construction of these gloves is good - double stitching, no missed stitches.The gloves work well as far as allowing him to feel like he has good grip on his clubs.Overall, these are his new favorite gloves. Really love the way this closes shut so it doesn‚Äôt bother his wrist.

  The thin, soft material of this glove feels good on my hand and securely grips the club even when a little wet.  I should have probably ordered the XXL size because this glove is a little snug.  Even so, it did stretch enough to make for a comfortable fit.  Many of the seams are double-stitched and TaylorMade quality has yet to disappoint me.  I expect this glove to last and continue to add to my enjoyment of the game.

  I can wear either large or extra large in golf gloves. The Stratus glove is a bit tight for me even wearing the extra- large. One problem is that when the fingers are extended to the end of the glove/finger end, there is some stitching that is bunched up between the fingers. At times I found this a bit uncomfortable. This would not be my first choice in a glove for my hand.
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,2021 Stratus Soft Glove,$15.99,5.0,"
  I love the feel of the glove, it does feel soft. I wear XL and these are slight tight where my fingers reach the ends but not all the way back into the joint between fingers. Also slight short on the wrist. Usually a glove will stretch out a bit after use and be a perfect fit.

There is no reason for me to waste money on harder, more expensive balls that I'll probably lose since I lose a sleeve or 2 every time I play. They are VERY soft. They do well with long range but it is kind of hard for me to judge my putting because they're so soft. Liked the ProV1s for putting, these are much softer. I'll just have to get used to them.

  Don‚Äôt write many reviews but so happy with these that I definitely want to.  EXTREMELY happy with this ball after one round.  Went looking for an inexpensive ball with low compression to fit my low senior swing speed and after reading a bunch of reviews selected these. Found what others say is true.  Only one round of course and used same ball all 18 holes and it held up great. Looked as new as it did on first hole.  And best thing was it performed beautifully.  When I hit good solid shots I was getting from 5 to 10 extra yards on the driver, woods and irons, and around and on the green the softness of the ball stood out.  Great feel to it and proved to be very consistent.  Like I said only one round but I expect similar performance in future.  And the price is right too!!

  Ok everyone, here is the breakdown. I am a solid golfer and won a couple tournament last few years and these golf balls are great. Sure they are not top notch but of you loose balls a lot thos os your best option. Great product for the money. Bottom line is this.... if Tiger Woods hit with this ball, you would realize it isn't the ball that gives you birdies or triple bogies, its usually your swing. So buy these with confidence as they are good balls.

This was a pleasant surprise‚Ä¶ I just found a great all around ball at an incredibly low price.

  I bought these specifically for the color. This review isn't about playability. I'd need to be a heck of a lot better at golf for the ball to be a viable variable in my game... Golfing is more fun (to me) when playing with fun balls. I lose them frequently and couldn't justify the $35/pack price for the Volvic Vivid purple ones, hence, I went with these. They're a nice and bright matte purple, and I think more vibrant than in the product photo, so it's a win in my book. Looking forward to playing with them this weekend!

  Bought these for my wife, they fly and play great but they are incredibly hard to see.Often when she plays with this ball we find ourselves searching for her golf ball in the middle of the fairway or just off the edge in the slightly taller grass, it's just so hard to see this color.

  Perfect for myself as a second time beginner. Getting back into golf after 10-15 years. Anyways, love how far and super light these are. Did okay in the wind climates too. These are super hard to see where they land from the T, but once you‚Äôre on the fairway, about 5 feet away looking for your ball they are easier to spot. I do love the color though!

  i love these balls. i was sick and tired of white balls, and was struggling with the fact that almost all ladies balls were pink. i was super thrilled when i found these and i love using them. super easy to find in the grass when you mess up and hit badly, and when hit well they fly far. the only time ive ever lost a ball was in the water because like i said, they really stand out in grass. they are also super easy to track in the air because of their color as well. 10/10 my only brand of balls i will use

  I bought this glove despite the picture proof people were showing. This glove certainly fits like a second skin. But as the picture shows, within the first few seconds of me putting on the glove it ripped in between the fingers. I have seen reviews showing the leather ripping in different parts of the glove, and although that has not happened to me yet, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it did. I believe for the price that this glove is, people should not run into any problems like what is happening to many. I love Taylormade, so it strongly upsets me to have gotten a poor quality product from them

  Glove fit really nice I liked the look, loved the feel compared to other gloves. However the Velcro on the glove I received does not stay attached at all. Ripped multiple times during my back swing to the point I bought a new glove at the clubhouse. Glove was basically unusable. Could just be mine, but Id look somewhere else

  very well-made glove, and it actually fits. I've always just grabbeda glove off the rack at Big 5 or Sports Authority, and with theirlimited selection, I've never found a glove that fits my hand properly.This ""cadet"" size is perfect, and the glove is much softer than thosemass market ones as well. It remains to be seen how it will hold upover time, but given the quality of the materials and stitching, Iwouldn't be surprised to have it last over multiple seasons.

  I got this during the Prime Day sale just to try it out. I normally wear Titleist or Footjoy gloves but saw this on sale and figured out I'd try it. To my surprise it's the best glove I've ever worn. I haven't put it through it's paces, but it's so buttery soft that I don't mind if it last less than the others, it feels amazing on my hand!

  Off the bat I have to say that this is one of the most comfortable gloves i've used and I really love the look and feel of it. The tear was right on the back of my hand where the velco is and it teared along that line as i was adjusting the glove on my hand. It was really unfortunate, but I have to say that when I contacted TaylorMade about this, they immediately set me up with a representative who got my information and are sending me a replacement for it. I'm hoping this is just a one off and i'll be more careful about adjusting (pulling the end of that side). Otherwise great glove, great fit, great look and thanks to TaylorMade for the great customer service and replacement. Solid 4 stars and would recommend this to anyone who wants a soft glove.

  I have been using FJ gloves forever. I tried this TM. It feels great, I find it fits my hand very well. I like the features of the glove. However, like with alot of the players gloves, it seems to be built for the tour player that is given a new glove (or gloves) for every round. I found significant wear in the heal of my hand after 2 rounds. It has not torn through and there is plenty of life left in the glove everywhere else. However, my FJ gloves last 15 rounds or range sessions. Again, I LOVE the feel, just not sure that I would buy it again for the $ compared with the lack of durability.

  I used this glove twice after hitting golfs into net and it rubbed a hole in the palm. Only had the glove for 4 days. Tried to reach out to Taylormade by phone and I was redirected to a phone line with complete silence. Waited on the line ten minutes. No one ever picked when I called multiple times. Sent them an email 5 days and yet to hear anything back. Spent thousands of dollars on clubs from them and they can‚Äôt reach out to me replace a golf glove. Very disappointed in them and their service.

  These gloves fit like a second skin, thicker than your own, but allowing for sensitivity for holding the club shaft with feel, protecting ones' hands from developing sore spots and blisters. I use these gloves both on the golf course and hitting practice balls, probably between 300 - 600 swings per practice session 3 to 5 times a week. The gloves, although quite stained, have no rips or tears and are just as comfortable as when I first started using them about 6 weeks ago. Quality product.

  Taylormade Tour Preferred is a great golf glove. It‚Äôs designed to be extremely thin and allow excellent feel of the golf club.Some have complained about durability and that they wore a hole in it their first use...I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre using it for but it‚Äôs definitely not a properly gripped golf swing.Is the Taylormade TP glove the most durable, absolutely not, it‚Äôs designed for feel not yard work.I‚Äôve played approximately 20 rounds with this glove, make sure it air dries after use and it is now showing wear spots in the usual places. I would guess it has 1-2 more rounds left before it needs replacing.It has stayed soft and has conformed well to the shape of my hand.I am very happy with this glove and will be ordering a few more to get me through the season.

  I'm a cadet medium, and have been a fan of these gloves for as long as they've made them! They seem to wear a little more quickly than some of the other gloves I've tried, but I would still consider them plenty durable. I'm a 6 handicap and generally play through a two or three gloves per season.

  I was pretty disappointed because I am a huge TaylorMade fan. I ordered the cadet‚Äôs medium/large because I have long fingers and the glove is too big. I exchanged it for a small/medium and it fits more like a medium and still was too big for my hands. I would pass on these gloves unless you have normal or  unusually large hands.

  Wrist section completely tore the very first time I put the glove on. Not impressed at all. For what is suppose to be the high end of Taylormade gloves I expect a lot more durability than that. They are more comfortable than my FootJoy gloves but as an amateur that doesn‚Äôt get gloves given to me for free I can‚Äôt justify spending $25 on a glove that can‚Äôt be worn a single time.

  This ball is very similar in playability to the Callaway Superhot.The feel is good, though not as nice as the TP5 or Chromesoft,which cost over twice as much. Distance-wise, I can see nodifference between these and the premium balls. They seemto produce less spin, which is good off the tee for an averagegolfer, not so good when approaching the green.

0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,"TaylorMade Kalea Golf Balls, Peach (One Dozen) , Large",$19.99,5.0,"
  I am an amateur golfer whom loses many balls - depending on the course - and these balls are easily the most eye catching ones out there - the color is very unique - it's a sort of ""salmon"" and ""Peach"" color, but not  the pink or orange which are seen on many other balls on the course.The matte finish is nice and the feel of the ball when striking it is also acceptable and good.  I will purchase these again since I've already lost (through golf play) most of the original box that I purchased.I'd rate them 5 stars except for the observation that they're not as visible as one would think, when the ball is lying in the rough, off the fairway, not on the green.
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,"TaylorMade Kalea Golf Balls, Peach (One Dozen) , Large",$19.99,5.0,"
  I like to use the bright matte finish balls. Normally I use the Volvo and occasionally Callaway. Last week I tried the Taylormade Kalea and I am sold!  My golf partner said he thought it was going farther so I hit the Kalea and then a Callaway. Both were good hits and I probably got 15-20 yards more out of the Kalea. The only negative I have found is that I love purple but they are hard to see but the peach ones are very bright.

  If you love the color coral, these are for you. Most of us aren't pros so the difference between a calloway, pro v1, taylor made, etc. isn't going to change your game. Be real. If you want a beautiful matte coral colored ball, buy these.

0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,TaylorMade 2019 High Crown Visor,$19.99,1.0,"
  I've owned many high crowned golf visors and this one is nothing like the others in the worst possible way. There's no padding or insulation built in like normal visors have to absorb sweat/give it structure which makes it super flimsy. Worse, it's like they didn't use an actual head form to fit it to when making because it doesn't ""wrap"" around your head like it should. It's sort of blocky because it doesn't taper as it forms around your head. I love high crowned retro style visors and this one is going back for lack of quality, fit, and pretty sure it's not even Taylormade brand. It has no label insignia other than the writing across the front and the crappy tags on it all say made in china which make it seem like a cheap Chinese knockoff.

0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,TaylorMade Project (s) Golf Balls (One Dozen),$20.00,5.0,"
  Full disclosure ,,,,, breaking 100 is a good golf day for me.  One of my many problems is a wicked, power robbing slice that seems to come and go.  I decided to buy the Project (S) balls after loaning one from a friend, although $2 per ball is steep since I tend to lose a few balls each round.  Well, the results where great!  Drives were longer and straight consistently.  But the biggest surprise was the high, long and straight iron shots into the greens.  First full round with these balls I shot an 86 which is mediocre for most golfers but a breakthrough for me.  Golf is fun again!

  These are  designed to work well with smaller hog rings, from 3/16"" up to 1/2"".  It seems to be the case that most of the others out there i.e. the ION Tool version and others, are geared more towards larger rings - 3/8"" to 3/4"".  The only real difference  difference between the two is how the grip area for the hog ring is upset during fabrication.  The Taylor Made version is upset much less for use on the smaller rings.

  I really like the TM Soft Response ball.  It feels good on the club and the performance is great.  I had been playing the TP5, but feel this ball works better for me.  My dislike is the color.  I like red balls because they are easier for me to see against the sky.  Unfortunately,  these 'red matte' balls are more orange than red.  If you are playing on brownish grass, they can be hard to find on the ground.  I wish they had used the same bright red as Volvic or my old  Bridgestones.

  Great golf ball for the money. If you're not looking to spend on the tour response or the other higher end balls this is perfect for you. Had been playing the distance+ since they're so cheap but decided to give these a shot and they definitely have more feel to them than the distance+ on top of being softer.
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,TaylorMade Soft Response Golf Ball,$24.97,5.0,"
  I usually play the Bridgestone extra soft or Calloway Supersoft. This ball is just as soft but seemed slightly lighter and I got more distance with this ball than I get with the previous brands mentioned. Nothing against the Bridgestone or Calloway as I would play with those as well, but I like this ball just as much if not more than others due to the extra distance I got all around.  This ball will stay straight as well just like the Bridgestone. I‚Äôm not a really good golfer (excited when I break 100) but I play a lot and the softer balls are better for me and my swing.Great ball if you‚Äôre looking for a soft feel with great distance.

  Looks great! I have mainly older red, white and black TaylorMade club covers in my bag, but they did a such great job updating the color scheme while sticking to the same basic design that my new to me SIM hybrid 4 looks good with my older clubs.

Pretty cool (I‚Äôm sure other covers do the same, but it was neat to discover).

0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,TaylorMade Project (a) Golf Balls (One Dozen),NA,5.0,"
  I switched to these balls about 7 months ago. For the performance level, these are well worth the mid-range price. There was some initial adjustment to the increased spin around the greens, but that's a good problem to have! With increased greenside spin, I was worried that they might also spin more off the driver. Wrong, I am actually finding more fairways and having fewer lost balls (my usual courses have quite a bit of water and OB). For me, distance is comparable to other top balls I have tried, and there are no durability issues. I will get more of these!
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,TaylorMade Project (a) Golf Balls (One Dozen),NA,5.0,"
  I used this ball for the 1st time yesterday. It performed great - long off the tee and sticking on the greens. It's hard to tell, but I think it was a few yards longer with the driver.  And the ball on the greens was next to the ball mark with shorter irons and didn't roll far with longer irons. Ball had a very nice, soft feel. I've been playing Bridgestone Tour RX some, Titleist Pro V1 some, Pinnacle Rush some, Callaway Soft some, etc. I have never settled in any one ball. Maybe until now. I am 72, play from 6,000+ yards, have a 6.5 HI, and a swing speed of 90-100. Don't know how much of the last sentence is relevant, but this ball suits my game well.

  I bought my first sleeve of these balls on a whim when I went to the course without enough balls.  I was playing Kirkland Signature 3-piece for the cost savings.  These had such a good feel and distance that I ended up buying a dozen, even though they're more expensive than the K Sigs.  I also appreciate the bright yellow color.  It's really more of a greenish yellow, and it's hot hot HOT.  It's dumb, but I also like the double numbers (00, 11, 22, 33).  Well done, Taylormade!

  I've purchased project a's in stores many times and these are not the same. The yellow on these golf balls wears off immediately. One hole and there are already scuff marks from each shot. The yellow was rubbing off on a couple of the golf balls right out of the package. Bummed they no longer make these, I was I could load up on amazon. I recommend you pass on these and pay the extra $5 for the new Tour Response in store.

  great balls and great durability but it appears the yellow is painted/coated on not a yellow cover like most other balls. so after a few wedges or sand shots you will see the white start to show through. not real cuts or chips just the color. so a ball will look pretty beat up but still be in good shape.

  I fell In love  with this hat instantly when I saw pictures online. I found it great that it‚Äôs NOT like every hat you see on the course and on TV (sorta get sick of the same 3-4 looks). The color options are great, and I found this baby blue accented hat to look sick with my dark blue TM bag. The black under-brim keeps reflected  sun off your face, and the snap-back is solid and well affixed. It IS on the deeper side when it comes to hat, I tried to show this in the attached picture compared to a standard baseball cap. For me, it results in a super comfortable, highly stylish cap that is a confidence booster in and off the course. Hit em straight!Quality: A+Style: A++ (unique, great colors)Fit: B+Price:B-Overall: B-I hope this review was helpful, if so let me know below; any questions, please ask!

  I bought these rain gloves ahead of a golfing trip to Scotland in Aug 2018 (8 courses over 17 days).  Others who made similar travels for golf in Scotland told that given the Scottish summer (meaning weather!), rain gloves were essential.It was good advice.  We caught rain on our first day out, and so out came the rain gloves.  Truly essential for gripping wet clubs. I likeed them sooooo much I wore the gloves every day we played golf -- rain or shine (or even just threatening clouds).  Recommended.NOTE: Amazon's pricing for this product seemed to vary by size.  One of my Scotland golfing companions paid about $17 for his  pair of Taylor Made Rain Gloves (size M), while my Cadet XL gloves were $35.

  For a premium golf brand I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in these TaylorMade gloves. Wore through the palm of my lead hand half way though the winter season. I golf once a week and have had gloves that last for half a year or more. I‚Äôll attempt to replace these and see if I just got a bad batch.Other than the longevity of the material these have great feel and grip in the wet seasons.

  The absolute worst golf rain glove ever. I‚Äôve worn these gloves for a total of 21 holes of golf. That‚Äôs just over one round. Now there is about an 1 1/2‚Äù hole in the back of the right glove. Terrible quality control. Never buy anything from Taylormade again.

  I always liked TruVis balls, but felt like they didn‚Äôt help with anything other than seeing spin on the ball. The first generation of Pix didn‚Äôt excite me because it looked like an after thought.  These balls are great!  The Pix on the ball are sleek and are a cool graphic, and the design for helping aim the ball is fantastic!  Being given a margin either side helps me with lining up the putt!  I bought 4 boxes, they are a little pricey, but definitely a great ball from my first impressions on the practice green.I removed 1 Star.  These balls are gorgeous, but the graphics are not exactly lined up on the ball-  yes you can see how it‚Äôs rolling, but the graphics could become a distraction. Definitely hurts more losing these than other balls.  If they had a multi pack deal- would be more tolerable, but I guess they have to pay for Rickie‚Äôs contract.

  I know it‚Äôs a silly milestone, but for a medium-high handicapper like me who have lost 15-24 balls on many rounds it was a pretty awesome achievement. The ball feels quite a bit harder/firmer than the TP5, it still feels good off my Scotty Cameron but a little ‚Äúclicky‚Äù, which I personally don‚Äôt mind. I went with the yellow ball because of my ball losing past, these are quite easy to see, even among yellow range balls because they are so bright. They generate a ton of distance with all my clubs and a lot of spin off irons to hold greens. Felt great off the driver and hybrids off tees and had a piercing long flighted baby draws. The only thing for me was that they added 10 yards to all my clubs vs. Titleist AVX 2019 which I was trying out and liked. But this is just better perfomance. I think this is pretty close to Pro V1x which is also about ideal for me performance wise. TP5 and ProV1 feels a little softer which some like,  but gives up some performance for me. For chipping it gets awesome spin and I can get it close to the hole on regular chips from missed greens because the spin helps it stop faster. I‚Äôm not afraid to put some spin on this ball hitting with a little more swing speed on chips and flight it a little closer to the hole. Played one my best rounds with this ball, will keep them in the bag for now :)

  I don't game with these, but needed something for my SkyTrak simulator to get more accurate spin numbers and not have to replace balls every month due to logos wearing off.  These are perfect for that.  Simulator always picks up the hits and spin numbers are pretty close to what they should be.  Also after a month of hitting them 200-300 times a day on average the logos on them still look brand new.

  I play TP5X white balls regularly for their spin controll, particularly the spin control in the wind.  I draw a putting line on all of my golf balls.  I have tried to hit other balls with ‚Äúpix‚Äù designs, such as the soccer ball pattern look, and didnt like looking down at that.I thought I would give these a try.  I found that I am hitting them cleaner.  Maybe its me, but the pix give me a focal point helping me keep my head down.  The marks on the ball create a clear path when putting and help me line the ball up cleaner.Playing in a pro-am Monday and shipping is delayed.  I will be going to the local sports store to find them.

  When looking to splurge a bit for the holidays, I was deciding between Titleist Pro- V1s, TaylorMade TP5/TP5x and Callaway Chrome Soft and figured i would try and stay brand loyal with Taylormade, but wow was I disappointed. (Understatement)The design is cool and all, but quality is sub par at best. I pulled a brand new ball out of the bag, hit the green and the ball was already scuffed up and deemed lower quality than a provisional ball. The ball would get shredded and chipped even when playing a municipal par 3 course (hitting the majority of fairways and greens).It makes me question if the balls i got on sale were made with lower quality material for the bulk sale. (Maybe capitalize on the increase interest in golf since the pandemic)Safe to say i will be trying other brands now.

  I'm a much better than average golfer, an 8 handicap having been established on PGA tournament courses.  I can tell the difference between a Pro V1 and a Pro V1x by how they feel coming off the club face and the path of their flight.I could play the TP5x or the Pro V1x every day and be delighted with either and both.
"

  Most golfers do NOT need a ball that spins.  It may help you score on the green,  but hurts you off the tee.These are great balls.  Probably the longest of all the 'premium' balls,  but if you have a very high swing speed (over 118) these balls will occasionally go astray if not hit perfect.The only real mark down is value,  they are too expensive.  Unless you are a very low handicap golfer,  stick to something that spins less.

  My older brother will not play with anything else. Perfect Christmas gift for him since they are not super cheap, but know for sure they will be used. Honestly, when I play with them I do see a difference, but I do not play all the time like he does. So if he says they are great and will not use anything else then I take his word since he golfs almost every day.

  The picture is after 13 holes of play, no tour ball looks better longer. TP5x bores through the wind and cold weather affects it very little. As a lifelong player, Golf Coach and former Sales Mgr at Golfsmith, this is the all-around best ball. ProV1 is softer around the green, but looks like shit after 3 holes and it's affected greatly by wind. TP5x will give you higher ball flight and longer carry than TP5, spins a little less, but holds greens well.

  This ball plays like a $4 ball should. If you are a golfer that loses a half dozen balls a round- this ball my prove too costly. But if you are a mid to low handicapper there is no doubt a better ball is worth the investment. Personally, after I‚Äôve spent $1000 bucks on my clubs, I refuse to short myself with cheap balls. And make no mistake. It‚Äôs QUALITY you pay for with a premium ball like this. And the TP5x is one of the best 2 or 3 balls on the market.

  I used one ball for 2 complete rounds before I lost my nerve and went to new ball. The cover stayed mostly intact and has proven durable even after multiple club strikes! After retiring that ball, the new ball in play promptly hit a concrete cart path and scuffed a little so they are not cart path proof, but are otherwise the most durable Tour Ball I have ever played. I usually buy end of season Tour Balls when they drop by $10 or more and stockpile them like the world's ending. ProV1s are my #1 favorite to play because they sound and feel so beautifully when struck right, but I have no hesitation at putting the TP5x in play during my golf league. Short irons and wedges I can usually one hop and stop or spin back, depending on the conditions, no matter the ball I play, and these TP5x balls are no different. For me, the reason to use Tour Balls is for the extra distance, less unwanted sidespin on straight shots, and more shaping spin when I want to work the ball (driver cuts on doglegs, big hook-draws on sucker pins, etc.).One thing I have to remember is that with the stop and drop Tour Balls, you don't get that extra roll-out like on the range, so on a 130 yard approach shot with the pin in the back, you better have your distances dialed in because you will need to land the ball as close to the pin as possible unless you like 80 foot putts.I like the Callaway Superhots for distance and supreme durability but I find that I can't work them as subtly as Tour Balls. Putting Tour Balls feel much better than anything else and TP5x fits that bill too.I don't know if Callaway and TaylorMade designate the ""x"" balls the same as Titleist's ""x"" because I prefer TP5x and ChromeSoftX along with ProV1 (not V1x). It's my understanding that the ProV1x flies higher with the ProV1 having a more penetrating trajectory which appears to align with Callaway's and TM's ""x"" line. Regardless, I don't think you can go wrong with the TP5x if you are used to playing a Tour Ball and would be a great introduction to Tour Balls if you wanted to make the switch. Buy them at the end of the season to save some money before they add new and improved technology to the next model.For reference, I usually hit my XR16 driver about 290 on the range and get about 305+ with Tour Balls on the course.

  I tried a buddy's TP5 and I was sold on the distance, spin, and feel (sound) of the ball. I bought a dozen of TP5 and started using them. A few people I played with mentioned how well my ball was checking on the green. I didn't consider the TP5x because I thought the TP5x would not give me an advantage because of the higher compression. So while playing a round of golf with a TP5 I found an almost new TP5x in the rough so I played on the next hole (Par 5). I saw the distance from the tee and off the deck with my 3 wood but my 3rd shot on to the green was beyond expectations! It was a bit higher than my normal approach shots and it was right on target. It checked and stayed below the hole. I can see playing a TP5 when you don't want your approach shots to go higher because of the conditions but otherwise the TP5x works for me.

  - To say these balls are almost mint could not be further from the truth, the only thing I got that was as described is the number of balls I received.- Numerous balls have chips and scratches in them that render them useless since I would not hit these balls with my clubs. After scanning through all 36 balls, I have 12 that I'm going to keep. There are 19 that have horrible scratching and 5 were actual labeled practice balls.- I have purchased recycled balls from several other places(I like to spread my business to multiple places) without issue and this is a huge disappointment.

  These balls are perfect for my shag bag. I made the decision to switch to Taylor Made TP5 balls and play with them exclusively. I wanted to fill my shag bag with TP5s but didn't want to pay $4.00 per ball to do so. These refurbished balls are perfect. They are all Taylor made TP5, TP5x or Penta TP5. Although not exactly the same regular TP5 they are close enough and will work perfectly for my chipping practice. I'm not sure why people were complaining about these, maybe I just got a good batch but as far as I can tell these balls were exactly what I was looking for.I bought brand new balls to actually play with, but these refurbished balls were in great condition and perfect for my shag bag for practicing.

  I‚Äôm an avid golfer and I‚Äôve been using this baby for 90% of my short game plays. It‚Äôs beautifully polished chrome is so stunning to look at and the club face is so big my confidence is way better when it‚Äôs tome for short game. Speaking of that my short game is way better since I‚Äôve been using this High Bounce 60¬∞. For me at normal swing speed I can bump and run the ball out to 40-50 yards. Went a head and bought the 56¬∞ and 52¬∞ to complete my wedge set. Quality and performance and beautifully in one package.

  The club is great, the problem is in the products description. I ordered a standard bounce ( which I think is 8-9), on the picture of the product description , that‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs pictured. When my club came the bounce was 12.  I think perhaps the warehouse people don‚Äôt know the difference, they just see it‚Äôs a 56 degree wedge and that‚Äôs it....:(

  I am a TaylorMade client for life....all my clubs, hats, gloves, balls, etc.  So it's difficult for me to write this review.  But this bag is pretty poorly built and just feels generic in every way.  I set it down on the stand for the first time, and 20 seconds later my clubs crashed into the ground.  The legs are so short and wide, the bag literally lies 18inches off the ground -- I may as well just be lying them on the ground instead.  Sadly disappointed.

  Been buying on amazon for years and this is my first review. This is a terrible bag. After maybe 4 rounds of golf some of the stitching around the pockets unraveled.  Also, the kick stand failed to keep the bag upright. The legs splayed out and the bag dropped to the floor (see photo). The body of the bag flexes when the legs take on weight, so the legs have no chance. Do not buy. Returned to Amazon for a refund. Had to drive to Kohls to return since I didn't have the shipping box any longer.

  Some of the pockets were ripping as well as the club dividers coming loose after 3-4 months of normal use. This bag is made and shipped to Amazon and other big box sporting goods stores, so avoid it because most Taylormade dealers can't help you. I purchased another Taylormade bag and it's a lot higher quality. I called Taylormade and they shipped a new bag to my house. Thanks Taylormade!!!

  The bag looks great, is very lightweight and has a lot of pockets.  It fits all my gear and even my shoes.  I even carry a small first aid kit, bug and sun spray.  The legs go out evenly and seem very sturdy.  I carry too many clubs so I sometimes have to wiggle the bag to get one back in but that is my only complaint, though it's partially my fault.  I carry all my woods, irons and 2 utility clubs.  I've been out 7 times with the bag and no issues yet.

  I get a lot of compliments on this golf bag. It's fairly sturdy when I use the stand while walking 9 holes. The straps are comfortable enough that my shoulders aren't sore or rubbed raw after a round. I also like the many pockets it has. No obvious wear and tear after 3 months of use.

  I inherited my old bag from my father, so it was going on 25 years of use. It was beginning to look aged, and the stand-up legs were not as steady as they used to be. For a reasonable amount of money, I was able to upgrade my golf experience with this Taylor Made bag. It's super lightweight, a handsome color, and versatile with lots of pockets and strong zippers. The legs snap to attention and hold up a full bag with ease. I'm really happy with the size, color, and usefulness of this bag.

  This bag has all the features and pockets of my older bag and is considerably lighter.  Not sure why some reviews said the height of the bag with the stand is low as it's the same as my older bag and seems about standard.  I'm 6'0"" and don't have to bend down to pull clubs out of the bag with the stand extended.  It even came with a rain hood which was a nice surprise.  Finding a rain hood to match your bag is a chore as there's no standard fit so it's great that it was included.  Just got the bag so can't comment on durability but I'll add a revised comment if I run into problems.  All in all a great bag for the price.

  I usually use a 6 iron but the performance the 3-5 hybrids has provided made me take a chance on a 6 hybrid. I couldn't be happier. This club hits straight as an arrow and gets the ball out of think rough when an iron would dig in. The club itself is built well and has TaylorMade's good looks. Give it a try and I guarantee you will drop your 6 iron in favor of the 6 hybrid.

  If you don't have a Hybrid Rescue club in your bag like i didn't have until now, I highly recommend this club.  it has been a life saver.  with the twisted face technology it seems that the ball flies off the club a lot straighter. little to no slice or fade.  i now can't blame my club for when a hit one in the trees.

  Club is awesome, added 50+ yards and very easy to hit straight,  would give a minus 5 stars on the grips, very poor and cheap grips, after a couple of rounds they get hard and slippery.  If you purchase the Taylor Made M2 set you may want to invest in regripping right away. For a $1500 complete set you think they would give you better quality grips.

  I bought this hybrid used and the advertised condition was ‚Äúvery good.‚Äù  The club arrived earlier than the day it was expected and the condition of the club was amazing, better than I ever could have expected considering the price and how quickly it came in. I wasn‚Äôt sure about buying a used golf club on Amazon but with this experience it will definitely not be the last. Oh and finally I got a chance to hit the 3 hybrid on the range a few times and out on the course once so far and it sounds and feels great. So much easier to hit than my 3 iron and I get better height and the ball lands much softer.

  Great wedge. Seems a little heavy compared to my older wedge. But overall i dont get much spin on my wedges although im not on the PGA tour so I didn‚Äôt expect to spin it like tiger.

  I bought this bag a little under 4 months ago. I carry my clubs a lot when I am golfing. About a month after I got it, on the inside of the bag where the clubs go, the cloth started to come undone. About 2 weeks ago, the strap came off of the bag when I picked it up to carry it (the stitching came undone). I am able to make due, I have attached the strap to the plastic rim so I can continue to carry my clubs. I tried to submit a warranty claim on the Taylor made website, but it will only submit the form for clubs. So overall, if you are looking for a good bag to carry/ walk, I would not recommend this one. After only 4 months and probably about 20 times golfing, I am already in need of a new one.

  This thing is amazing. I cannot believe I've waited this long to buy a TM hybrid. They've always fit my eye all the way back to when the burner hybrids came out. I just never pulled the trigger.I typically hit a 3 iron about 200-210. This 3 hybrid will go about 230 (off a tee) if I hit it well. But even the mishits off the toe are still going about 220 and STRAIGHT. extremely straight club. Very very impressed.

The blue is blue an not purple per someone's post.  The compartments are nice sized and present well when bag is stashed on cart.

  The quality of the product is apparent the moment you take it out of the box. My other half is an avid golfer who was in need a 14-way divide cart bag. The durable stitching and quality material used to stitch the bag made the price a steal! With numerous pouches and pockets, this is the idea for a golfer who wants to be prepared for anything and everything.

  I had an odyssey white hot blade putter for about 13 years prior to this putter. I decided to switch because i wanted a 35"" putter (mine was 34), i needed a new grip anyway, my old putter cover was faded, and i thought it was time to see if tuere was any benefit to the chunkier head as far as improving stability while putting.Yes! The first hole of the first round i could immediately feel better control and aim. It's not a miracle worker - i didn't suddenly make every putt - but i could feel confident in my putts. Admittedly, the extra weight made me a bit skittish, especially on those 25+ foot putts, but in just 3 or 4 rounds i have been putting better than ever.Good reaction of the face, and the cover is very high quality.

  I really like the style of this cart bag and after a few rounds I am pretty happy with the function as well.  The large side pockets are very spacious, I can get my shoes inside one of them and plenty of room in the other for rain hood (sold seperately BTW), jacket, pullover etc.  Just enough smaller pockets for my needs, but I wish there was a tee ""holster"" on the outside of the bag.  Not a huge deal really, just my preference.  The cart strap pass-through is nice, makes accessing all pockets easy.

  Great bag in general, lightweight and easy to handle. I‚Äôm very happy with it for the most part, but just a couple things that could be better, especially on a bag this expensive. There is only one plastic ring for hanging towels, brush, etc.  Not a huge deal, but one on each side would be better. I‚Äôve also found that when carrying with the strap, the bag tends to tilt forward too much. The first time I used it I nearly dumped my clubs out.

Our favorite part though was that we got to get it embroidered for free with his name. Literally we filled out the form and about a week and a half later they sent us the replacement zippered pocket with his name embroidered! I had planned on getting his name put on there and I got it done for free! Yessss!!

  I like the bag itself, it has plenty of storage. It looks clean and sleek.I was a little let down however, with the personalization option. I was supposed to get free personalization on the front pocket, but when I logged in to do it, my color bag was no longer available for personalization. I logged in 2 days after I received the bag, with the promo code.Other than that, the bag itself is pretty nice. I just feel a little cheated on the deal. . .

  I have a TaylorMade driver and it improved my game so when I researched new bags, this model TaylorMade came up at best. Golf Avenue had it in stock and made me a decent deal and handled the order efficiently.I'm very pleased with the very well thought out design for convenience and easy access and it's well made. Plus I think it looks great. Not sure it'll help my game, but I'm very pleased with it and glad I bought it.

  This is a great golf bag. It has a lot of storage, the cooler pocket fits a 6 pack with an igloo cooler ice pack in it,  and the dividers go to the bottom. I bought the silver white,  black, and red bag. The silver white is more silver than white, and it gets dirty quickly, but it cleans up well.

  Probably the 5th putter style I've owned in the 40 years of playing and easily the best. Ball jumps off the face and has a wide sweet spot. Only issue is I wanted the shorter 33"" shaft but both the 33"" and 34"" were 349 and I got the 35"" for 289. So have to cut it down when I change the grip. Other than a coupl hit behinds it's been great. Just have to remember to choke down to the end of the grip.

  I've been playing golf since the days of persimmon woods and like all golfers I've purchased numerous putters always thinking this one will do it for me. This one did. There's a reason the pros putt so well beyond the carpet greens they play on and the reason is equipment. The Spider S has a nicely weighted large head with plenty of forgiveness and it's face weighted. Easier to take it straight back and straight through. It's key to place the head on the ground as it's designed, don't lean the shaft forward. This putter is designed with the shaft leaning slightly back to allow you to hit up on the ball for a very smooth roll. Swing it back with whatever stroke you use and let the head swing through. You'll love how the ball has a true end over end roll. Like all putters get in your practice and you'll see that you get a much better roll with the Spider S than on any putter you've ever owned.

  This product is not accurately described on Amazon, although described perfectly on TaylorMade‚Äôs website.I recently purchased my 9 year old son the 6pc set, just to find (after he used them) that the 6pc set is for ages 4+ and the 8pc set is for ages 8+. Also, the clubs listed in the 8pc set on Amazon, do not list the Rescue club, which was the deciding factor in the 6pc v/s the 8pc set, when the 8pc set has the Rescue club included..?I don‚Äôt understand why Amazon does not accurately describe the 6pc set is for ages 4+, then the 8pc set is for ages 8+.I wish I would have ordered directly from TaylorMade, as I can‚Äôt return the used 6pc set which is WAY too small for my 9 year old.Big mistake ordering from Amazon, and I am usually a huge Amazon fan, big time let down for my son‚Äôs birthday present...

  Over the past year I‚Äôve gotten more into golf. I started With a set of old, used clubs. Recently, I‚Äôve been practicing more and more, i‚Äôm looking for opportunities to improve my game. I had the opportunity to test drive some TaylorMade clubs. From the first swing, I was excited and pleased with the results. These crimes have certainly made a difference. From the start, the grip is superb and really does fit like a glove. It is very comfortable and smooth. Overall the club is incredibly balanced, and has a very smooth follow through all the way through the ball. The superbly designed golf club head is engineered for precision. I noticed a significant improvement in both my accuracy as well as being able to more accurately meter the energy I put out in his swing. I‚Äôve noticed a significant improvement in my putting game, both an accuracy of the distance I am able to make shots room. Very happy to have this club in my golf bag.

  The only golfing I'm doing these days is putting in the basement or backyard. Can't get out of the house to go to the golf course, so that option's right out the door. It is, however, an amazing opportunity to test out a new putter these days.I'm very happy with this. Extremely quality grip in every way - I feel very comfortable holding it my hand. It's weighted appropriately and works spectacularly. I'm still a terrible putter, but I certainly won't blame the club. It has a large and forgiving face, which makes my putts feel less terrible.

  If you're having trouble shedding number off your golf game, being able to sink putts is a good way to do it. This putter will level the playing field and give you the added confidence to improve your game.My favorite part about this putter is the ""True Path"" sight lines on the top of the putter. It is a combination of a big ""T"" and a black line through the middle. The big white ""T"" allows you to easily see your aim direction and get a feel for how square your putter surface is to your ball. The thin black line allows you to dial it in a little more.I don't know the science behind copper being a better putting surface to strike from, but you can't ignore the fact that it looks and sounds amazing. The entire putting surface and three additional accent pieces are made from 100% Copper!The superstroke grip, combined with a no step shaft take out some of the variables that affect a smooth, consistent swing. The standard grip that comes on this club is a 1.0 Pistol Grip.The neck comes in different styles customized for your putting shape. The ""Single Bend"" is for golfers with minimal face rotation, the ""Small Slant"" is for significant face rotation and the ""L-Neck"" if for somewhere in between.Overall a putter that will help drop you putts and drop your score. Try it out and see for yourself.

0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,"Spider FCG Putter #1, L-Neck",$349.99,5.0,"
  This is a great looking putter and one that feels good in the hands.  I have not yet used it extensively, so my review is based on only a few hours on the practice green.Since I have a slight arc to my swing, I ordered the L-Neck putter.  The L-Neck is supposedly designed for golfers with a swing like mine.  This is a good looking club.  Not that looks improve the game, but it does not hurt when the club looks impressive.  The included cover also looks good, fits well, and is soft.When using the club, the first thing that I noticed was the grip.  It felt comfortable in my hands, and since the grip was new, it felt very solid (sticky), with no tendency to slip either with or without a glove.Up until now, I have only used a blade putter, so this mallet putter is a first for me.  Wilson advertises this putter as one that looks like a mallet but that feels like a blade.  Since I have not used a mallet, I cannot compare this club‚Äôs feel to a mallet‚Äôs feel, but compared to my blade, it does seem somewhat similar.  This may be because of the putter‚Äôs ‚ÄúFCG,"" or Forward Center of Gravity, design.  There is a bit more weight to the club head than I am used to, but not so different that I will need a large learning curve to become comfortable using it.  With the contrasting colors on the club head, the sight line is very noticeable and easy to use to line up my puts.I found the swing to have a comfortable feel to it, and not much different from my current putter.  The ball comes off the club stronger, and with a longer roll than usual with similar swing effort, which I will need to get used to. The ball seems to be better aimed than with my other club.  As for whether that is because the aiming line is allowing me to line up better, or because the club design is correcting some of my defects, only more practice will give me that answer.My initial impressions of the putter are very favorable.  I am looking forward to getting more practicewith it, and hopefully I will see an improvement in putting strokes.

  So far I'm really impressed with my Spider FCG Putter.  I have the L-Neck but I doubt that it offers any special advantage over the other two models.I have been using an early John Reuter  Bulls Eye putter for many years,  so something this fancy makes me feel like Al Czervik playing at Bushwood CC.  Yet the transition has been surprisingly easy.  The Bulls Eye was so popular in part because it was more forgiving than other putters.  The positioning of the shaft gave it more MOI (moment of inertia) which meant it had more resistance to twisting.The shaft of the Spider is further back but the blade has so much more mass that twisting is also minimal.  The laws of physics mean that it will continue in the same direction and will do so with less swing  effort.  That keeps club twisting at a minimum for most people.  Couple all that with the three inch center siting line and I think most golfers will find their putts going straighter and with a better line toward the hole.Of course the Spider does not read the green contours for you or determine how fast it is,  skills that take both aptitude and effort.Fortunately the Spider comes with a nice velcro cover because with a head this big it gets a lot more knocking around in my golf bag than the old Bulls Eye.

  This is a fantastic putter. I'm no professional golfer, but I really appreciate the blade-like feel and the copper putter itself. I absolutely love the weight and the swing, as well as the putting guide built into the putter itself.This is an absolutely fantastic product and likely to be a staple in many golfers' bags for years to come.
"
0,SPORTS,TaylorMade,"Spider FCG Putter #1, L-Neck",$349.99,5.0,"
  This is an excellent putter.  It releases and feels like a blade, but with a high-MOI mallet shape that's forgiving and stable.  I highly recommend.

  UPDATE!!!  February 18, 2019I reviewed these arthritis gloves a couple of months ago, and I feel that an update would be necessary. I think my review underestimated the gloves and that‚Äôs why I want to clarify. These are the best arthritis gloves around! After trying numerous different brands I can confidently tell you that this one is a definite winner!! It‚Äôs super soft and comfortable for all day wear. I wear it to work and it doesn‚Äôt interfere with my typing and paperwork at all.These gloves provide me with the perfect compression in my fingers so I finally have some pain relief when I wear them. I was so excited with this find, I make sure to share this big secret with all my family, friends, and acquaintances that might benefit from it. My cousin doesn‚Äôt stop thanking me, she says these gloves changed her whole life. I totally believe her.The quality is top grade. I am constantly washing it and drying it, and by just looking at the gloves you would think it‚Äôs brand new. I am going to place an order right now for an additional pair so I can switch off between the two at night.I recommend these highly and I will continue to do so. I hope with this I can bring relief to soo many people that are desperately looking for it.Don‚Äôt hesitate! Buy your pair right now!!!

  These arthritis gloves saved me. After looking for solutions for almost a dozen of years, I can‚Äôt believe it took me this long to get these.I have been suffering from arthritis for almost 20 years now. In the beginning it was just a little soreness in my fingers and my knees, but with time the symptoms increased and multiplied by leaps and bounds. I began experiencing intermittent pain in the joints, ankle, back, fingers, hands, muscles, neck, and wrist. The pain in the fingers and hands were the worst. They really impacted my day to day life more than anything else.I was becoming handicapped. It was horrible to become so dependent on others at such a young age.¬†In my younger years I have been a court stenographer. As soon as the arthritis symptoms appeared I was forced to give it up. I tried other small jobs over the years, but arthritis ripped me away from the occupation that suited me most.My Dr. referred me to a Rheumatologist who suggested the following:* Hydrotherapy* Stretching* Massages* AcupunctureAnd many more diverse ideas. Some were more soothing and some were less, but that‚Äôs all they were. Soothing. During the hydrotherapy I blessed the instructor.i haven‚Äôt felt so good in years! But that relief was short lived, as it only lasted for a short while, and later that day I was back to square one.My wife and 3 children were all very worried about me. They didn‚Äôt stop suggesting different remedies they have head about:* physical exercise¬†* Weight loss* Heating pad* Ice packs* Cold compressesAnd I tried. I really did. I went through each of them. When it didn‚Äôt work I gave it another chance and another chance. I was sooo desperate!¬†I am big believer of natural, and therefore I didn‚Äôt try any medications. I don‚Äôt believe any of them would have helped anyways!I was beginning to give up hope. I thought I was done for life, since any daily chore became so difficult. I didn‚Äôt like depending on others and being a burden on them.Then a miracle happened. My daughter bought me a pair of ComfyBrace arthritis gloves as a gift for Christmas. I was really skeptical. After nothing helped, why would this be different? Well, you gotta believe it. I was so desperate that I was willing to try anything, and try it I did. It only took a few hours for the gloves to begin their magic. The size large fits me comfortably. (How did my sweet daughter know exactly what size to get? God bless her!) It has the perfect balance. The compression is great, but it‚Äôs not painful. I wouldn‚Äôt say it happened over night, but in a very short time I was doing things again that were very difficult for me a mere 2 days ago.¬†I did not become young again, and I will not be a court stenographer ever again, butat least I got my independence back. I am still looking for a solution to all the other pains, perhaps someone has a solution for that??I ordered another pair, so I can wear it when the other one is in the wash. I couldn‚Äôt wait until it dries to put it back on, a second pair was crucial.So far I have been highly satisfied, and I‚Äôm extremely thankful for this amazing creation.I have been wearing it for only a couple of weeks now, I will definitely update my review in a few weeks to let you know how it has been going!I highly recommend that everyone tries this! Nothing like it....

  I ordered both a medium and a small. My mother and I both have troubles with our hands. She diagnosed osteoarthritis, I have an old boxer fracture and pain in my wrists and hands when I crochet. As far as we can tell, the sizes are the same except the medium has longer fingers, we decided we will keep both for our individual needs. They are not tight around the wrist, just the knuckles and fingers, She's been wearing hers at night with arnica gel and I wear mine while I'm crocheting with a peppermint/eucalyptus liquid, we both feel they are helping so we will order again!!

  MY HANDS HAVE ACHED AND SWELLED UP FREQUENTLY OVER THE LAST YEAR. I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CARPAL TUNNEL AND ARTHRITIS AND STRONGLY SUSPECT TENDONITIS AS WELL. THE DAY THESE ARRIVED MY HAND HAD SWOLLEN UP AND WAS ACHING AND BURNING. IMMEDIATELY I COULD FEEL RELIEF FROM THE SLIGHT PRESSURE OF THE GLOVE. I ACTUALLY SLEPT WITH BOTH OF THEM ON THE FIRST NIGHT. THERE WERE NO RUB MARKS FROM THE SEAMS. THE WRIST AREA AND FINGERTIPS ARE JUST LOOSE ENOUGH TO NOT CUT OFF CIRCULATION. THE FABRIC IS VERY BREATHABLE, THE SEAMS APPEAR STRONG AND DON'T CAUSE ANY FRICTION AND THE MOISTURE WICKING FABRIC IS HIGH QUALITY.. AS FAR AS THE SIZE:  I MEASURED AT EXACTLY 3.5 INCHES ACROSS MY KNUCKLES AND THE MEDIUMS FIT PERFECTLY..I'M VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH THESE..

  I bought this product in June 2018 for severe pain and stiffness in my hands. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. These gloves are absoulutely fantastic! I bought the size small. They fit nicely, just enough compression, but not uncomfortable at all. They are very durable, as well. I've washed them multiple times and they still hold up like day 1. No stitching has come loose, the fabric doesn't pill and they don't make your hands sweat like crazy if you want to do chores or be out side when it's warm outside.I'm extremely happy that I bought these! I really cannot stress enough how much these helped me. When the pain is severe in my hands, I litereally can't move my fingers. AT ALL. Usually after wearing the gloves for the first part of the day I can  clench my right hand, and partially the left and the pain is WAY WAY less than if I had not had them on.

  I suffered for many years from a severe case of carpel tunnel syndrome.  It probably all began because I work for a commercial designing company, and I spend about 8-10 hours a day doing 3D rendering on the computer, which entails a lot of using the keypad and mouse. I used to wake up in the middle of the night with tingling in my hands and sometimes with severe pain. I spent many restless nights twisting and turning in bed.I was advised by my Dr. to try wearing a night brace, and desperate to find a solution to the endless pain I stopped into my local pharmacy to pick up a handbrace from a big brand. I wore it for a few weeks and didn't see any difference, the pain at night was still severe and sleeping at night was almost a thing of the past. Nothing was working until I bought this comfybrace.After using this brace for one night I realized this was really making a big difference. I right away saw major improvement. After months of not being able to sleep at night I started getting a couple of hours of shut eye in a row!! This was a major breakthrough for me. Now that i'm wearing it for two weeks, night pain is a thing of the past. I thought surgery was my only solution, but maybe this is an easier solution!!!This comfybrace is made of durable material which makes it very soft yet sturdy and therefore my hands weren't sweaty from it. Another thing which was very important to me was the super soft and comfortable cushioning beads by the palm. The beads are soft enough that they got molded to the shape of my hand and hold my hand perfectly in that position.My hands are pretty average size for a man, and this glove fits me perfectly!! This brace is really adjustable so it would probably fit most hand sizes, including pretty slim hands and husky ones too.This brace is also made of very high quality materials and is stitched together very strongly. I can see that this will really last me a while. You can also see the picture I have attached showing the high quality stitching.I highly recommend this brace, and it's definitely worth the money. It's not worth  wasting nights when there is such an easy and affordable solution available.Thank you so much Comfy Brace!!!

  I am an RN and have severe issues with carpel tunnel for a very long time that wakes me up frequently from sleep and causes pain when trying to lift or crochet. In fact many nights, the pain is unbearable with numbness in my fingers and stabbing burning elbow and wrist pain. I have tried many braces before and while some have helped, most have been too uncomfortable to wear at night so I have not been consistent in using them. I was hesitant to buy another one, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give this one a try. The first time I put it on I knew it was different with the padding and overall comfort. One of my biggest issues was most other braces felt very warm and making my arm feel clammy and hot, and being from South Texas, I don't want anything making me feel warmer than we already are. I slept all night that first night and most other nights since using it. While I know a brace wont eliminate the problem completely, I recommend this brace for anyone dealing with this painful and annoying issue especially during flare ups of the condition and symptoms. I am getting another just to have for travel as I am very impressed with this product. Whoever created this must have had the issue of carpal tunnel and been frustrated with the current braces on the market and fixed them!! Bravo to you!!

  In the past year or so, I've started twisting one hand and wrist under my head as I sleep, which results in hand swelling and pain when I wake up. My doctor suggested wearing a brace to discourage me from twisting my wrist as I sleep.Well! Easier said than done! I tried two or three braces before this one. One was okay to wear but barely provided any support and did not prevent the twist. Another gave firmer support but was so uncomfortable that I removed in in my sleep (yeah, lifelong sleepwalker here).So then I tried the Comfy Brace. I was a little dubious since it does not come in a right or left hand version, the brace will fit either hand which I thought might mean it would not fit well. I was sooo wrong.Wowza, it works a charm! The three straps provide a more customisable fit so it can be firm enough to discourage the twist but still comfortable enough that I leave it on in my sleep. The cushion full of beads is brilliant--I put it on, wiggle my fingers once or twice, the beads shift into position and I honestly can't feel the metal support (part of the problem with the uncomfortable brace was that the end of the metal support tended to dig into my palm).It has definitely helped my wrist and hand without being uncomfortable at all. It fits like it was made specifically for my hand. Either hand! I've only used it for a couple months, so I don't know yet how it will last (still feels like new). If I ever wear it out, I'll buy another. No more experimenting, this is definitely the perfect design for me.

  These cards look really awesome, however I noticed that the United States playing Card company has not given each jack, queen, and king their own unique look.  Instead the King of Hearts is used for every king, the queen of hearts is used for every queen, and the jack of diamonds is used for every jack.  No one-eyed jack, or one-eyed king, and every king turns suicidal.  The colors are interesting being both orange and lime.  The quality of the cards themselves are also quite nice.  The beautiful Hoyle Shellback is also used.  A good deck, but could be improved upon.MDH

  I thought this deck would be a nice addition to my collection. However, when the deck arrived it didn't look like the photo on the page. It's still a nice-looking deck, as Hoyle/Bicycle decks tend to be, but be advised that it's a standard deck that is a mid-to-dark pink instead of red or blue.

  What you don't see in the picture is that all the cards are the same color. It makes it impossible to see the suit quickly and very easy to misread them (the heart shape is too close to the spade shape). I took a black marker to the dark suits - not something you expect to have to do with playing cards.They came on time - for what that's worth.

  The reviews for this deck have been going on for a while. Reading through some of them before and after buying this product I found many of them to be untrue.The cards I received do not have paint that ""bubbles"" or scratches off; no negative marks there.The look of the cards is pretty cool. Each individual card is a little bit 'glossy', not fully transparent. If you fan the deck in a smooth way you see a cool 'infinity-mirror' affect. The box reminds me a little bit too much of 90s pencil holders.I do agree with a review I read that it would be nice if these cards had the tiniest bit of noticable texture, especially when wet.The worst thing in my experience: card flicking. I have a friend who can stick traditional cards into some suprising surfaces with just a flick of a wrist. I have always been jealous of his skills. Upon receiving these cards, I start to flick them at the wall. One of them shatters. :(Not the intended use of a card... so you have trade offs. Regular cards can be ruined by improper use just as easy as these cards can (as of this review).Final review: cool product, material is no worse than standard cards but has potential.

  These cards are already the hit of the summer!  For $6, we have had so much fun, the kids are rocking their math and are getting a boatload of exercise.Here are the two main ways we use them:1Ô∏è‚É£ Throw some in the pool (they will sink unless sitting perfectly on top of the water) and have a race to get 10 hearts, all even numbers, numbers divisible by 3, etc.2Ô∏è‚É£Throw only the numbered cards (2-10) into the pool (you can do all numbered or only red or black, for example) and then have the kids race to bring back cards which make an equation to make a certain number.  The kids absolutely love this!!!  We also make rules like: - your equation must be at least 3, 4 or 5 cards - we exclude the 10s - we exclude ""double digits""...  meaning you can only get one of each number.  No 2x2, for example - If I'm feeling like a softie, we'll even include the Aces to use as ones. But that makes it soooo much easier so beware! - We throw in more or less cards.  We tend to do one suit per person playing but including more would make it easier to find that one card you are looking forI love how you can tailor this to your child's level.  It has been so fun to see the equations they come back with.  They literally beg for us to do this and I love how they are working on quick math recall....  and simple equations!The ink on the cards is starting to wear off in some places  but we've already used them so much we don't even care.  They have been well worth the price for what we've used them for.  Cheaper than a math workbook and much more fun!As other reviewers have already stated, they are stiff when right out of the package but they do loosen up and become easier to play with outside of the water.  Just realize these are more plastic than paper so will feel different than traditional playing cards.

  Hoyle, if you're reading this--do two things: add a texture to the cards so they're not so slippery, and make the case slightly taller so the whole deck can sit in the ""well"" while playing or taking a break. These cards look good (but not great, a little cheap looking) but I've gotten similar or better cards for less $. Was hoping the brand-name would bring higher quality.

  I do not recommend - the print on the cards scratch off within the first use. The cards would be perfect if the print was laminated to eliminate scratching.  The cards also stick together once wet which makes shuffling a hard task but that's a fair sacrifice for being able to play card games in the pool.  The case is not perforated so the cards need to dry before you put them away.

  I got these for some messy/water games we were playing. They worked well. Some of the images have developped ‚Äúscratches,‚Äù but they are still usable and would be unlikely to receive such rough treatment in a regular game of cards. Extensive play may not be a good fit for this deck, but I would expect that intermittent play should be fine: with no worries about  moisture or spills!They are a bit trickier to shuffle, but nothing you can‚Äôt handle.

  We like these cards, they are able to be used outdoors, in the pool, or inside.  They wash up well, and aren't ruined if you get greasy fingerprints on them during a picnic or while eating.  They are very reasonably priced, however, it takes some getting used to shuffling without spraying cards all over the table (it is good for a few laughs though)!  They are somewhat slippery holding them, especially if you have a lot (10+) in your hand and they slide around in the card holders we have.  Not sure if that is the cards' fault or the holder design.Overall, for the price they are not a bad purchase.  To be honest, we have others, somewhat textured, that we like better.But the design is very fun, and different.

  My husband and I play cards together often and these are the best cards I've ever owned.  They are waterproof so even if we spill something they can just be washed off.  The are pretty indestructible and will always stay crisp and not have bended corners like other cards that have been used a lot.  They are plyable enough to make it easy for my klutzy husband to shuffle.  And for me that is the best part.  Even after bending sharply to shuffle the cards evenly  and easily they go right back to their shape.  They can be a bit slippery but that is not a deal breaker.  The numbers are a good size to see clearly.  I have two decks of these cards and I do wish they came in two different colors to make separating them easier.  These really are the best cards I've ever used and the only ones I'll buy again.

  We just got these and played already a few of the games. They come in individual boxes and are smaller than normal size playing cards but good enough for a 5yr old to manage. The illustrations are cute and simple and each game has a different theme. Yet they‚Äôre not related to the game in any way except Old Maid. Go Fish are fish but they‚Äôre not different kinds of sea animals or anything like that. Over all they are cute and will be played with for a while to come. They‚Äôre a good deal.

  If you got people who spill their drinks when playing cards, you need these. First time using them for a game, someone spilled their drink. These cards held up, the deck of regular playing cards that was set aside were completely destroyed and thrown out. People laughed when I put these on the table, but were sold when the game could continue.

  They are a bit slick and hard to shuffle at 1st but these cards are awesome to play with. After a 3-4 hands they about as easy to shuffle as anything I've every played with.. They are waterproof but if they get wet they stick together and have to be dried. not meant to play with in water. Water wont damage them. We play a lot of cards and these are our go to,

  When covered in water, the cards can tend to stick together, making it harder to deal. When they are dried out they are amazingly similar to shuffling regular cards, and yet I don't worry about them getting wet, which is great. We play in the hot tub, just learned quickly that we don't really want them sopping wet for usability sake. They dry out perfect every time though, so it's all good as long as you can take an extra moment to deal each card out.

  These were a gift for my grandson. He uses them in card-throwing tricks. They fly very well, and they can be used for throwing/slicing tricks. They do chip if thrown against a hard surface.

  i purchased these decks to keep in my bag to pass the time on the occasion that i might be waiting for a while. they are really small, which i expected, but they are smaller than i could've imagined before they were in my hands. shuffling isn't too bad, but bridging can easily turn into a game of 52 card pick-up.the main reason i purchased this set is that i like to play games that require two decks. now, i can carry two in the size of one. that's really great. however, be careful with that stack of cards you have to draw from because now it's the same height as before, but twice as narrow and really easy to knock over if you aren't careful.the main issue with these cards, however, is that it comes sans jokers. i don't understand why anyone would create a deck of cards without jokers. both of the games i tend to play with two decks utilize jokers as wild cards and i'm missing all four of them with these cards. they did bother to put some crappy advertising cards in there though, so i'm just using those as jokers. i think it's really lame to not include jokers at the cost of garbage cards though.overall, it's a great idea. just know the cards require a little extra care to use and have no comic relief included in the decks.

  Good: these are a good size for holding, playing and shuffling - the shuffling is really the key thing - tiny cards can't be shuffled in the same way, but these are easy to shuffle. I bought them because my kid and I play Kings in the Corner on airplane rides and full size cards are a challenge. 5 stars.Less good: The design is wholly uninspired. Everything is just a smushed version of regular cards. This is a missed opportunity! Check out Minim cards for an idea of how brilliant design can be. 3 stars.Bad: the case is terrible!! I don't much care that the case is big - I wasn't getting it for a small thing to carry around, but rather small cards when playing. A smaller case would have been nice. PRO TIP: these cards will fit into a harmonica pouch, but not all harmonica cases. But I give the case these cards came in 1 star or 0 stars - the two decks slide into each other! They designed a holder for these tiny decks and didn't put the dividing plastic high enough to divide the decks. Ugh!

  I bought these to take backpacking. Usually mini decks of cards are hard to play with because they're so small so I hate taking the. These are easier to play with because these are as tall as cards but half the width. Saves some ounces if you're backpacking. The only issue that I have is that I can't do my favorite bridge shuffle with them.

  These are odd little cards but I surely love them.  So easy to shuffle.  And there is space on the cards for notes... if you want to use this as a practice deck. The card stock is top rate.  Nice coating.  And if you use a sharpie marker to add notes, alcohol cleans it off in a snap.

  Get these cards just for the conversations that they generate.  Exactly like you cut a regular deck in half lengthwise.  Great for those who really want to minimize the load that they carry.  Takes about ten minutes to get used to them.  I keep them in my backpack.  There are two jokers that come with the deck.  I like jokers, even though I never use them in play, because if you damage one of the playing cards, you can take a marker and make the joker the replacement card so you still have a full deck.  Am I cheap or what?

  4 stars for the card design --- pretty much standard-height Hoyle cards at half the width, as described. Nice.1 star for everything else. #1 complaint would be the lack of jokers. Pretty inexplicable and annoying.Beyond that, I'm not a fan of the packaging/housing. I like to carry playing cards in my bag, but space is at a premium so I was hoping to find something that would occupy a little less real estate than a standard deck. I have tried those ""mini"" cards which are normally proportioned cards, but miniaturized to around a 50% scale. Those are fine in a pinch, but I found the full-size height of these cards very appealing. So I was disappointed to discover that both of these slim-packs are designed to live together permanently in the plastic case they come in -- I guess I assumed they would be packaged in individual cartons inside this case, but in fact the cards are loose inside and the 2 decks are separated by a (slightly too short) plastic divider. The plastic case is actually slightly LARGER than a standard deck, so definitely not a space-saver.So this 2-pack concept is not what I was looking for, packaging-wise. Which is fine -- not everyone's use case is the same as mine -- but I still find the design disappointing and impractical in general, because once you've removed the shrink-wrap that keeps them tightly bound, the 2 slim packs don't actually tuck very easily into the case. The process of trying to seat them neatly into their respective compartments and then close the case is just more fiddly than I'm willing to deal with (hur hur) on a regular basis -- not the biggest hassle in the world, but more annoyance than I would want to encounter from a deck of cards that sees regular use.All that said... I DO like the card design quite a bit, so what I'll probably do is DIY my own little box for one of the packs so that I can carry around a single one of these ""skinny"" packs. With that done I'll be pretty satisfied.Update: Google ""Super Deluxe Tuckbox Template Maker"" to find a very convenient generator that will help you make a custom tuckbox to fit this and other odd-sized decks. Huzzah! (Thanks to Craig Forbes & Elliott Evans)Final note: the box claims that these are easy to shuffle, so I'll briefly comment on that -- I'm a merely-competent shuffler but I can confirm that riffle shuffling is indeed easy with these. Hindu shuffling is more awkward, requiring a modified grip to keep from dropping cards, but that's just a matter of practice and building some new muscle memory.

  It is odd that they come in a single, large carrying case. I ended up using rubber bands around a single set to make these my travel cards. They take a bit of getting used to but I find them much easier to use than the tiny cards (equal to a quarter of a normal deck). They are easier to miss-shuffle but you get used to that pretty quickly also.

  Bought these cards for our spades games we like to play during bowling. However, after only halfway of first night of use, a card had already broken on its edge. These cards are very nice and flexible for shuffling but then can be so fragile and break. Since it was a Joker card that broke and simply needed for Spades, the deck has already now rendered itself useless. Now onto the next deck of the 3 remaining. For the price you pay for these cards compared to traditional, these should really stand up better in durability. I would much rather spill liquid on 3 regular decks and still be cheaper than ruining one deck of these cards because they can be fragile.
