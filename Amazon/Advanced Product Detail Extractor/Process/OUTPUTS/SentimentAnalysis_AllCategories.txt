              "Content": "  I think the Surface Go is a fantastic device if you don't set your expectations unreasonably high. For reference, I got the 64GB base model, a black type cover, and a Surface pen.After unboxing, setup takes slightly longer than \"just a moment\" as the device likes to say, but if you've already got a Windows 10 device, it's pretty quick and easy. Following the initial startup, the device will need to download a variety of updates, but within 2 hours or so mine was fully up to date after multiple installations, restarts, etc... standard computer update affairs.I switched it out of \"S mode\" almost immediately, because I didn't want to be bootstrapped to the Microsoft store, and it's nice that they give you the option. It doesn't require any restart or anything, and allows you to install apps from anywhere.Regarding performance, I have done email, lots of internet browsing and video watching, movies, drawing, and light photo editing and social networking. The device is not lightning fast and it doesn't need to be. It rarely lags more than a second or 2 to open programs but if you're used to a higher performing desktop or laptop then you will notice. The glossy screen is beautiful and photos and videos look great. There are front firing speakers that sound pretty decent but not much better than your average smartphone speakers, but this is understandable. The device makes zero noise as well, no fans or spinning disks are present here and it rarely gets hot to the touch.Really any light duty thing you would do on a normal Windows 10 PC can be done here. And that's where this thing shines, it's versatility is just head and shoulders above laptops because of how wonderfully portable it is. It feels sturdy, good in the hand or in the lap, and the fully adjustable kickstand is magnificent. In my opinion, the add on keyboard is absolutely essential. It clips on quickly and easily with nice strong magnets. The keys are small and take some getting used to, but having a full keyboard with back-lighting in this form factor is amazing. They are far better than on screen typing. The trackpad is also wonderful, it looks silly large on there but that is a good thing. It's responsive and has a nice clicky feeling.I don't think that the Surface Pen is nearly as essential, but it is fun and works excellent. I could see myself using it for casual note taking, there is virtually no noticeable lag.The charger the device comes with has a proprietary port, but you can also charge it via USB-C, which is great if you have a phone with that port, because you only need one charger while you travel.The only things worth complaining about on this device are made up for by its sturdy build and excellent functionality. It makes a fantastic bridge between the smartphone and PC, perfect for when a smartphone just isn't enough and a full size PC is too much. You don't even need to stow it during takeoff and landing on planes!!! So, set your expectations to a realistic level and the Surface Go, even the base model, will meet them.As an added bonus personally, the Surface Go has helped me use my smartphone less, to the point that I removed most social media from my phone. When you don't have Facebook and Instagram in your pocket at all times, it is pretty amazing how quickly you realize how often you used to mindlessly scroll through your feeds. So you could say it has made me more mindful of my screen time and helped me leave both it and my phone in my pocket or out of reach more often, which we could all use a break from now and then.One more thing... this one is just a tip. Don't buy office! This device has a small enough screen that it qualifies for the free version of MS Office Mobile. Search online for how to get them!UPDATE 2/4/19: I've owned this for several months now and have had zero issues. Changing out of S mode and installing Chrome and other non-Windows store programs has been no problem, no noticeable impact to memory usage or performance. Battery life is still good, just a great little device to have.",

I like the whole philosophy behind it, a device that you can take anywhere and use it in all your activities. After using it at work I can take the keyboard off and watch a movie or browse the web while listening some music or use a pen to do some digital painting as a hobby, It's just so versatile. I think this is the closest thing to what Microsoft wanted to achieve with the Surface line. Even closer than the already great Surface Pro.And there's this premium feel to it. The magnesium body feels very solid, the kickstand doesn't move if you don't want to and if you pair it with the Alcantara keyboard it's just a very different experience that you can feel. And yet it's so light. You'll have a disappointing experience touching a plastic laptop after using one of these.The downside is that it isn't precisely cheap. If you want it to be more than a tablet, you'll have to add the type cover keyboard, around $100 or more if you buy a Microsoft one (it's also great but I'm not reviewing it here). This just happens to be an affordable Surface product, and they're always expensive. But also so versatile and innovative that you'll find they worth it.It's also very sturdy. I found that out yesterday (there was a dog involved), it fell from a feet high right on the edge of the screen. I thought I would find a shattered or cracked display, but there was nothing on it. Not even on the edge, not a single dent or scratch on the whole thing, and it's working like if nothing happened (I'm using it to write this review).Most people complain about relatively short battery life but you can work for hours on it. I get it to work the whole day with the screen at its darkest and the battery saving mode on. Unless you use it outside that's enough brightness and performance for what you'll be using it. Another common complain are the thick bezels, but they're there for a reason, which becomes very obvious when you use it like a tablet.This might not be the device for you if what you want is high performance for CPU or graphic demanding tasks (and of course it's far from being a gamer PC) or if you really hate Windows. But if you're looking for a portable PC/tablet you can't go wrong with this. It's light, sturdy, completelly silent, has a sleek desing and offers a full desktop experience. And if you already own a Surface Pro you'll find this fascinating and even charming. It's a scaled down version of it.",

I got the 128Gb model and I would highly recommend not getting the $550 unless that's the absolute limit on what you can spend.Lets start with the screen. Despite the resolution hit compared to the Surface Laptop 3 this screen STILL looks amazing. Nice colors, the 3:2 aspect ratio is REALLY nice and I really wish laptop manufacturers would get the picture already and make 3:2 computers already for people that work more than they watch YouTube videos, and while it can't use the Surface Pen with this screen I think Microsoft thought that if you really need to buy a $140 pen you can probably afford the Surface Laptop 3. I kinda agree since this laptop doesn't really target the high end crowd, it's more of a budget computer.Keyboard feels great! The keys aren't mushy and they're also not obnoxiously loud. Just the right balance of noise to feel. Bad news though, the keyboard isn't backlit. Somewhat understandable since they need to get that advertised long battery life and backlit keyboards do suck a lot of power over time. They keys feel nice and evenly spaced out.

              "Content": "  I've been looking for a replacement for my 5-year-old MacBook Air and I think I may have finally found it in the Surface Laptop by Microsoft. There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I've used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I've used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where's charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI've been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I'd already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn't an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn't take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI've always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that's not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There's some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there's a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I'm not that worried about it, but just in case, I'll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I'm using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That's it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would've been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would've helped “future-proof” the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it's not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you're traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It's colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would've bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren't the best for reading documents and websites. I don't mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it's not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn't be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen—duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you're likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I've used the touchscreen, it's been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they're still laptop speakers, but they're some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much—more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360's keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop's. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It's fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren't making the switch is beyond me, but I think it's a huge mistake. If you're a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you've been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a “pro” or “gaming” laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that's integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I'm really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I've read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can't get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil's advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don't need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it's definitely a compromise that's understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won't be that noticeable unless you're frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn't going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I'm used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn't even know Marvell made wireless cards. I've had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I've read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I'm getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can't store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that's true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they'd learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it's a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I'd say it's no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don't think they'll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there's no other laptop I'd rather have right now.",

              "Content": "  The Surface Laptop 2 is one of the best laptops I've seen on the market. Spec wise it's a higher end laptop similar to the MacBook Pro lineups, but beyond that the Surface seemed like the better buy for a couple of reasons.PROS:- Beautiful touchscreen display: This stands out when comparing it to the MacBook Pro. The display between the Mac and the Surface is very similar but touch capability makes it easier than being limited to the touchpad only. I have to say my hand tends to stay on the touchpad anyways but the option of swiping or tapping the screen can make certain tasks easier to do. The laptop has decent brightness if you are working outdoors, although like pretty much any laptop you shouldn't be working on it in direct sunlight for the best results.- Amazing performance: I personally haven't compared the Surface Laptop 2 side by side to the MacBook Pro to get a decent comparison but the Surface definitely gets the job done. Whether I'm video editing or browsing the web the Surface runs all of these programs smoothly. With at least 8GB of ram you can run several tasks at once without any delay, it stood up to just about everything I threw at it. As long as you're not hardcore gaming on it the laptop runs smoothly- Amazing design: The design has stayed the same from last years model. The metal design on the outside of the laptop gives it a very smooth finish and premium feel. The laptop also has the alcantara fabric around the touchpad and keyboard which makes typing on the laptop easier on your wrists. Along with the design the laptop is fairly light and easy to carry around without too much effort.NEUTRAL:- Battery life: The battery life is decent on the laptop. With the high end processor and display it makes sense why the battery doesn't meet up to some people's expectations. I can get through a solid 6 - 7 hours of web browsing and occasional videos on a single charge. The charging cable for the laptop is compact so bringing it along shouldn't be a problem.CONSThunderbolt 3 and USB-C: Despite the features on this laptop it lacks Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ports. Although it's basically an upgrade from last years model it would have been nice if they implemented both of these in the laptop, but personally it isn't a deal breaker.Windows 10 Home: This laptop comes with Windows 10 Home, not the Pro version. This isn't any issue for me as much since I don't use any of the extra features the pro version provides. But BEWARE, this comes with Windows 10 Home.OVERALL:This laptop should suite most people in their day to day tasks. The performance should meet or exceed your expectations if you have a laptop older than 4 years so if you're looking for an upgrade this is definitely worth the buy. Keep an eye out for sales on the Surface Laptop 2 to get a even better deal for an amazing laptop!",

I'm learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark.

Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don't expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it's quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can't be ignored in 2019. It's very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it'll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn't great. I'm getting around 8 hours of power. That's having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it's nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don't take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn't test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we're already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn't for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you're going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It's disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you're pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can't attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can't tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I'm also irritated that Microsoft didn't at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you'll know that Microsoft put all their money on what's inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that's the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I'm always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can't do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you're getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer",

              "Content": "  The Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15\" model is certainly an excellent laptop and an extremely credible alternative to other premium Windows-based laptops, AND MacBook Pros. My current workhorse is the 2019 16\" MacBook Pro, so let's compare the two here, despite there certainly being a price difference.1.) The aluminum chassis is stunning. It's incredibly minimalist. If you think Apple is minimalist with its MacBook line, Microsoft takes it to the next level. A solid mass of black (in this reviewer's case), and ice cold to the touch.2.) Really lightweight at 3.4lbs, compared to 4.3lbs on the MacBook Pro 16. 2496 x 1664 (201ppi), - though not as good as on the MacBook Pro 16, (3072x1920, 226ppi), - still looks the part. Colors are not as vibrant as the MacBook Pro, only covering 75% DCI-P3 compared to 99% on the MacBook Pro, and the difference is really, really obvious. The display is certainly good, but in 2021 this isn't close to flagship. Throw in a pretty mediocre max screen brightness (380 cd/m2), this isn't great. The MacBook Pro 16\" will hit about 500cd/m2, and the difference side my side is staggering. It is a touch-screen, mind, but I'm still not convinced a touchscreen on a non-convertible laptop has tangible benefit to most users.The auto-brightness setup is very “jagged,” not a smooth fading up or down in brightness, - and I just turned this feature off as I found it very distracting.3.) The trackpad is responsive, though it's pretty small compared to the MacBook. While I prefer the nice, physical trackpad click on the Surface, the MacBook's trackpad allows you to “click” anywhere.4.) Port selection is really, really poor here. A single USB Type-A, a single USB Type-C, a headphone jack, and the Surface proprietary charging connector (something that really seems incredibly pointless, especially in 2021). No Thunderbolt ports of any sort here, which is a major oversight. Thankfully you can charge via the USB Type-C port so you don't have to use the Surface proprietary port if you don't want to.As an aside, setup of the Surface Laptop 4 is easy. Turn on, run through some initial setup, and you're done pretty quickly. Bloatware is kept to a complete minimum, and I only found myself removing Microsoft 365 and a few other extraneous apps.5.) The keyboard is good. It's not the best, a little spongier than the MacBook Pro 16's, with a slower rebound, but still among the “good” keyboards on the market, - reasonably tactile. It has physical F-keys, something I wish I had on the MacBook Pro 16. I think the TouchBar is one of the worst things to happen to MacBooks (inadvertent touches are the worst!), so I hope Apple reverts to physical keys this coming year on their flagship system. Rumor has it they will.6.) Ergonomics are decent, though it's actually a bit tricky to open the laptop as there's no indent where you're meant to flip the screen up, - a peculiar oversight. Bezels are a little large for 2021, but far from offensive.7.) Sound quality is not bad, but a far cry from the bass that the MacBook Pro 16 is able to generate. You could certainly listen to music here, but headphones would be preferred.8.) Battery life and thermals are absolutely fantastic, decimating the MacBook Pro for general usage, which is just a portable toaster. The laptop just runs remarkably cool with this AMD setup. That said, when the fans kick in, they kick in with a WHOOSH, which can be a bit disconcerting. Battery life is superb, easily giving me 8-11 hours for general web usage, a good 40% longer than my MacBook Pro doing the exact same things at a comparable brightness.  9.) The SSD is nothing too special. While yes, any SSD is faster than not-an-SSD, this is on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of NVMe performance.Overall, I really enjoy the Surface Laptop 4, but it's not hard to see where Microsoft could make some massive improvements and solidify the Surface line as THE Windows 10 systems to buy.4 out of 5. A worthy alternative to high-end laptops, but not yet at the top of its game.",

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The dedicated volume rockers on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go for content consumption or note taking, but I prefer the Yoga for content creation with it's larger screen and comfy keyboard. If you're docking all day and only occasionally need to be on the go then I recommend the XPS for its 32GB RAM. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.",

Once you're able to log on with mininfreezes every 3 seconds and screen blinking, the desktop is empty and wont load any icons or even the task bar.

I lightly tap the underside of the laptop and notice the screen flicker more as I do it. It's like the hardware is so close together its touching and shorting out everywhere.

So I convinced my wife to try the Laptop 2 -- I knew the Surface Pro or Surface Book wouldn't be what she needed, but the SL2 could be just the ticket.Especially based on reviews -- everyone gushed over how straightforward and effective this machine is, while being beautiful at the same time.So I order one for her.

The device I bought stopped working after 6 months. [Update: Fitbit sent me a replacement product, which  stopped working after less than five months].Customer service is terrible:- replacement for products under warranty take weeks to arrive (minimum “5 to 10 business days”)- Fitbit replaces defective products not with brand new items, but with refurbished pebbles (which won't last very long, given that even brand-new products break down after 6 months)- The warranty on the replacement items is only for the duration of the warranty left on the original product, rather than a new one-year warranty, which is standard practice for other companies. (this show the very poor confidence Fitbit employees have in their own products!)- It takes days to receive answers from customer support.- There is no compensation for customers who have to deal with defective products.

Being a diligent Amazoner I listened and ordered the \"old\" 4396810 blue filter from another source that appeared to have back stock.  Well they sent me the new filters! So I gave it a try.The packaging mentions it is still a PUR licensed filter.  I popped it in, ran out a gallon.

              "Content": "  I bought this a year ago to have it on hand when my current PUR filter wore out. The old filter is losing its flow, so I tried to put this one in. It will not snap into place. I pushed very hard on it, and it simply will not snap in. To make sure I was doing it right, I put the old filter back in, and that one snapped right in, no problem. The new white filter looks the same as the old blue filter with some minor differences that were pointed out by other reviewers. It looks like those minor differences are keeping this filter from working properly.I called the Whirlpool help line, and after 15 minutes on hold I finally connected to a customer support agent, who talked me through the installation procedure. It was the same procedure I was already doing, so I was not doing it incorrectly before. The filter would not snap in. He thought that it might be the wrong filter, but I have triple checked everything. I have the correct filter model for my fridge.The service agent thought that there might be something wrong with this filter since I did not buy it from Whirlpool. He told me to order one from them and it will fit. I placed the order, but I have not received it yet, so I cannot report on whether or not a filter from Whirlpool (actually, Every Drop) will fit better than the one sold by Amazon. I will update this if/when I receive the new filter and try it out.BTW, the new filter cannot be returned to Whirlpool for a refund if I open the packaging. Without opening the packaging, I will not be able to tell if the new filter will snap in to place or not. So there really is no return policy.  I am gambling my own 50 bucks on their hunch that the same filter from Whirlpool will fit while this one will not.The bottom line on this is that this filter does not fit in the Maytag MSD2559XEM refrigerator. Caveat.UPDATE:I ordered a filter directly from Whirlpool as recommended by their help line. The cost was $49.99 plus sales tax. I received the filter in about a week.The packaging of both the Whirlpool filter and the Amazon filter are identical, and the part numbers on the packaging, EDR3RXD1, are identical. The filters themselves are NOT identical. When placed side by side, you can see that on the Amazon filter, the body of the filter flares out as it goes into the end cap. On the filter from Whirlpool, the body flares out only a tiny bit, and meets the end cap mostly at a 90 degree angle. Other than that, they look identical. But that small difference seems to be key. The old blue PUR filter also does not flare out where the body goes into the end cap.The first time I tried to put the Whirlpool filter into the fridge, it did not snap in. However, I gave it one more try and replaced the old one to see exactly how much force is needed to get it to snap in. Even with the old filter, I had to give it one last nudge in order to get it to snap in, so I tried that on the Whirlpool filter, and it worked. So, the Whirlpool filter DOES fit, and the Amazon filter DOES NOT fit. I did not try to remove the new filter to see if it will come out. That would be tempting fate a bit too much.The bottom line is that there are at least two versions of this filter out there. One fits and the other does not, even though they carry the same part number. Caveat Emptor when buying third party filters.I ran water through the filter until it stopped spitting air (about two gallons). The water smells and tastes OK. I cannot detect any of the off odors or tastes that other reviewers have reported. The flow is fine. It will take a while to see how long the filter lasts.I am leaving this rating at one star because I am reviewing the filter that I bought from Amazon, not the filter that I bought from Whirlpool. They claim to be the same filter, but they are not. Because of the misrepresentation of the Amazon filter, I would remove my one star and give it a zero if I could. Caveat Emptor.",

My refrigerator is a Kenmore (actually a Whirlpool) side by side 106.53332300 (purchased back in 2003). I was concerned about reviews regarding this filter not working so I wrote to the company and I will include their response to me in my review. I've attached a photo of what the manufacturer info says on my filter package and as you will see from the response from Whirlpool, the filters made by 3M may be an issue for older refrigerators.--------------------------Thank you for contacting Whirlpool Consumer Direct Sales through our website.I am happy to assist you with your water filter questions.You are correct. Your replacement water filter is EDR5RXD1. That being said, we have noticed that older model refrigerators in the 8-10 year old range or older have had some issues with one of our newer filter. We do have two manufactures for this filter and with these models we have noticed that one will work and the other will be very difficult to install. It is possible but very difficult. Our engineers are working on a solution to this issue.If you order directly from us, our warehouse will ship what they have in stock and we have no control over which one they ship. If you are purchasing your filter at the store you can differentiate which one you are purchasing. On the bottom left side of the box you will see where it says \"manufactured for Whirlpool\" then it will say by.. and it will either say Kemflo or 3M for the manufacturer. If you look at the old filter you have been using you will either see it is flat at the top or has cut out notches in the top. One of these two filters will match the one that you have been using. I believe it is the one made by Kemflo that is working with the older models.We do have a 30 day return policy and a 90 day warranty so if you do order by phone and get one that doesn't work we would replace it for you. As of right now we just have no way to know which one the warehouse will be shipping. We hope to have a better solution for you soon. I do apologize for the inconvenience.Thank you for your email. Have a great day.If you have any additional questions or concerns, you may also reach our retail parts department at 1-800-901-2042 and choose the water filters option. Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m.to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.You are a valued Whirlpool customer and we appreciate your support of the Whirlpool Brand. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to assist you today. Have a good day!Sincerely,Billie P.Whirlpool Consumer Direct Sales-------------------------------------The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I find it very upsetting that there is this manufacturing issue where if you order the filter on any online source even through Whirlpool you can't know if it will fit until you get it!. With the original filter I never had to worry about that because it always worked. I sincerely hope Whirlpool will take this seriously and solve this engineering issue soon.----------------------------------------New Update, The filter I got from Amazon was the one made in Mexico. Although I was able to install it (it had a rounded top), my refrigerator had small water leaks at the dispenser for the 6 months that it was installed. It was minor or I would have changed the filter sooner but still annoying considering it is supposed to be the correct filter. Now I have the correct filter that I had to spend more money to purchase in town, made by Kemflo that has the notches on top and fits correctly. I downgraded my review to 2 stars because of the problem with having 2 manufacturers that make this same filter different causing fit and use issues.Basically, you will be taking your chances buying this filter online because you won't know which one you will get..",
