# WebScraper
- Various WebScrapers for different sites.  
- Each folder represents a website and there are serial and parallel running versions for the codes where the paralellism is provided by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries. The webscaper scripts output .csv files as results. Then, these .csv files are processed with some processor scripts in the corresponding folders using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and "bag of words" and "wordclouds" are outputted.
- Please refer to the readme files inside each folder for the correspoding code/program explanations.
